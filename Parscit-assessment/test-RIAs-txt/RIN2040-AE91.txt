Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
1-12 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
1 Introduction 
EPA is proposing to establish effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and new source performance standards 
(NSPS) for stormwater discharges from the Construction and Development (C&D) industry. These guidelines and 
standards would require discharges from certain construction sites to meet a numeric turbidity limit. The 
guidelines and standards would also require all construction sites currently required to obtain a National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to implement a variety of best management practices (BMPs) designed 
to limit erosion and control sediment discharges from construction sites. This Economic Analysis (EA) report 
assesses the overall cost and impact of three regulatory options, which are described below: 
¾ Option 1 establishes minimum sizing criteria for sediment basins used at construction sites with 10 or 
more disturbed acres draining to one location. Under this option, permittees would be required to install 
sediment basins that provide either 3,600 cubic feet per acre of runoff storage, or be designed to store 
runoff from the local 2-year, 24-hour storm event, whichever is less expensive. This option also includes 
requirement for implementing a variety of erosion and sediment controls on all construction sites that are 
required to obtain a permit. 
¾ Option 2 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, but in addition, requires construction sites of 30 
or more acres to meet a numeric turbidity limit in stormwater discharges from the site. The numeric 
turbidity standard would be applicable to stormwater discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-
year, 24-hour event. The turbidity standard would only apply to construction sites located in areas where 
the rainfall runoff erosivity factor (R-factor) as defined in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 
(RUSLE) is greater than or equal to 50 and if the soils on the site contain 10% or more by mass of soil 
particles smaller than 2 microns in diameter. 
¾ Option 3 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, but in addition, requires all sites with 10 or 
more acres of disturbed land to meet a numeric turbidity standard. The turbidity standard would apply to 
all sites, regardless of soil types or R-factor. The turbidity standard would apply to all stormwater 
discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-year, 24-hour event. 
EPA estimates that Option 1 would cost approximately $132 million dollars per year, reduce sediment discharges 
from construction sites by approximately 670 million pounds per year, and result in monetized benefits of $18 
million per year. EPA estimates that Option 2 would cost approximately $1.9 billion dollars per year, reduce 
sediment discharges from construction sites by approximately 26 billion pounds per year, and result in monetized 
benefits of $333 million per year. EPA estimates that Option 3 would cost approximately $3.8 billion dollars per 
year, reduce sediment discharges from construction sites by approximately 50 billion pounds per year, and result 
in monetized benefits of $471 million per year. 
This EA presents analyses and findings pertaining to:  
¾ Baseline business performance and condition of the C&D industry sectors and firms that would be 
affected by the proposed regulation; 
¾ Cost and economic/financial impact of the regulatory options to these firms and to the C&D industry as a 
whole; 
¾ Potential impact on the price and affordability of new single-family housing expected to be affected by 
the regulation; 
¾ Total cost to society, accounting both for the cost of meeting compliance requirements and for potential 
changes in C&D industry output and the associated loss in societal economic welfare;

¾ Economy wide effects, accounting for inter-industry linkages, in terms of net change in economic output 
and employment; 
¾ Potential impact on small businesses and governments in accordance with requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA); and, 
¾ Comparison of total social costs and estimated benefits.  
This chapter provides an overview of the proposed rule, the affected industries, the approach for estimating costs 
and impacts, and the key data sources within the economic analysis. Section 1.1 describes the background and the 
purpose of the proposed rule, highlighting requirements of the effluent limitation guidelines. Section 1.2 reviews 
the sectors within the C&D industry that are expected to be affected by the regulatory requirements. Section 1.3 
summarizes the analyses undertaken for assessing the costs and impacts of the regulatory options. Section 1.4 
summarizes the approach for estimating the benefits of the regulatory options. Section 1.5 reviews key findings 
from the economic analysis of the regulatory options.  
1.1 Background and Purpose of the Proposed Rule 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing Effluent Limitation Guidelines for discharges 
associated with construction and development activities under the authority of Sections 301, 304, 306, 308, 402, 
and 501 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act), 33 United States Code 
(U.S.C.) 1311, 1314, 1316, 1318, 1342, and 1361. 
Effluent Limitation Guidelines Schedule and Previous Actions Related to Construction and Development 
CWA section 304(m) requires EPA to publish a plan every 2 years that consists of three elements. First, under 
section 304(m)(1)(A), EPA is required to establish a schedule for the annual review and revision of existing 
effluent guidelines in accordance with section 304(b). Section 304(b) applies to ELGs for direct dischargers and 
requires EPA to revise such regulations as appropriate. Second, under section 304(m)(1)(B), EPA must identify 
categories of sources discharging toxic or nonconventional pollutants for which EPA has not published BAT 
ELGs under section 304(b)(2) or new source performance standards under section 306. Finally, under section 
304(m)(1)(C), EPA must establish a schedule for the promulgation of BAT and NSPS for the categories identified 
under subparagraph (B) not later than three years after being identified in the 304(m) plan. Section 304(m) does 
not apply to pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers, which EPA promulgates pursuant to sections 307(b) 
and 307(c) of the Act. 
On October 30, 1989, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC), and Public Citizen, Inc., filed an action 
against EPA in which they alleged, among other things, that EPA had failed to comply with section 304(m).  
Plaintiffs and EPA agreed to a settlement of that action in a consent decree entered on January 31, 1992 (Natural 
Resources Defense Council et al v. Whitman, D.D.C. Civil Action No. 89-2980). The consent decree, which has 
been modified several times, established a schedule by which EPA is to propose and take final action for 11 point 
source categories identified by name in the decree and for eight other point source categories identified only as 
new or revised rules, numbered 5 through 12. EPA selected the Construction and Development (C&D) category 
as the subject for new or revised rule #10. The modified decree called for the Administrator to sign a proposed 
ELG for the C&D category no later than May 15, 2002, and to take final action on that proposal no later than 
March 31, 2004. A settlement agreement between the parties, signed on June 28, 2000, requires that EPA develop 
regulatory options applicable to discharges from construction, development and redevelopment, covering site 
sizes included in the Phase I and Phase II NPDES storm water rules (i.e., 1 acre or greater). EPA is required to 
develop options including numeric effluent limitations for sedimentation and turbidity; control of construction site 
pollutants other than sedimentation and turbidity (e.g., discarded building materials, concrete truck washout,

trash); best management practices (BMPs) for controlling post-construction runoff; BMPs for construction sites; 
and requirements to design storm water controls to maintain pre-development runoff conditions where 
practicable.   
On June 24, 2002, EPA published a proposed rule for the C&D category that contained several options for the 
control of storm water discharges from construction sites, including effluent limitation guidelines and new source 
performance standards. (67 FR 42644; June 24, 2002). In a final action on April 26, 2004, EPA determined that 
national effluent limitations guidelines would not be the most effective way to control discharges from 
construction sites, and instead chose to rely on the range of existing programs, regulations, and initiatives that 
already existed at the federal, state and local level. (69 FR 22472; April 26, 2004). 
On October 6, 2004, NRDC and Waterkeeper Alliance, as well as the States of New York and Connecticut filed a 
motion against EPA alleging that EPA failed to promulgate ELGs and NSPSs as required by the Clean Water Act.  
On December 1, 2006 the district court, in Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, et al., C.D. Cal. 2006, Case No. CV 04-8307-GHK (RCx), held that CWA section 304(m), 
read together with CWA section 304(b), imposes on EPA a mandatory duty to promulgate effluent limitations 
guidelines and new source performance standards for industrial point source categories named in a CWA section 
304(m) plan. The court ordered EPA to publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register by December 1, 
2008 and to promulgate ELGs and NSPSs for the C&D category as soon as practicable, but no later than 
December 1, 2009. This proposal addresses the court order. 
NPDES Phase I and II Storm Water Rules 
As authorized by the CWA, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was 
established to control water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the 
United States. Storm water runoff from construction activities can have a significant impact on water quality. The 
NPDES storm water program requires operators of construction sites to apply for either a general permit or an 
individual permit under the NPDES Phase I and II storm water rules. Phase I of EPA’s storm water program was 
promulgated in 1990 under the CWA and addresses, among other things, discharges from construction activities 
disturbing 5 acres or more of land. Phase II of the NPDES storm water program, promulgated in 1999, expands 
the Phase I Rule by addressing storm water discharges from small construction sites disturbing between 1 and 5 
acres. In addition, operators of small construction sites are also required to develop and implement a storm water 
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), which includes implementation of the appropriate erosion and sediment 
control BMPs. The BMP selection and design are at the discretion of permittees (in conformance with applicable 
state or local requirements). Moreover, construction activities disturbing less than 1 acre are also included in 
Phase II of the NPDES storm water program if they are part of a larger common plan of development or sale with 
a planned disturbance of greater than or equal to 1 acre and less than 5 acres, or if they are designated by the 
NPDES permitting authority. 
Most states are authorized to implement the storm water NPDES permitting program.  However, EPA remains the 
permitting authority in a few states, territories, and on most land in Indian Country.  For construction (and other 
land disturbing activities) in areas where EPA is the permitting authority, operators must meet the requirements of 
the EPA Construction General Permit (CGP). 
The current CGP became effective on July 1, 2003 (as modified effective January 21, 2005) and expires on July 1, 
2008.  The permit expands coverage from the 1998 CGP that provided coverage for large construction sites (i.e., 
those disturbing greater than 5 acres) to include both small and large construction activities (i.e., any project 
disturbing greater than 1 acre).  Small construction activity was added to the CGP in response to the promulgation 
of the NPDES Phase II Rule.

EPA anticipates that some businesses and activities in the Heavy Construction sector (NAICS 237) will be 
affected by the Construction rule. However, with the exception of NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and bridge 
construction), data are not available to support an assessment of the number and character of projects performed 
by NAICS 237 sector businesses that would be subject to compliance requirements and incur compliance costs. 
For this reason, of the sectors in NAICS 237, only NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and bridge construction) is 
considered in the cost and impact analysis for the Construction rule.

1.3 Overview of Approach for Assessing Cost and Impact of the Proposed Rule 
For each of the regulatory options, EPA estimated total affected acreage and compliance cost from an engineering 
assessment of compliance requirements and construction activity that is likely to be affected by the specific 
requirements of a regulatory option. The costs were broken out by state, project size, and by the general industry 
sector (i.e., residential, non-residential, and transportation). To analyze the costs and impact of the proposed C&D 
industry regulation, EPA first identified and described the baseline condition of the economic entities expected to 
be subject to the regulation. EPA then used multiple approaches to assess the incremental changes in the baseline 
conditions of the affected entities and industries incurring compliance costs. Chapter 2, Economic Profile of the 
Construction and Development Industry identifies and characterizes the establishments, firms, employees, and 
revenue by the specific industry segments at the establishment- and firm-level. The profile also presents recent 
industry trends, industry characteristics, industry dynamics and an industry forecast. This information is important 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 1-17 
for establishing and understanding C&D industry analysis baseline, which is detailed in Chapter 4 Developing the 
Analysis Baseline. 
EPA used a number of methods to assess the economic impacts of the regulatory options on C&D businesses and 
consumers at the project-level, firm- and industry-level, regional-level, and at the state- and national-level. The 
methodologies developed within each of these sections – along with information from the industry profile – also 
provide the framework for developing key baseline metrics (Chapter 4). 
EPA undertook six analyses to examine the costs and impacts of the proposed rule. Additional analyses describing 
small business impacts and government-level impacts are also included within this EA. However, the key analysis 
for estimating the impact of the proposed rule is the Firm- and Industry-Level Analysis. This analysis provides 
total cost and impact measures based on the model firm. Brief summaries of the six analyses conducted by EPA 
are below. More detailed descriptions of the methodologies for each of these analyses can be found in Chapter 3.  
¾ Analysis of Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts. Assessment of compliance costs and economic 
impacts for model C&D projects. The primary purpose of the model building project framework is to 
develop the incremental compliance cost multipliers that are used to incorporate overhead, debt, and 
equity cost considerations into the per-acre engineering compliance cost estimates in subsequent analyses 
outlined in this document. 
¾ Analysis of Firm- and Industry-Level Economic Impacts. Assessment of the cost and economic/financial 
impact of regulatory requirements on C&D industry firms, and the potential industry-level effects in 
terms of numbers of firms that may be adversely affected, potential employment at risk, and total costs to 
the C&D industry for regulation compliance. 
¾ Analysis of Single-Family Housing Affordability Impacts. A regional assessment of housing affordability, 
where effects are assessed in terms of the expected change in price for median- and lower-quartile priced 
new single-family homes and the associated number of prospective home buyers whose purchasing 
decision may be affected due to these potential price effects. 
¾ Analysis of Social Cost. A state-level assessment of partial equilibrium market effects in the C&D 
industry building sectors is used to adjust the initial firm-level analysis estimate of resource cost of 
compliance for the likely reduction in the quantity of C&D industry output. The analysis also estimates 
the overall deadweight welfare loss to society arising from the change in each market’s equilibrium point. 
The quantity-effect-adjusted resource cost of compliance and the total dead weight loss comprise two 
components of the total social cost of the proposed rule. The analysis also estimates administrative costs 
to governments, which is an additional component of total social cost. 
¾ Analysis of Economy-Wide Economic Effects. An input-output analysis is performed that considers total 
economy effects – in terms of output and employment – by estimating the total change in demand for 
society’s resources arising from (1) compliance outlays, (2) the reduction in C&D industry output, and (3) 
administrative costs to governments. The analysis also estimates the net change in demand for society’s 
resources based on the economic effects arising from these two mechanisms of effect, i.e. output and 
employment.

1.4 Summary of Approach for Assessing Benefits of the Proposed Rule 
EPA analyzed four categories of quantifiable monetary benefits from the proposed C&D regulation: 
¾ Benefits to Navigation. Navigable waterways are often dredged to maintain their navigable depth and 
width. Reduced sediment settling in navigable channels is expected to reduce the frequency and therefore 
cost of dredging in these channels, as frequency and cost are related to the amount of sediment 
accumulated over time and therefore needed to be dredged; 
¾ Benefits to Water Storage. Water storage facilities, commonly called reservoirs, may also be dredged in 
order to regain capacity lost to sediment build-up. Reduced sediment settling in reservoirs is also expected 
to reduce the frequency and cost of dredging in reservoirs that are dredged; 
¾ Benefits to Drinking Water Treatment. Drinking water must be treated for sediment in turbidity, among 
other things, and treatment costs are related to the sediment and turbidity levels of the influent water. 
Reducing sediment and subsequently the turbidity that must be treated by drinking water treatment plants 
reduces the amount of chemicals needed for treatment, and also the amount of sludge generated from this 
treatment that must be disposed; and, 
¾ Water Quality Benefits. Reducing sediment levels in waterways has the general effect of improving water 
quality, as suspended sediment is one of the determinants of water quality. Increased water quality 
increases both the use and non-use value of waterbodies. EPA quantified the increased use value using 
willingness-to-pay estimates based on a meta-analysis of existing willingness-to-pay studies for improved 
water quality. 
The analysis methodology and findings for these benefit categories are presented in Sections 6.1 – 6.6. The total 
benefit resulting from the reduced sediment and turbidity levels in U.S. waters induced by this regulation is 
estimated as the sum of these four mutually exclusive categories of monetary benefits. Total benefits are 
summarized in Section 6.5. Lastly, Section 6.6 summarizes the key uncertainties and limitations underlying the 
analyses presented for each benefits category. 
1.5 Overview of Economic Analysis Results 
1.5.1 Firm- and Industry-Level Impact Results 
The estimated levels of cost, affected acreage, and resulting firm and industry impacts reported in Table 1-3 vary 
substantially over the three primary regulatory options analyzed.  
¾ For Option 1, the least costly of the three options, EPA estimates total costs of $132 million ($2008) 
occurring on a total of 119,000 affected acres. A total of 3,200 firms are estimated to incur compliance 
costs under this option. Out of these 3,200 firms, none are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 or 3 
percent of revenue, while 17 firms are estimated to incur financial stress. These 17 firms represent 0.5 
percent of all firms incurring cost and essentially zero percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. 
A total of 18 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of regulatory 
requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to experience 
negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be additive.  
¾ For Option 2, EPA estimates total costs of $1,890 million ($2008) occurring on a total of 290,000 
affected acres. Thus, cost and affected acreage under Option 2 are approximately 14.3 and 2.4 times the 
corresponding values under Option 1. A total of 6,400 firms are estimated to incur compliance costs under 
this option. Out of these 6,400 firms, 774 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue, and 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 1-19 
33 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. The 774 firms incurring cost exceeding 1 
percent of revenue represent 12 percent of the firms that are estimated to incur costs, but less than 1 
percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. When the effect of cost pass-through is accounted for 
in the cost-to-revenue analysis – i.e., costs are reduced by the amount of estimated offsetting revenue 
increase – 15 firms are estimated to incur (net) costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue. A total of 147 firms 
are estimated to incur financial stress as a result of regulatory requirements. These 147 firms represent 2.3 
percent of all firms incurring cost but less than 0.1 percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. A 
total of 103 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of regulatory 
requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to experience 
negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be additive. 
¾ For Option 3, the most costly option, EPA estimates total costs of $3,797 million ($2008) occurring on a 
total of 524,000 affected acres. Thus cost and affected acreage under Option 3 are approximately of 2.0 
and 1.8 times the corresponding values under Option 2. A total of 13,800 firms are estimated to incur 
compliance costs under this option. Out of these 13,800 firms, 2,475 are estimated to incur costs 
exceeding 1 percent of revenue, and 146 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. The 
2,475 firms with cost greater than 1 percent of revenue represent 18 percent of firms estimated to incur 
costs and 2.4 percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. The 220 firms incurring cost greater than 
3 percent of revenue represent 1.6 percent of firms estimated to incur costs. When the effect of cost pass-
through is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue analysis – i.e., costs are reduced by the amount of 
estimated offsetting revenue increase – 39 firms are estimated to incur (net) costs exceeding 1 percent of 
revenue. A total of 445 firms are estimated to incur financial stress as a result of regulatory requirements. 
These 445 firms represent 3.2 percent of all firms incurring cost but 0.3 percent of all firms in the affected 
industry sectors. A total of 389 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of 
regulatory requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to 
experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be 
additive.

EPA Estimates         
 
1.5.2 Single-Family Housing Affordability Analysis Results 
EPA assessed the potential affordability effects of the proposed regulation on prospective purchasers of new 
single-family homes. EPA performed this assessment on a MSA-by-MSA basis, accounting for differences in 
home prices and household incomes by MSA and differences in compliance costs by state. To account for 
potential differences in effect by housing price and by the numbers of households with incomes able to just afford 
a given home, EPA performed the assessment at two baseline single-family home price levels – median- and 
lower-quartile price home, by MSA.  
Table 1-4 reports, by regulatory option, the results of the affordability analysis for the median price home. The 
table reports the estimated dollar value and percentage change in the price for a new single-family home and the 
number of households in the market for a new, median-priced single family home whose purchasing decision may 
be practically affected by the price change. The price increase assumes: (1) a compliance cost based on the 
median lot size, 0.23 acres, for all new single-family housing as reported in the Census of Housing and (2) that 
compliance costs are fully passed through as an increased price to the home purchaser.1 This table also reports the 
number of affected households as a percentage of the total number of home-purchasing households that also 
                                                     
1  The 0.23 acre lot size is the median value for new single-family housing as reported in the Census’ 2006 Characteristics of New 
Housing, adjusted for additional land development associated with roadways, which is not accounted for in the Census’ lot size data.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 1-21 
qualify to purchase the median-priced home, before compliance cost effect. The key conclusion from this analysis 
is that, for all regulatory options, the total number of households incurring an affordability effect is small in 
comparison to the number of all likely single-family home buyers in any given year who can also afford the same 
home. For Option 2, this percentage is less than 0.1 percent. 
Table 1-4 also reports the effect of the estimated national average change in home prices on a typical monthly 
payment by comparing the baseline and post-compliance monthly payments for each option. For example, the 
median home price analysis shows increases in monthly payments of $1 for Option 1, $14 for Option 2, and $15 
for Option 3. In each case, the percentage increase in the monthly payment due to regulatory requirements is 
low – for example, 0.69 percent for Option 2. 
The table also presents the fraction of household income required to be saved to offset the effect of the regulation 
on the monthly mortgage payment via an increase in the initial down-payment. The table shows the fraction of 
income required to be saved in order to accumulate the increase in down-payment over 3, 6, and 12 month 
periods. In each case, the income used in the calculation is the income at which the prospective home buyer would 
just be able to purchase the home at the baseline price under conventional financing criteria. The results show, for 
example, that under Option 2, a household would need to set-aside 5.7% of their income over a 6-month period to 
offset the regulation’s effect on the mortgage payment. The fraction of income required to be saved decreases, for 
any savings time period, for households that earn income in excess of this minimum income requirement. 
Therefore, the affordability effects in this table are overstated to the extent that the income of the households that 
are interested in purchasing the median-priced home exceeds the minimum income threshold value.

EPA Estimates 
 
Below, Table 1-5 presents the results of the affordability analysis for the lower-quartile priced home. In 
performing this analysis, EPA used an additional, smaller lot size case to reflect the observation, from Census 
data, that lot size tends to decline with home price. As a result, the compliance cost burden and potential price 
increase for the lower quartile price home will tend to be lower than the values for the median price home. The 
smaller lot size is based on the median of lot sizes for attached new single-family housing, 0.08 acres, as reported 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
1-22 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
in the Census of Housing for 2006. The table reports, by regulatory option and for the two lot size cases, the 
estimated dollar value and percentage change in the price for a new single-family home and the number of 
households with an affordability effect. As expected, the number of households estimated to incur annually the 
affordability effect is smaller under the smaller lot size case of 0.08 acres (based on the median lot size for 
attached new single-family housing) than under the larger lot size of 0.23 acres (based on the median lot size for 
all new single-family housing): under Option 2, the estimated number of affected households declines from 3,243 
to 1,165. Because, from Census data, lot size tends to decline with home price, EPA judges that the smaller lot 
size provides a better basis for assessing the affordability effect for the lower-quartile price analysis than the 
larger lot size used in the analysis for the median price. Regardless of the lot size case, the number of affected 
home buyers is small in relation to the number of single-family home purchasers who qualify to purchase the 
lower-quartile price home in the baseline (e.g., about 0.03% to 0.08% of such households, depending on the lot 
size case).  
Table 1-5 also reports the effect of the estimated national average change in lower-quartile home prices on the 
total monthly payment by comparing the baseline and post-compliance monthly payments for each option and for 
the two lot size cases outlined above. The analysis shows small increases in monthly payments, ranging from 
0.36% - 1% for Option 2, depending on the lot size case. 
Lastly, the table presents the fraction of household income required to be saved to offset the effect of the 
regulation on the monthly mortgage payment via an increase in the initial down-payment. For Option 2, a 
household would need to set-aside between 3% and 8.5% of its income over a 6-month period to offset the 
regulation’s effect on the mortgage payment.

1.5.3 Social Cost of the Proposed Options 
The total social cost of the regulatory options is comprised of the quantity-adjusted resource cost of compliance, 
the deadweight welfare loss to society, and administrative costs to governments. The results of the social cost 
analysis are presented in Table 1-6.  
For Option 1, the least costly option, the total social cost is approximately $132 million with the total deadweight 
loss under $1 million (approximately $40,000). For Option 2, the total social cost is approximately $1,887 million 
with approximately $3.5 million in deadweight loss. Option 3, the most costly option, has a total social cost of 
approximately $3,790 million with approximately $8.2 million in deadweight loss.

1.5.4 Economy-Wide Effects of the Proposed Options 
EPA also estimated the total economic effects on output and employment due to the direct effects of the 
regulatory options. The analysis of total economic effects accounts for inter-industry linkages in the national 
economy by estimating the magnitude of output and employment changes derived from the resource cost of 
compliance, the direct change C&D industry output, and the output and employment effects resulting from 
administrative activities performed by Federal, State, and Local governments. EPA used input-output multipliers 
from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate the total economic 
effects of each option on the overall U.S. economy. The results are presented in Table 1-7.

EPA Estimates 
 
1.5.5 Projection of Costs and Acreage 
Because the detailed cost and economic impact analysis was performed for the baseline analysis year of 2002, 
EPA projected total social cost to 2010 to reflect the C&D industry’s anticipated activity level at the time the rule 
would be effective. EPA also projected total social cost to 2025 to capture the fuller cost effect of the rule over 
time. In this analysis, EPA accounted for the expected phase-in of compliance across over the first five years after 
promulgation as states renew their Construction General Permit, which will adopt and apply the provisions of this 
regulation to construction and development activities in their states (i.e., not all states will come into compliance 
during 2009; compliance will phase-in from 2010 to 2014). 
The results presented below in Table 1-8 differ in two important ways from the primary estimates of total social 
cost in Table 1-6: they account for the phase-in of compliance from 2010 to 2014 as states renew their CGPs, and 
they account for the expected change in industry activity from 2002 to each year from 2010 and beyond. In Table 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 1-25 
1-8, the first year of full compliance is 2014 because this is the first year when all states will have renewed their 
CGPs. In that year, the estimated total cost for Option 2 is $2,178 million. The difference between the 2002 
estimate of $1,887 million and the estimate of $2,178 in 2014 results from the expected increase in overall C&D 
industry activity. In 2010, the total cost of Option 2 is expected to be $173 million; this lower value reflects the 
fact that not all states are expected to have adopted the rule at that time, based on the expected schedule for states’ 
renewal of their CGPs.

1.5.6 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Results (RFA) 
The RFA provides that EPA generally define small businesses according to the size standards established by 
SBA. Based on SBA’s size criteria, EPA estimates that, of the 152,300 firms in the C&D industry sectors of 
concern for this regulation, approximately 148,800 firms – or about 98 percent – are defined as small businesses. 
Although a large percentage, and large absolute number, of C&D businesses are small businesses, EPA’s analysis 
found that many of these firms are not likely to complete projects that fall within the coverage size thresholds of 
the regulatory options considered in this analysis. As shown in Table 1-10, EPA estimated that a much smaller 
number of small businesses – approximately 78,100 firms – are capable of performing in-scope projects than the 
total of small businesses, approximately 148,800, in the total Construction industry. From this analysis, 70,700, or 
47 percent, of the small businesses in the Construction industry sectors of concern are estimated not to be capable 
of performing in-scope projects. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
1-26 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
The impacts of these regulatory options on small businesses are summarized below: 
¾ For Option 1, EPA estimates that approximately 2,300 small businesses will incur costs. These 2,300 
firms represent about 1.5 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 3 
percent of those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of 
a C&D regulation. EPA estimates that none of these small businesses incur costs exceeding 1 or 3 percent 
of revenue, regardless of whether the expected increased revenue offset to compliance costs is accounted 
for in the cost-to-revenue comparison. In these 2,300 firms, EPA estimates that 12 will potentially incur 
financial stress as a result of the regulatory option and 14 would potentially incur negative net business 
value – an indicator of potential closure. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be 
estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact 
may not be additive. The number of small businesses estimated to incur financial stress or potential 
closure, represent approximately 0.01 percent of the total small businesses in the C&D sectors and about 
0.02 percent of those estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. 
¾ For Option 2, EPA estimates that approximately 3,700 small businesses will incur costs. These 3,700 
firms represent about 2.5 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 5 
percent of those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of 
a C&D regulation. For this option, EPA estimates that about 395 small businesses would incur costs 
exceeding 1 percent of revenue and 17 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 3 percent of 
revenue – without accounting for the expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs. Both 
numbers represent very small percentages of the small firm universes. The 395 firms estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue represent about 0.2 percent of all small C&D sector firms and 0.5 
percent of estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. The 17 firms estimated to incur costs 
exceeding 3 percent of revenue are less than one-tenth of a percent of both small business counts. If the 
expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue calculation, 
7 small businesses are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue and none are estimated to 
incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. EPA estimates that 81 small businesses will potentially incur 
financial stress and 56 are potential closures. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may 
also be estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial 
impact may not be additive. Although these impact values are higher than the numbers for Option 1, the 
Option 2 estimates remain small percentages of the small firm counts. 
¾ Option 3 imposes a higher economic/financial burden on small businesses than Option 2, although the 
impact values, when considered as percentages of total and in-scope small businesses, remain small. For 
Option 3, EPA estimates that approximately 10,200 small businesses will incur costs. These 10,200 firms 
represent about 7 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 13 percent of 
those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of a C&D 
regulation. For this option, EPA estimates that 1,868 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 1 
percent of revenue and 111 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue – again, 
without accounting for the expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs. The 1,868 firms 
estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue represent about 1 percent of all small C&D sector 
firms and 2 percent of estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. The 111 firms estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue are 0.1 percent of the small in-scope firms. If the expected cost pass-
through offset to compliance costs is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue calculation, 28 small businesses 
are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue and no small businesses are estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. EPA estimates that 318 small businesses will potentially incur 
financial stress and 295 are potential closures. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may 
also be estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial 
impact may not be additive.

1.5.7 Estimated Benefits of the Regulatory Options 
EPA estimated the total benefits under each regulatory option by summing the benefits estimated for each of four 
monetized benefits categories: benefits to navigation, water storage, drinking water treatment, and water quality. 
Table 1-11 presents low, midpoint, and high estimates of benefits under each regulatory option. 
Table 1-11 summarizes monetized benefits for navigable waterway dredging and water storage calculated using 
both 3 and 7 percent discount rates. Benefits for for drinking water and WTP were calculated using a single year 
timeframe and did not require annualizing. Total national benefits vary significantly among the three regulatory 
options: under Option 1, the estimated benefits range from approximately $6 million to about $39 million, while 
benefits under Option 3 are estimated to range from $210 million to $956 million (assuming a 3 percent discount 
rate). 
Under EPA’s preferred regulatory option (Option 2) assuming a 3 percent discount rate, the estimated benefits 
range from $136 million to $683 million. The midpoint estimate is $332.9 million. Non-market benefits estimated 
based on household WTP for surface water quality improvements account for the majority of total benefits from 
the C&D regulation. The estimated WTP for water quality improvements from reduced sediment discharges from 
construction sites under Option 2 ranges from $104.6 to $634.7 million with a mean value of $295.0 million. The 
estimated cost savings to industry and government through reduced costs of navigable waterway maintenance, 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction 
1-28 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
reservoir dredging, and drinking water treatment ranges $31.3 million to $48.8 million, with a midpoint estimate 
of $37.9 million. Under Option 2, avoided cost benefits account for 7 to 23 percent of total benefits.  
Under the most stringent option (Option 3), the expected cost savings are $70.9 million per year; WTP also 
increases to a mean value of $398.5 million. The estimated midpoint total national benefits are $469.5 million.

1.5.8 Comparison of Total Social Cost and Monetized Benefits  
EPA estimated and compared the total expected social cost and monetized benefits for each regulatory option.  
The estimated total social cost includes: 
1. The resource costs of compliance to the private sector and to governments. The resource cost to society of 
each regulatory option refers to compliance outlays after adjusting for the expected C&D market 
contraction due to the proposed options. 
2. The deadweight loss to society. The deadweight loss to society refers to the net losses of both consumer 
and producer surplus arising from the post-compliance market equilibrium adjustment associated with 
each option. 
3. Administrative costs to federal, state, and local governments. The expected administrative costs refer to 
state and local governments’ administration of federal rule requirements to regulated entities within their 
jurisdictions. EPA expects a relatively small administrative burden to government entities under the 
proposed options for the review and processing of Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) for projects 
that incur cost under the proposed rule. 
The reduction of sediment and other pollutants entering surface waters from construction sites as a result of the 
C&D regulation will have a wide range of market and nonmarket benefits, as described in Chapter 6. As 
described in Chapter 6 and emphasized here, EPA’s estimate of total monetized benefits does not represent the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 1: Introduction

full-range and magnitude of benefits expected from this rule because certain categories of benefits are not able to 
be monetized. These non-monetized categories include primarily benefits to commercial fishing and shellfishing 
or benefits to industrial and agricultural water use. Total estimated monetized benefits in the table below include 
benefits to navigation, benefits to water storage, benefits to drinking water treatment, and benefits to water 
quality. 
Table 1-12 presents the estimated total social cost and monetized benefits. The estimated social costs exceed the 
monetized benefits. It is important to emphasize that Chapter 6 discusses several other classes of benefits that 
could not be monetized but that are likely to provide social benefits, and therefore, the estimate of monetized 
benefits is not as complete an estimate as that of total social cost.

2 Economic Profile of the Construction and Development Industry 
2.1 Introduction 
The Construction and Development (C&D) industry plays an integral role in the nation’s economy, contributing 
approximately five percent of Gross Domestic Product. Furthermore, approximately 10 percent of the nation’s 
nearly 7 million total business establishments are in the C&D industry, demonstrating the dominance of small 
firms in this industry. The number of paid employees in the C&D industry accounts for 6.6 percent of total U.S. 
employment (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005a). Establishments in this industry are involved in a wide variety of 
activities, including land development and subdivision, homebuilding, remodeling, construction of nonresidential 
buildings and other structures, and heavy construction work (including roadways and bridges). Establishments are 
also involved in a myriad of special trades, such as plumbing, roofing, electrical, excavation, and demolition 
work. Some of these activities result in land disturbance, which can cause erosion and transport soil and sediment 
in stormwater runoff. The regulatory options presented in this economic analysis report address these concerns.  
Several characteristics of the C&D industry affect the structure of this economic analysis: 
¾ Residential construction represents a large percentage of construction industry activity. Approximately 50 
percent of the establishments included within the following analysis are residential contractors. In 
addition, approximately 32 percent of the total value of construction comes from residential construction. 
Therefore, individuals (e.g., homebuyers) are often the direct customers of the C&D industry. With 
residential housing representing a substantial share of total C&D industry activity, it is important to 
understand the potential effect of the C&D regulation on housing prices and housing affordability. 
¾ Developers and builders work under a range of relationships in performing construction services. For 
example, developers may undertake all site improvements and sell completed lots directly to builders, or 
act as builders themselves and remain onsite to build out the development, or some combination of the 
two. Thus, both developers and builders may be the parties that are directly subject to the C&D 
regulation’s compliance requirements. 
¾ The C&D industry includes a very large number of small businesses. Therefore, EPA carefully considered 
the impacts on small businesses in accordance with RFA requirements in developing the options 
considered for this regulatory proposal and in choosing the option for proposal. As reported in Section 
2.4.4 of this chapter, EPA estimates that 95 percent or more of the firms in the C&D industry are small 
businesses according to Small Business Administration criteria. 
¾ C&D activities are undertaken in markets in which business conditions vary substantially both over time 
and space. Furthermore, these regional variations in business conditions can persist for several years 
because of the immobile and long-lived character of the C&D industry’s output product. Some factors 
affecting business conditions in C&D markets are national in character – e.g., interest rates and overall 
performance of the national economy – while other factors are more local in character – e.g., differences 
in regional economic and population growth patterns, differences in performance of sectors that are 
regionally concentrated, and the character of the supply/demand balance in a given local market. The 
highly local and varying character of C&D markets means that the economic analysis for the C&D 
regulation must account for these variations in market conditions, both over time and across local 
markets.

2-2 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
¾ Under the standard C&D industry definitions, the industry includes a large number of establishments 
primarily engaged in remodeling activities and special trades (e.g., plumbing, electrical). These 
establishments, however, are less likely to be involved in land-disturbing activities and thus are not likely 
to be subject the C&D regulation’s requirements. Chapter 4 describes in more detail the breakout of the 
entities within the C&D industry that would either not engage in land-disturbing activities or would not 
be an NPDES permittee or co-permittee. Since these entities are not likely to be affected by this 
regulation, they will not be included in the cost and economic impact analysis for the C&D rule.  
¾ The C&D regulation will apply only to activities that occur on land in the United States. Accordingly, 
competition from production of C&D industry products in international markets is not important for 
analyzing the impacts of this rule. If international firms engage in C&D production activities on U.S. 
land, they will be subject to the C&D regulation in the same way as U.S. firms and can gain no 
competitive advantage from a different level of regulation in their home countries. Similarly, any 
requirements applicable to U.S. firms in their domestic operations will not apply to their production 
activities in other countries. As a result, the C&D regulation will not affect U.S. firms’ competitiveness in 
supplying their products in foreign countries. 
¾ Since late 2006, residential construction has experienced a slowdown in housing starts: 2005 was a peak 
year for residential construction but current forecasts for the remainder of 2008 and continuing into 2009 
remain weak. On the other hand, nonresidential construction has been on a positive growth trend. Though 
the non-residential sector may experience declines starting in late 2008 through early 2010, the 
performance of the sector is expected to resume positive growth in 2010. The average consensus from the 
American Institute of Architects (comparing six different forecasts from January 2008, see Table 2-26) 
forecasts 2008 to experience a 0.57 percent increase in the number of nonresidential construction starts 
and a 1.03 percent decrease in 2009 (AIA, 2008).2 
The C&D industry, as defined for this rule, is comprised of three main industry groups. 
1. Construction of buildings 
a. Residential: single-family, multifamily, remodelers, and operative construction 
b. Non-Residential: industrial and commercial/institutional building construction 
2. Heavy and civil engineering construction 
3. Specialty trade contractors: excavation contractors, wrecking and demolition contractors, and all other 
heavy construction. 
Of these three industry groups, only the first two are likely to engage in land-disturbing activities and could be an 
NPDES permittee or co-permittee, and thus be within the scope of the proposed C&D rule. Furthermore, within 
the building construction category, residential remodelers are not included as a category that would be likely to 
engage in land-disturbing activities. EPA is concerned with stormwater runoff from construction sites, which 
carries sediment (and potentially metals and nutrients) into receiving waters, impairing water quality. These 
activities include site clearing or site preparation activities, such as tree removal, excavation, blasting, scraping, 
grading, etc. These activities can destabilize soils and create conditions that allow stormwater to accumulate and 
flow across the site. This increase in stormwater flow can cause erosion and lead to the transport of soil particles 
and attached pollutants, which eventually can be conveyed offsite and discharged into receiving waters. Both the 
                                                     
2  The current economic situation is still continuing to evolve since events taking place during the later part of 2008 have triggered 
further downturns in the economy. Therefore, since many of the forecasts listed within this profile generally reflect conditions present 
in the earlier part of 2008, the recovery projected here may be further in the future. For example, Global Insight’s October 2008 “U.S. 
Executive Summary” expects  that housing starts will not hit bottom until the second quarter of 2009 at around 740,000 units, to 
gradually improve thereafter, and not reach the estimated trend until 2012/2013.

increased flow and associated pollutant and sediment loads that result from land-disturbing activities can 
negatively impact the biological, physical, and chemical characteristics of the receiving waters. 
EPA believes that many establishments in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 236 
(Construction of Buildings) and NAICS 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) are likely to engage in 
such activities on a regular basis. However, as described above and within Chapter 4, although establishments 
within selected five-digit industries that are part of NAICS 238 (Specialty Trade Contractors) could engage in 
land-disturbing activities3, they are generally contracted by the NPDES permit holder and therefore will not be 
directly affected by the proposed regulation. Table 2-1 lists the industry groups whose activities will likely be 
within the scope of the regulation. Table 2-1 lists these industry groups according to the 2002 NAICS framework 
and with the correspondence to the previous 1997 NAICS framework. As described below, changes in the NAICS 
framework definitions between 1997 and 2002 affect the analysis of industry data over time and the ability to 
merge data from separate sources.

Trenching Contractors) (all 1997 classifications).

As shown in Table 2-1, each 2002 NAICS industry includes one or more industry groups defined under the former 
1997 NAICS industry codes. For the 2002 Economic Census, the Census Bureau redefined the NAICS code 
structure for certain C&D industry segments, making direct comparisons between the 2002 and 1997 Economic 
Census data not straightforward. Furthermore, in the 1997 Economic Census, the Census Bureau switched from 
reporting data on a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) basis to a NAICS basis, adding to the difficulty of 
comparing data from 2002 and 1997 with that from the 1992 and earlier Economic Census-reporting periods 
(comparison of these industries is found in Appendix 2-1). Within this economic profile, the objective is to

provide data at the most detailed level possible, while still maintaining the ability to provide meaningful 
comparisons between 2002 and earlier Economic Census periods.  
With this goal in mind, EPA identified and characterized the specific industry segments that meet the criteria of 
performing land development and disturbance activities that are within the scope of the proposed regulation and 
that will be subject to regulatory requirements based on the NPDES permitting process. The presentation in this 
chapter and Chapter 4 of this regulatory analysis attempts to achieve consistency of data over the three reporting 
frameworks covering the C&D industry data over this time frame. In some instances, the adjustments to support 
comparisons involve estimations and reclassifications that are likely to contain an unknown degree of error.  
As a result of these adjustments, the NAICS segments covered in this regulatory analysis include: 
¾ NAICS 236 – Construction of buildings (all subsectors except residential remodelers) 
¾ NAICS 237310 – Heavy and civil engineering construction4 
2.1.1 Data Sources Used 
This profile uses several data sources to characterize the C&D industry. The primary data source is the 2002 
Economic Census, conducted every five years by the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Small Business 
Administration (SBA) and Census Bureau also provide important information in Statistics of U.S. Business 
(SUSB). SUSB provides firm-level data that is particularly important for the firm and industry impact assessment 
and for the small entity analysis (the Economic Census data is reported at the level of the construction 
establishment, not the firm). Table 2-2, below, compares the Economic Census and SBA data to further clarify the 
differences and identify how each data source is used in this regulatory analysis. To a large degree, this chapter 
relies on data from the 2002 Economic Census to profile the C&D industry, since that source provides a greater 
level of detail on industry characteristics.

a The Census Bureau defines an establishment as “a relatively permanent office, or other place of business, where the usual business activities related to 
construction are conducted” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005a). 
b The Small Business Administration defines a firm as “the aggregation of all establishments owned by a parent company (within a geographic location 
and/or industry) that have some annual payroll.” (U.S. SBA, 2004). Therefore, one firm could comprise several establishments. 
 
2.1.2 Organization of this Chapter 
The purpose of this profile is to provide an overview of the C&D industry, describe its key characteristics and 
structure, and analyze current and historical trends. Section 2.2 presents key findings concerning the C&D 
industry and the potential economic/financial impact of the proposed regulation. Section 2.3 includes a summary 
of recent trends regarding the industry characteristics and the industry’s financial condition. Section 2.4 presents 
                                                     
4  EPA anticipates that some businesses and activities in the Heavy Construction sector (NAICS 237) will be affected by the C&D rule. 
However, with the exception of NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and bridge construction), data are not available to support an 
assessment of the number and character of projects performed by NAICS 237 sector businesses that would be subject to compliance 
requirements and incur compliance costs. For this reason, of the sectors in NAICS 237, only NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and 
bridge construction) is considered in the cost and impact analysis for the C&D rule.

detailed characteristics of the C&D industry, including both industry and firm-level data. Section 2.5 covers the 
industry economic and financial outlook.  
2.2 Key Findings 
Overall, the Construction and Development industry has shown a substantial increase in the number of 
establishments and employees over the past 10 years. Although some segments of the industry are experiencing 
substantial economic weakness during the near term – due to weakness in residential housing markets, difficult 
credit markets, and weakness in the general economy – total economic activity and economic/financial 
performance in the industry is projected to remain strong over the longer term. Department of Labor projections 
indicate the industry will add approximately 1 million new construction jobs between 2002 and 2012 (U.S. 
Department of Labor, 2006). 
SBA data on births and deaths of establishments and employment also show that the number of establishments 
and employees has generally grown over the past 10 years. At the same time, the industry has experienced periods 
of economic weakness, with year-to-year losses in establishments in 2001/2002, employees in 1999/2000, and in 
both establishments and employees in 2000/2001. This period of sector weakness reflects the overall weakness of 
the U.S. economy in the period, leading up to and through the short recession of 2002. More recently 
(2006/2008), the housing-related segments of the C&D industry are in a period of substantial business weakness, 
resulting in large part from an aggressive pace of new construction, fueled in part by low interest rates and “easy 
credit” from 2003 to 2007, followed by housing supply growth outpacing demand growth in a substantial number 
of U.S. markets. The current weakness accelerated during 2007 as the result of a tightening in residential 
financing terms and the deterioration of credit markets and the general economy in 2008. The consequent slow-
down in residential construction caused a substantial weakening of business performance for C&D businesses 
whose activity is concentrated in the residential market.  
Regionally, the decline in the housing market has been most evident in the Southwest, Florida, and some areas in 
the Northeast. In California, Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Massachusetts, large home price increases were a 
major factor underlying a surge of new and existing home inventory; the inventory surge was followed by price 
declines. Even so, these recent home price decreases are small relative to housing prices (Global Insight, 
September 2007). Florida and Nevada also experienced the largest decrease in new housing starts from 2005 to 
2007, dropping approximately 58 and 47 percent, respectively. These states also hold the highest shares of 
construction activity compared to total Gross State Product (GSP) (Florida 7.5 and Nevada 9.8 percent) and total 
state employment (Florida 7.6 and Nevada 11.0 percent). Global Insight expects that home prices will continue to 
drop in only a handful of states, including California and Arizona, until 2009 and 2010 when a recovery is 
expected. Part of the recovery will be due to the forecasted increase of population, employment, and personal 
income growth among Florida and the Southwestern states. 
Unlike residential construction, non-residential construction has continued to achieve moderate business 
performance and growth. This performance in non-residential construction has partially offset the decline in the 
residential sector. Since the cyclical low in non-residential construction in 2003, this sector remained relatively 
flat until the end of 2005 when a steady recovery began. Retail construction (generally coinciding with residential 
construction trends) continued to have strong growth until mid-2007, even with residential construction beginning 
to decline during 2006. The lodging sector, although very cyclical, saw a sharp increase in growth from 2005 until 
mid-2007. And, in general, healthcare construction also experienced strong growth in 2006. However, more 
recent forecasts by industry analysts indicate that the non-residential construction market is expected to moderate 
with flat growth for the next few years.

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 2-7 
A key consideration for the analysis of the proposed rule concerns the extent to which any rule-related increase in 
construction costs will be passed through to consumers of the C&D industry. A number of market factors will 
influence the extent to which construction cost increases will be passed through to consumers at a given point in 
time, in a given market segment (e.g., commercial real estate vs. residential real estate), and in a given location. In 
general, elasticities of supply and demand in a market will influence the extent of cost pass-through. Many factors 
contribute to the relationship between supply and demand elasticities and overall market conditions in a given 
market and at a given point in time. These factors include general economic factors – for example, monetary and 
credit conditions, condition of the overall economy, etc. – and factors that are more local in character – for 
example, regional economic strength; extent to which a particular market has seen a substantial recent increase 
in supply in a particular real estate segment, which has exceeded the underlying strength in demand, etc.  
Currently, the national residential real estate housing market is experiencing a period of considerable weakness, 
due, as described above, to several factors, including “over-building” in some markets through the middle of the 
decade, difficult access to credit, increased supply of existing housing from foreclosures, and more recently, 
general economic weakness. However, the extent of the residential market weakness varies substantially over 
specific regional and local markets. As noted above, markets in the Southwest, Florida and areas of the Northeast 
are experiencing relatively greater price and sales volume weakness. At the same time, some markets that recently 
experienced less growth in supply and prices (e.g., parts of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest), are experiencing 
much less of a fall-off in prices and sales volume. In those markets with greater weakness in prices and sales 
volume, there is a greater likelihood that near-term increases in construction costs may be not be fully passed 
through to customers. In these instances, increased construction costs may be absorbed by the owners of the 
undeveloped land, project developers, and the builders of new construction. Based on recent forecasts by real 
estate industry analysts (e.g., Global Insight), this period of general weakness in residential real estate markets 
may persist through 2008 and into 2010. Nevertheless, over the longer term, it is reasonable to expect that market 
conditions will adjust to any changes in construction costs and that regulation-induced cost increases will become 
part of the “new equilibrium” and will be passed through in prices to consumers. 
Similar considerations will apply to other segments of real estate markets (e.g., commercial real estate) whose 
supply costs may be affected by a C&D regulation. Currently, the general conditions in these other segments are 
sufficiently stronger overall than in the residential segment such that there is a greater likelihood that all or most 
of any rule-related construction cost increase will be passed through to consumers. However, should these 
segments weaken over the next few years, which is discussed as possible in the final section of this chapter, the 
likelihood that cost increases might not be able to be recovered fully in increased prices would increase.  
As described in the final part of this chapter (Section 2.5: Industry Dynamics and Forecast, page 2-38), overall, 
the construction industry is expected to experience continuing weakness until residential markets work through 
the current inventory of unsold homes and credit markets and the general economy return to a better condition. A 
recent (October 2008) Global Insight forecast suggests that the industry is expected to witness further declines for 
both the residential, non-residential, and non-building sectors. Housing starts, a good indicator of the strength of 
the residential sector, are expected to hit bottom in mid to late 2009 and gradually improve thereafter. Non-
residential spending, which often lags behind the pattern in the residential sector, is expected to see declines in 
private non-residential building through late 2008 into the first quarter of 2010. Furthermore, the non-building 
sector (i.e. publicly-funded projects), is expected to see further declines due to the slowing of revenue growth.  In 
short, though the industry is expected to experience declines over the next couple years, the industry is expected 
to achieve expected positive business performance over the longer-term and beginning around 2010/2011. Given 
this outlook, EPA judges that the construction industry will be on the path to achieve a sufficient recovery to 
sustain the compliance costs of the C&D rule without substantial economic/financial burden during the period in 
which compliance with the regulation would begin.

2.3 Recent Trends in the C&D Industry 
This section reviews recent trends in the number of establishments, firms, and employees in the C&D industry 
and in the value of construction by key activity segments. Overall, these data show that the industry has grown 
substantially over the past 10-15 years in terms of total value of business performed. However, the data also show 
that the various segments of the industry have experienced periods of weakness with brief declines in value of 
business performed. These periods of weakness don’t necessarily occur simultaneously in all segments of the 
industry. Declines in commercial real estate occurred during the earlier years of the current decade while 
residential real estate construction was growing strongly. Currently, the residential segment is experiencing 
weakness while the commercial segment remains relatively strong.  
2.3.1 Establishments by C&D Industry Segment 
Table 2-3 and Table 2-4 present the number of C&D establishments in 1992, 1997, and 2002. Between 1992 and 
1997, the number of C&D industry establishments with payroll increased 12.8 percent, from 214,435 to 241,840. 
Between 1997 and 2002, the number of establishments with payroll increased an additional 8.2 percent to 261,585 
(see Table 2-3 and Table 2-4). However, the modest increase in total number of establishments masks some 
significant offsetting changes in establishment counts among groups within the industry as defined by NAICS.  
These data are reported below in two tables that distinguish between the different 1997 and 2002 NAICS 
frameworks.5 The 1997 NAICS framework reported the All Other Heavy Construction category as NAICS 23499, 
and thus as a part of the NAICS 234 3-digit sector. The 2002 NAICS framework reassigned the 1997 All Other 
Heavy Construction category over three different 3-digit sectors: NAICS 236 (Construction of Buildings), NAICS 
237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), and NAICS 238 (Specialty Trade Contractors). To facilitate 
comparisons of activity data over the period 1992-2002, Table 2-3 maintains the 1997 grouping method in 
displaying the 2002 data – that is, the All Other Heavy Construction categories data within 2002 NAICS 236, 237, 
and 238 were reassigned back into their 1997 classification of NAICS 234990. Table 2-4 displays the data 
according to the NAICS framework definitions applicable during each reporting period – that is, for 1992 and 
1997, All Other Heavy Construction remains within NAICS 234; for 2002, this sector is reported in NAICS 236 
and 237. The two different classifications in these tables result in offsetting differences in the values for NAICS 
237 in 2002.  
The summaries below are derived from the data in Table 2-3, which provides the more consistent comparison of 
establishment counts by NAICS sector over the full analysis period. However, the rest of the data reporting and 
analysis in this chapter will be derived from the current NAICS framework.  
¾ The number of establishments in the Land Subdivision industry group (NAICS 2372) decreased by 7.5 
percent between 1992 and 1997 and increased by 2.7 percent between 1997 and 2002. 
¾ Between 1992 and 1997, the number of establishments in Residential and Nonresidential Construction 
(NAICS 236) increased by 13.5 percent. The number of establishments increased by another 10.7 percent 
between 1997 and 2002. 
¾ The number of establishments in Heavy Construction increased by 14.5 percent between 1992 and 1997 
and continued to increase by 16.2 percent from 1997 to 2002. 
                                                     
5  This profile uses the 2002 NAICS framework. Since the 2002 NAICS classification reassigned the Specialty Trade Contractors section, 
some 1997 classifications have been used to further divide this section. Appendix 2-1 at the end of this chapter provides a cross-walk to the 
complete 2002 NAICS classifications for the C&D industry. The Census Bureau classifies industries according to the North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS). Under NAICS, economic activity is divided into twenty broad two-digit industry codes. One of 
these is Construction (NAICS 23), which is further divided into three-, four-, five-, and six-digit levels, as described in this chapter.

2.3.2 Firm/Establishment and Employment Births and Deaths 
Figure 2-1 through Figure 2-4 report year-to-year changes in firm, establishment, and employment counts for the 
U.S construction industry and for the U.S economy as a whole, over the period 1998-2004. These values are 
reported in terms of net changes, births, and deaths of establishments. The Net Change values, determined by 
subtracting total firm deaths from total firm births during the one-year time period, indicate the total gains or 
losses during the time period. Comparing the net change in the construction industry to the U.S. total 
demonstrates that this industry does not always follow the same pattern as the national economy. Though the 
construction industry has generally experienced growth of establishments and employment over this period, the 
industry has shown more variability than the total economy.

2.3.3 Value of Construction by C&D Industry Segment 
Figure 2-5 through Figure 2-7 report the value of construction in key industry segments – Total Construction, 
Private Construction, and Public Construction – from 1990 to 2007. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 2: Economic Profile 
2-12 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
As shown in Figure 2-5, the industry generally experienced stable growth from 1990 through 2000. More 
recently, the value of total construction from 2005 to 2006 grew slightly, from $1.16 trillion to $1.19 trillion 
($2006), an increase of 2.1 percent. However, the value of total construction from 2006 to 2007 decreased 
approximately 5 percent. The Private Construction segment is considerably larger than the Public Construction 
segment, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total value of construction in recent years and most of 
the growth. Thus, the private construction sector generally determines the status of the construction industry. 
Within the Private Construction segment (see Figure 2-6, following page), the Private Residential segment 
showed the most growth over the analysis period and generally grew consistently from 1990 to the present. The 
turndown of 3.1 percent in 2006 marks the beginning of the recent weakness in this industry segment. The 
turndown of 18.1 percent in 2007 demonstrates the continued weakness. Private Non-Residential construction 
grew less over this period and shows more variability in total value of activity by year. Overall, reflecting the 
turndown in the Residential Segment, the total value of Private Construction increased by only 1.2 percent from 
2005 to 2006 and decreased by 8.9 percent from 2006 to 2007. 
The Public Construction segment has also grown substantially since 1990 (see Figure 2-7: Annual Value of 
Public Construction from 1990 to 2006 ($2006 Dollars). And overall, the Public Construction segment shows less 
volatility than the Private Construction segment. Over this period, only the Non-Residential segment recorded a 
material decline, during the period 2002-2004. The total value of public construction increased by 5.6 percent 
from 2005 to 2006, and increased by 9.6 percent from 2006 to 2007.

2.4 Industry Characteristics 
The following section defines and describes the construction industry based on establishment and firm-level data. 
Based on data from the most recent Economic Census (2002), the industry includes 178,835 establishments, 
2,573,215 employees, and has approximately $678 billion in value. In addition, the industry is dominated by small 
businesses, with approximately 93% of establishments, 45% of employees, and 31% of value in the industry being 
in single-establishment firms that would be classified as a small business according to Small Business 
Administration business size criteria. 
EPA used two steps to define the number of C&D establishments that could be affected by the various options 
that EPA considered for the C&D regulation. First, EPA identified all C&D establishments using data from the 
2002 Economic Census (see Table 2-1). Second, EPA estimated the number of these establishments that will be 
affected by this action. Section 2.4.1 examines industry-wide characteristics, including the number and size of 
establishments. Section 2.4.2 examines employment and payroll data for the industry. Section 2.4.3 describes 
firm-level data for the C&D industry. Section 2.4.4 presents the number of small entities.  
2.4.1 Establishment-Level Data 
This section presents data for all establishments within the C&D industry as defined in Section 2.1, based 
primarily on the 2002 Economic Census. Data presented include the number, size, value of construction, 
employment, legal form of organization, seasonality, payroll and benefits, and level of specialization of 
establishments, by principal industry sector. 
2.4.1.1 Total Number of Establishments 
Economic Census indicates that the C&D industry had a total of 178,835 establishments with payrolls in 2002 
(i.e., 2002 NAICS 236, 237, see Table 2-3, Table 2-4, and Table 2-5). Of these establishments, the largest 
numbers are in NAICS 236 (Construction of Buildings). This subsector includes 128,897 establishments, 
representing 72.7 percent of all C&D industry establishments. Within NAICS 236, three categories fall in 
Residential Home Construction: 1) New Single-Family General Contractors (NAICS 236115), 2) New 
Multifamily General Contractors (NAICS 236116), and 3) New Housing Operative Builders (NAICS 236117). 
These three categories account for the majority of C&D industry establishments: 88,912 out of 128,897 or 69 
percent. Also within NAICS 236 are two categories of Non-Residential Building Construction: 1) Industrial 
Building Construction (NAICS 236210) and 2) Commercial and Institutional Building Construction (NAICS 
236220). Non-residential construction accounts for the other 31 percent (39,985 establishments) within NAICS 
236 (Construction of Buildings). 
The other segments of the C&D industry include establishments in Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction 
(NAICS 237). Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction accounts for 49,938 establishments, or 27.92 percent of 
the total C&D industry. Within NAICS 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), Land Subdivision 
(NAICS 2372) accounts for 8,403 establishments, or 4.7 percent of all establishments in the C&D industry. Of the 
remaining heavy and civil engineering construction establishments, 22.5 percent (11,239 establishments) are 
primarily Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction contractors, while 39.6 percent (19,794 establishments) are 
contractors that work on Water, Sewer, Pipeline, Communications, and Power Line projects and 21.0 percent 
(10,502 establishments) are engaged in Other Types of Heavy Construction.

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 2-15 
In addition to the establishments with payrolls, a large number of establishments – 531,952 in 20026 – reported no 
paid employees and are not included in the totals in the following tables. These establishments are nonemployers, 
typically self-employed individuals, which are not subject to payroll tax. Available data suggest these 
establishments are very small relative to establishments with payrolls. While employer establishments in NAICS 
236 and 237 had $723.3 billion in receipts for 2002, non-employer establishments had only $46.9 billion in 
receipts, which represents only 6.5 percent of the receipts of employee establishments.

6  This figure includes establishments in NAICS 236 and 237. Data on non-employer establishments was not broken out at the 6 digit 
NAICS level, thus, residential remodelers are included in this figure.

2.4.1.2 Number of Establishments, Employees, and the Value of Construction by Establishment Employee Size 
As viewed in a number of data frameworks, C&D industry groups are dominated by small establishments.7 Table 2-6 through Table 2-8 shows the 
number of establishments, employees, and the value of construction by the establishment’s employee size. Table 2-9 through Table 2-11 shows the 
number of establishments, employees, and the value of construction by the establishment’s value of business size.  
As shown in Table 2-6, the Economic Census reports that 55.1 percent of establishments with payrolls have fewer than 5 employees, 75.0 percent have 
fewer than 10 employees, and 95.3 percent have fewer than 50 employees.8 Overall, less than 0.2 percent of C&D establishments with payrolls have 500 
or more employees. On average, establishments in NAICS 237 (Heavy Construction) are somewhat larger than those in the other NAICS industry 
groups, with a lower percentage of establishments appearing in each of the smaller establishment size classes.  
                                                     
7  The SBA uses size standards based on either the number of employees or annual revenue to classify firms as small. Qualifying revenue levels differ among NAICS industry groups, 
and, within the C&D industries, there is a range of revenue levels, from $6.5 million for NAICS 237210 (Land Subdivision) to $31.0 million for the majority of industry groups within 
NAICS 236 and 237 (U.S. SBA, 2006). A more detailed review of industry size distribution based on the SBA definitions will be presented as part of the Small Entity Impact Analysis. 
8  531,952 establishments in the C&D industry report no employees.

The total number of employees in establishments (Table 2-7, following page) by employee-size follows a similar trend by sector. Again, heavy 
construction stands out as having many more employees within the establishments employing over 100 people (54.3%). As expected, a much smaller 
fraction of total employees are within the category of establishments with fewer than 5 employees. Within this category, the percentage of total 
establishments is nearly 7 times greater than the percentage of total employees.

Table 2-8 reports the value of construction by establishment size. The value of construction, by establishment size, correlates closely with employment 
by establishment size. Again, a larger relative share of total business value occurs in the larger employment size categories.

2.4.1.3 Number of Establishments, Employees, and the Value of Construction by Establishment Revenue Size 
The dominance of small establishments in the C&D industry is also apparent when analyzed on the basis of revenue size class. In 2002, 27.4 percent of 
establishments with payrolls had annual revenue below $250,000, 44.8 percent had annual revenue below $500,000, 61.6 percent had annual revenue 
below $1.0 million, 88.0 percent had annual revenue below $5.0 million, and 93.6 percent had annual revenue below $10 million. These data are shown 
in Table 2-9, following page. Only 11,463 establishments, representing 6.4 percent of the total, had annual revenue in excess of $10.0 million.

As shown in Table 2-11, the total value of construction by establishment revenue class follows the same profile as seen in the previous tables, with a very 
high percentage of total construction value occurring in the higher revenue class establishments. Over half of the total value of annual revenue in the 
C&D sectors is generated in establishments with at least $10 million, although these establishments represent fewer than 7 percent of total establishments 
in this industry.

Legal Form of Organization 
The Economic Census also reports construction establishments according to how they are organized legally, using the following classification scheme: 
(a) corporations, (b) proprietorships, (c) partnerships, and (d) other. In 2002, of establishments with payrolls, a total of 130,253(72.8 percent of the total, 
only of establishments with payrolls – as distinguished from total establishments) were organized as corporations (see Table 2-12). A further 33,184 
(18.5 percent) were organized as proprietorships, while 13,642 (7.6 percent) operated as partnerships and 1,838 (1.0 percent) operated under some other 
legal form of organization.

2.4.1.4 Specialization 
A construction establishment is classified within a type of construction according to the percentage of the 
construction work performed by that establishment. When 51 percent or more of the construction work done by 
the establishment falls within a specific type of construction, the establishment is considered specialized. 
Specialization data provide insight into the percentage of firms that perform work outside their firm’s 
classification. Establishments report their degree of specialization to the Economic Census, based on the 
percentage of revenue earned from each type of construction work. For example, approximately 44.1 percent of 
establishments within NAICS 236115 (New Single-Family Housing Construction) perform 100 percent of their 
work within New Single-Family Housing Construction, 8.1 percent perform 80-99 percent of their work within 
New Single-Family Housing Construction, and 6.6 percent perform 51-79 percent of their work within New 
Single-Family Housing Construction. 
As is the case with two other NAICS divisions (236117 and 236118), a large percentage of the establishments 
within New Single-Family Housing Construction did not report their degree of specialization. This could mean 
that this information was simply not provided to the Census or that these establishments in this sector often do not 
perform 51 percent or more of their work within one specified type of construction. Regardless, within every type 
of construction, most establishments reported that they were 51 percent or more specialized within the specified 
type of construction. 
Since most establishments in any of the relevant segments reported that they were 51 percent or more specialized, 
for the economic analyses presented later in this document, it is reasonable to establish model firms according to 
the assumption that these firms perform all or nearly all business within their classified category. Thus, the 
assumption is made that these firms perform 100 percent of their business within their classified category. To the 
extent that a firm performs work in other types of construction that would not be affected by the regulation (such 
as those classified as New Single-Family Housing Contractors that also perform work as Residential Remodelers), 
the assignment of compliance costs to all business performed by the firm may overstate the potential impact of 
the regulation on firms in those segments as part of the firm- and industry-level impact assessment.

2.4.2 Employment and Payroll 
The construction industry employs a substantial percentage of the total U.S. workforce. With approximately 2.6 
million employees in 2002, the construction industry accounts for nearly 2.4 percent of the entire workforce (the 
total amount of employees is nearly 109 million). Total payroll (approximately $98.6 billion) is roughly the same 
percentage of the total U.S. payroll (approximately $3.7 trillion): 2.6 percent.  
2.4.2.1 Total Number of Employees 
In 2002, establishments with payrolls in the C&D industry employed nearly 2.6 million people. Table 2-14 shows 
the distribution of employment by NAICS industry group. Combined, NAICS 236115, 236220, and 237310 
accounts for over 50 percent of total employment. NAICS 236115 (New Single Family Housing Construction) 
accounts for 273,055 employees (10.6 percent of the total), NAICS 236220 (Commercial and Institutional 
Building Construction) accounts for 715,896 employees (27.8 percent of the total), and NAICS 237310 (Highway, 
Street, and Bridge Construction) accounts for 434,714 employees, or 16.9 percent of the total.

Construction is a seasonal activity in many parts of the country, and employment data from the industry reflect 
this fact. Figure 2-8: Seasonal Trends in Employment in the C&D Industry, 2002, following page, shows monthly 
employment data for all NAICS groups in the C&D industry. Total employment of construction workers was 
lowest in March, at 1.67 million, and highest in August at 1.79 million.

2.4.2.2 Payroll and Benefits 
In 2002, the payrolls of all C&D industry groups totaled $98.6 billion. Of this number, $60.5 billion (61.3 
percent) went to construction workers and $38.1 billion (38.7 percent) went to other employees.9 In addition, the 
C&D industry incurred $13.2 billion in legally-required fringe benefit expenditures and $9.1 billion in voluntary 
fringe benefits expenditures, for a total of $22.3 billion in fringe benefits.10 Table 2-15, following page, shows 
detailed data on payrolls and benefits for each of the C&D industry groups.
                                                     
9  Construction workers include all workers, through the working supervisor level, directly engaged in construction operations, such as 
painters, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. Included are journeymen, mechanics, apprentices, laborers, truck drivers and helpers, 
equipment operators, and onsite recordkeepers and security guards. Other employees include employees in executive, purchasing, 
accounting, personnel, professional, technical and routine office functions.

2.4.3 Firm-Level Data 
The SBA Office of Advocacy works with the Census Bureau to produce firm-level data for U.S. industries. 
Currently, data on firms by employment size and receipt size for 2002 are available; as described previously, 
these data are reported in the 1997 NAICS framework. 
The SBA data are based primarily on administrative records and are not directly linked to data collected for the 
Economic Census. As a result, data reported by SBA may differ from that reported by the Economic Census.11 
The SBA data, however, are the only firm-level data available for C&D industry groups, so EPA included them in 
this analysis. These data are important in the firm and industry-level impact analysis and the small entity analysis, 
both of which are focused at the firm, instead of establishment, level.12 
2.4.3.1 Number of Firms, Employees, and Annual Payroll by Employment Size of Firm 
Table 2-16 through Table 2-18 present the number of firms, establishments, employees, and annual payroll totals 
for firms with payroll by employee size in the C&D industry in 2002, as reported by SBA.13 Both the SBA data 
by employees and receipts are for the year 2002 but the NAICS sector classifications are based on the 1997 
framework definitions. SBA did not report 2002 revenue and employment size class data in the 2002 NAICS format. 
Thus, the number of establishments reported here will differ from the number reported in previous tables due to the 
different sources used (see Appendix 2-1). Most notably, residential remodelers were not broken out in the 1997 
NAICS framework. Thus, the number of firms, establishments, employees, and payroll is an overstatement. In the 
2002 Economic Census data, residential remodelers account for 82,750 establishments. 
Table 2-16, following page, presents the number of firms and establishments by employment size. These data 
indicate that nearly all firms operate a single establishment and have fewer than 20 employees. Of the 263,317 
C&D firms listed within Table 2-16, approximately 98.8 percent operate only one establishment. Furthermore, 
91.7 percent have fewer than 20 employees and less than 1 percent of firms have more than 500 employees 
(similar to Table 2-6). In 2002, there were 38,739 firms in heavy construction, which operated 39,949 
establishments. Almost 97 percent of the heavy construction firms operate a single establishment, and 
approximately 80 percent of these firms have fewer than 20 employees. 
                                                     
11  The SBA data, for example, provide estimates of the number of establishments operated by C&D firms. These establishment 
counts, however, do not match those reported in the Economic Census. This inconsistency is partially due to differences in 
coverage (the SBA data include administrative establishments while the Economic Census does not) as well as differences in 
data collection methods. 
12  For clarification, an establishment is defined as “a relatively permanent office or other place of business where the usual business 
activities related to construction are conducted” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). A firm refers to the aggregation of all 
establishments owned by one company; one firm, therefore, could consist of several establishments. 
13  "The data excludes non-employer businesses, thus excluding many self-employed individuals (employment is measured in March, so 
firms starting after March, firms closing before March, and seasonal firms can have zero employment)." (U.S. SBA, 2004)

2.4.3.2 Number of Firms, Employees, and Annual Payroll by Firm Receipt Size 
Table 2-19 through Table 2-21 report 2002 data on the number of firms, establishments, annual payroll, receipts, 
and number of employees based on revenue size class. Again, the SBA data are for the year 2002, but the data are 
reported in the NAICS 1997 framework. Table 2-19, following page, shows SBA data on the number of employer 
firms and establishments, in 2002, based on revenue size class and 1997 NAICS industry groupings. These data 
show again that most segments of the C&D industry are dominated by small firms. Almost three-quarters (70 
percent) of the firms in the target industry sectors reported under $1.0 million in revenue for 2002; 92.6 percent of 
firms reported revenue lower than $5.0 million.

Similar to the data reported by employment size classifications, data by receipt size classifications as shown in 
Table 2-20, shows a higher percentage of employees fall in the firms with the higher revenue classes. Although 70 
percent of the firms fell into the revenue size class of less than $1 million, only 19.6 percent of employees fall in 
this same classification. Approximately 71.9 percent of employees fall in firms with less than $50 million in 
receipts.

Again, compared to the data by employment size classifications, according to Table 2-21, a greater amount of the 
total annual payroll falls within the firms in the larger receipt size classifications. A much smaller percentage of 
total annual payroll, 11.4 percent, falls within those firms with fewer than $1 million in receipts. Most of the 
annual payroll (64.6 percent) is within those firms that have less than $50 million in receipts. As for firms with 
more than $100 million in receipts, 28.3 percent of the total annual payroll falls into this size category.

2.4.4 Number of Small Entities 
EPA used the establishment-level Economic Census data and firm-level data from SBA to estimate the number of 
entities in the C&D industry that are small businesses in accordance with SBA criteria. SBA uses size standards 
based either on number of employees or on annual revenue to define small entities (13 CFR 121). For all of the 
C&D industry groups, SBA’s business size standards are based on annual revenue. The SBA revenue thresholds 
for the C&D industry are, as follows:  
¾ NAICS 236 (Construction of Buildings): $33.5 million 
¾ NAICS 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), except 2372: $33.5 million 
¾ NAICS 2372 (Land Subdivision of NAICS 237): $7.0 million 
The data sources reviewed above do not provide data according to these exact size standards. As a result, the 
number of firms falling within the SBA small business classifications cannot be determined precisely from these 
data sources but must be estimated, using the data-reporting range from each data source that most nearly matches 
the SBA size classifications.  
In using the SBA data, the data-reporting ranges most closely corresponding to the SBA thresholds are as follows:  
¾ NAICS 236: $50 million (Overstates number of small businesses) 
¾ NAICS 237, except 2372: $50 million (Overstates number of small businesses) 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 2: Economic Profile 
2-36 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
¾ NAICS 2372: $5 million (Understates number of small businesses) 
Table 2-22 and Table 2-23 present estimates of the number of entities falling within the SBA small business 
criteria, based, respectively, on SBA firm-level data and on Economic Census establishment-level data. Based on 
the SBA firm-level data, an estimated 260,424 C&D firms, representing approximately 99 percent of all 
businesses in the C&D industry, have revenue below the corresponding SBA thresholds listed above and, 
therefore could qualify as small businesses under SBA definitions. As reported in Table 2-22, this estimate of the 
number of firms qualifying as a small business is likely to be an overestimate, given the relationship between the 
SBA data reporting ranges and the SBA small business criteria. Furthermore, since the SBA data was reported in 
the 1997 NAICS framework, these numbers include residential remodelers, which are not included within the 
Economic Census data presented below. Thus, this number could be overstated by approximately 80,000 firms 
since residential remodelers are not included within the EA. 
As described previously, approximately 99 percent of firms operate only one establishment. Thus, looking at 
the Economic Census data, which are reported for establishments instead of firms, also provides significant 
insight into the presence of small entities in the C&D industry. As expected, given the large percentage of single-
establishment firms in the C&D industry, the 2002 Economic Census and SBA report very nearly the same 
numbers of entities, whether establishments or firms. However, as stated previously, the number of firms within 
the SBA data is overstated due to the inclusion of residential remodelers. In the same way as for the SBA data, 
Economic Census data are not reported in ranges that match precisely the SBA small business criteria values.  
In using the Economic Census data, the data-reporting ranges most closely corresponding to the SBA thresholds 
are as follows:  
¾ NAICS 236: $10 million (Understates number of small businesses) 
¾ NAICS 237, except 2372: $10 million (Understates number of small businesses) 
¾ NAICS 2372: $5 million (Understates number of small businesses) 
Based on the Economic Census establishment-level data, approximately 167,007 C&D establishments, 
representing approximately 93.4 percent of all establishments in the C&D industry, have revenue below the 
corresponding SBA thresholds listed above. Given that nearly all C&D industry firms are single-establishment 
firms, this value, by definition, cannot be substantially different from the number and percentage of small 
business firms. As reported in Table 2-23, this estimate of the number of establishments potentially qualifying as 
a small business is very likely an underestimate, given the relationship between the Economic Census data 
reporting ranges and the SBA small business criteria. 
In reviewing Table 2-22 and Table 2-23, it is important to note that the subsector definitions differ for the two 
tables: the SBA-based data are reported in the 1997 NAICS sector framework; the Economic Census data are 
reported in the 2002 NAICS sector framework. This difference is most evident in the comparison of the total 
establishment and firm data since residential remodelers are not included within the Economic Census data 
presented but are included within the SBA data presented. Residential remodelers account for an additional 82,750 
establishments. The difference is also evident in the comparison of the establishment and firm data for the NAICS 
2372, Land Subdivision, where the reported number of firms, 13,860, is greater than the number of establishments, 
8,403.  
The SBA firm-level data suggests that 99 percent of total C&D industry firms are small firms, while the 
Economic Census data suggests that small firms make-up 93.4 percent of total establishments. As explained 
above, EPA considers the SBA data to slightly overestimate the percentage of small entities and the Census data 
to slightly underestimate the actual percentage. The conclusion that can be made from both estimates is that the 
C&D industry is dominated by small entities. Small firms, as defined according to SBA criteria, very likely 
represent more than 95 percent of all firms in the relevant C&D industry subsectors.

For two of the C&D NAICS subsectors (236 and 237), the upper bound of the related SBA reporting range is below the SBA small business criterion. For 
these subsectors, the indicated small firm counts are almost certainly an overestimate of the number of small firms. For the subsector (2372), the upper 
bound of the reporting range is above the SBA small business criterion. For these subsectors, the indicated small firm counts are almost certainly an 
underestimate of the number of small firms. Given that subsectors 236 and 237 (except 2372) represent over 85 percent of the total of firms in the four 
subsectors, the total of the indicated small firm counts across the four subsectors is more like also an overestimate. 
Note: SBA data and assignments by NAICS subsectors are based on the 1997 NAICS sector definition framework. 
Figures do not necessarily add to totals due to rounding.

Because the upper bound of the Economic Census reporting range is below the SBA small business criterion for all of the C&D subsectors, the indicated 
small establishment counts are almost certainly an underestimate of the number of small establishments, and the total of these values is therefore also likely 
an underestimate. 
Note: Economic Census data and assignments by NAICS subsectors are based on the 2002 NAICS sector definition framework. 
Figures do not necessarily add to totals due to rounding.

2.5 Industry Dynamics and Forecast 
By a number of measures, the C&D industry has historically been a relatively volatile sector, and is subject to 
wider swings of economic performance than the economy as a whole. Although the industry has been on a fairly 
continuous growth trend since 1964, there have been a few interruptions within this upward movement. Within 
the industry, residential construction, as compared to nonresidential and other public construction, has 
experienced the most volatility of business performance.  
From 1991 to 2005, the industry grew fairly continuously. Single-family housing, for example, grew from an 
annual level of 0.8 million housing starts in 1991 to 1.7 million housing starts in 2005, representing an average 
annual growth rate of 5.5 percent. During this same period, real GDP grew by an average of 3.2 percent per year 
(BEA, 2008a). Since 2006, however, the construction industry has experienced a downturn, with the weakness 
occurring most strongly in the residential sector. To provide insight into the cyclicality of the industry compared 
to the economy as a whole, this section presents the annual value of total construction, private construction, public 
construction, and the total number of housing starts indexed to real GDP. The section also highlights housing 
starts and the value of construction for each sector, including forecast data for the construction industry.

2.5.1 Annual Value of Construction and Housing Starts Indexed to Real GDP 
Figure 2-9 (Total Construction), Figure 2-10 (Private Construction), and Figure 2-11 (Public Construction) 
display the annual value of construction, by segment, indexed to 100 in 1964 with GDP for the period 1964-2007 
(all underlying values in constant $2006). Figure 2-12 presents annual housing starts and real GDP, again as 
index series, over the same analysis period. All of these figures demonstrate the greater variability of the 
construction industry compared to the entire economy. Slight declines or slow-downs in the general economy, as 
occurred in 1981/1982, 1991/1992, and 2001/2002, are accompanied by much larger drops in construction 
industry activity (see Figure 2-9, below).

Private residential construction shows considerably greater volatility than the construction industry as a whole. 
Before 1991’s trough, the annual profile of private residential construction varied substantially. Only after 1991 
did private residential construction see a relatively continuous growth trend persisting for a period of more than 
five years. As shown by the steeper curves in Figure 2-10, private residential construction grew more rapidly than 
the economy, as a whole, from the mid 1990s to 2005. However, as previously discussed, this segment entered a 
steep downturn in 2006 and 2007, as shown in Figure 2-10.

Overall, public construction has generally been less volatile, year-to-year, than private construction. However, the 
Housing and Redevelopment segment and the Non-Residential segment have shown greater volatility than the 
Other Public Construction segment and greater volatility than the national economy. All three segments have 
grown at a lower rate than the overall economy, although the Non-Residential segment grew faster than the 
general economy from 1993 to 2003.

2.5.2 Housing Starts: Actual and Forecast 
Annual housing starts, again as an index and compared with real GDP, also illustrates the higher variability within  
the residential construction industry compared to the economy as a whole (see Figure 2-12). This exhibit also 
shows the fairly stable growth trend of housing starts over the past 10-15 years and the corresponding drop in 
housing starts in 2006 and 2007.

Figure 2-13, page 2-44, reports annual housing starts from 1992 to 2004 (in the red, dashed line) and quarterly 
housing starts from 2005 Q1 to 2008 Q2 (in light purple). The quarterly values have been multiplied by four to 
approximate annual equivalents. The substantial fall-off in housing construction beginning in the second quarter 
of 2006 and continuing through 2007 is apparent. One of the main reasons 2007 showed such a substantial decline 
is a speculative run-up in house prices accompanied by a substantial acceleration in new housing supply, which 
was most widespread within single-family housing (Reed, August 2007). As a result, single-family housing has 
declined more substantially than multi-family housing. Standard and Poor’s Industry Outlook for the housing 
construction sector provides a similar assessment: since late 2006, the housing market has experienced a 
downturn after nearly a decade of rising home prices and strong demand. On the other hand, S&P believes that 
during the current housing downturn, some “homebuilders have strengthened their balance sheets by reducing 
debt and boosting cash” (S&P, 2008). In general, S&P forecasts residential construction profits will experience 
further decreases during 2008 before reaching market stability in mid-2009 (S&P, 2008) and achieving supply 
and demand equilibrium in 2010.

Another construction industry business analysis firm, Global Insight, provides further assessments of the 
construction industry (Global Insight, January, March, and October 2008). Due to relatively low interest rates and 
aggressive credit practices, mortgage rates for home purchases remained historically low until recently. However, 
in 2005, housing affordability began to decline with increasing home prices and mortgage lending rates. In 
addition, an increasing volume of home sales were accomplished via non-traditional financing arrangements in 
which interest rates and/or principal payments might be maintained at low levels during the early years of a loan, 
with the expectation of increasing to more traditional structure levels within a few years of loan issuance. As 
interest rates were marked to market and payment obligations increased under these non-traditional mortgages, 
loan payment delinquencies and foreclosures began to increase. These foreclosures added to the excess supply of 
homes on the market. Beginning in mid-2005, new and existing home sales started to fall sharply. However, as 
demonstrated by Figure 2-13, housing starts continued to increase well into the first quarter of 2006, adding to 
the already large inventory of unsold homes. Global Insight assesses that housing starts have farther to fall before 
prices and sales volume in the segment will stabilize and a recovery begin. Recently, Global Insight forecast that 
housing starts are expected to drop below the one million mark, bottoming out at 738,000 units by the second 
quarter of 2009 (Global Insight, October 2008). However, it is not until 2012/2013 that housing starts will reach 
their forecasted average trend of 1.7 million starts (Global Insight, October 2008). 
Although housing starts are expected to return to a positive growth trend during 2009, home prices are not 
expected to return to a positive growth trend until 2010. Nonetheless, Global Insight believes that regardless of 
the current housing weakness, falling home prices coupled with continued long-run demand for housing will 
eventually return the housing market to a sustainable market equilibrium of increased construction and sales of 
new housing (Global Insight, November 2007). Long-run demand factors – household formation, demand for 
second homes, and demolitions – will also support recovery in the residential construction segment. According to 
Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, the number of new homes demanded will increase due to 
demographic factors such as increased immigration and the aging of the echo-boom generation and the longer life 
expectancy of baby-boomers (Joint Center, 2008). Household formation growth is expected to increase to 14.4 
million during 2010-2020, compared to 12.6 million during 1995-2005 (Joint Center, 2008). Demolitions are also 
expected to increase due to the aging housing stock, thus supporting demand for new homes to replace older units. 
In a long-term forecast for the housing construction industry published by the National Association of Home 
Builders (NAHB) in 2006, NAHB forecasted that, on average, annual housing starts in the next ten years will 
exceed those of the previous decade – despite the current weakness of the housing construction industry. The 
NAHB publication forecasts that households trading up for larger homes will cause an upturn from 2010 to 2015 
(NAHB, 2006).

Table 2-24 reports the number of actual housing starts for 2003 through 2007, and forecasted starts by Global Insight, Reed Construction, and Mortgage 
Bankers Association (MBA) for 2008 through 2012 (Reed’s projections are only until 2009 and MBA’s projections are only until 2010). The 12.9 
percent decrease from 2005 to 2006 reflects the beginning of the decline in housing starts after the 2005 peak and the 24.8 percent decrease in housing 
starts from 2006-2007 demonstrates the continued decline. Reed’s September forecast, Global Insight’s January forecast, and MBA’s September forecast 
show a continuation of this trend through 2008, with housing starts projected to decrease by 25.7 percent (Reed), 23.7 percent (Global Insight), and 28.6 
percent (MBA). Housing starts for 2009 were projected to recover after bottoming in 2008 (although possibly still experiencing negative growth rates 
into the beginning of 2009). Due to the current economic situation, however, Global Insight’s October 2008 forecast projects an even greater percentage 
decline of 29.8% from 2007 to 2008 and expects housing starts to bottom out in late 2009 at approximately 740,000 units. According to Global Insight’s 
October forecast, the approximately 38 percent increase from 2009 to 2010 will spur the recovery well into 2012/2013 when housing starts are expected 
to return to their long term trend of approximately 1.7 million starts.

2.5.3 Value of Construction by C&D Industry Segment: Actual and Forecasts 
Residential construction, as illustrated in Figure 2-13 and Table 2-24, has experienced a clear decline in housing starts since early 2006. Moreover, this 
weakness may remain for several quarters before a recovery (Global Insight, September 2007). Throughout 2006 and 2007, while residential construction 
was experiencing housing start declines and negative growth, non-residential construction somewhat offset this weakness. Table 2-25 lists the value of 
construction in constant 2008 dollars, by sector, for previous years (from the BEA) and for forecasted years (from Global Insight). As shown in the table, 
residential construction reported a relatively large decrease in construction value (-17.5 percent) from 2006 to 2007. At the same time, non-residential 
construction reported a relatively large increase in construction value (12.6 percent) from 2006 to 2007. Looking to the future, for 2009, Global Insight 
projected (in their January 2008 forecast) a return to growth for the residential segment (5.5 percent) but projects weakness in the non-residential 
segment (-5.9 percent). Still, within this forecast, Global Insight projects modest growth for the construction industry overall in 2009 (0.5 percent) and, 
beyond 2009, expects the overall industry to perform more favorably with projected total growth of 5.1 percent in 2010 and 5.7 percent in 2011, before 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 2: Economic Profile 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 2-46 
returning to a more sustainable real growth (i.e., in dollar values adjusted for inflation) of 2.5 percent, overall, in 2012 (Global Insight, January 2008). 
However, these forecasts were projected before the recent economic downturn; therefore, in Global Insight’s more recent October 2008 forecast, the 
industry is expected to witness further declines for both the residential, non-residential, and non-building sectors. Housing starts, a good indicator of the 
strength of the residential sector, are expected to hit bottom in mid to late 2009 and gradually improve thereafter. Non-residential spending, which often 
lags behind the pattern in the residential sector, is expected to see declines in private non-residential building through late 2008 into the first quarter of 
2010. Furthermore, the non-building sector (i.e., publicly-funded projects), is expected to see further declines due to the flattening or decline in 
government revenue.  In short, though the industry is expected to experience declines over the next couple years, the industry is expected to achieve 
positive business performance over the longer-term and beginning around 2010/2011.

Reed Construction, a commercial construction industry data service that collects and reports information on multifamily, commercial/institutional, and 
industrial construction projects undertaken nationally, projected in their September 2008 forecast that the residential sector will begin recovery in 2009, 
with some regional markets experiencing increases before others. Overall, Reed Construction projects that residential construction will see an increase in 
activity of nearly 8 percent from 2008 to 2009 (Reed Construction, September 2008a). 
Table 2-26, below, lists year-to-year forecasts (from January 2008) for non-residential construction during the periods 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. 
Overall, the average consensus among these forecasts was a 0.57 percent increase for 2007/2008 and a 1.03 percent decrease for 2008/2009, which is 
somewhat more pessimistic than the January 2008 Global Insight forecast for this segment, as presented above. However, this information does not 
represent the economic events that have occurred recently; therefore, the forecast below may be optimistic.

2.5.4 Overall Outlook 
Overall, the construction industry is expected to experience continuing weakness until residential markets work through the current inventory of unsold 
homes, and credit markets and the general economy return to a better condition. Recent forecasts (Global Insight, October 2008) suggest that the industry 
will experience further declines before returning to better performance.  
Currently, the C&D rule is scheduled to be promulgated during 2009. However, EPA anticipates that the rule’s requirements will become practically 
effective over the timeframe of 2009 and 2013, as states incorporate the rule’s requirements into their construction general permit as they come up for 
renewal.14 Given the above construction industry outlook and the reality that the rule’s requirements will not be immediately applicable throughout the 
country, EPA expects the industry will be on the way to achieving a sufficient recovery during the period when the rule becomes fully implemented, to 
absorb the rule’s requirements without undue adverse effect.
                                                     
14 Under the NPDES program, authorized states renew their general permits every five years.

Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-1 
3 Economic Impact Analysis Methodology 
3.1 Overview of the Economic Impact Analysis Methodology 
EPA is developing new effluent limitation guidelines applicable to stormwater discharges from new construction 
and land development activities. Effluent guidelines are technology-based national regulations that control the 
discharge of pollutants to surface waters and to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). This chapter presents 
EPA’s methodology for analyzing the economic impacts of the proposed regulatory options covering the C&D 
industry. EPA has employed a number of different methods for assessing the economic impacts of these options 
on C&D businesses and consumers of construction industry output at the project-level, firm-level, industry-level, 
and national-level. 
This EA assesses the overall cost and impact of three options for the C&D effluent limitation guidelines 
regulation: 
¾ Option 1 would establish minimum sizing criteria for sediment basins used at construction sites with 10 
or more disturbed acres draining to one location. Under this option, permittees would be required to 
install sediment basins that provide either 3,600 cubic feet per acre of runoff storage, or be designed to 
store runoff from the local 2-year, 24-hour storm event, whichever is less expensive. This option also 
includes requirement for implementing a variety of erosion and sediment controls on all construction sites 
that are required to obtain a permit (e.g., larger than one acre). 
¾ Option 2 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, and in addition, requires construction sites of 
30 or more acres to meet a numeric turbidity limit in stormwater discharges from the site. The numeric 
turbidity standard would be applicable to stormwater discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-
year, 24-hour event. The turbidity standard would only apply to construction sites located in areas where 
the rainfall runoff erosivity factor (R-factor) as defined in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 
(RUSLE) is greater than or equal to 50 and if the soils on the site contain 10% or more by mass of soil 
particles smaller than 2 microns in diameter. 
¾ Option 3 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, and in addition, requires all sites with 10 or 
more acres of disturbed land to meet a numeric turbidity standard. Unlike Option 2, the turbidity standard 
would apply to all sites, regardless of soil types or R-factor. The turbidity standard would apply to all 
stormwater discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-year, 24-hour event. 
This overview section summarizes some of the key underlying concepts and assumptions EPA has used to develop 
and implement the economic analysis methodology, including the regulatory baseline and the mechanisms by which 
the proposed rule may affect the C&D industry. The last sub-section in this overview (3.1.3) summarizes the 
various methodologies developed for this EA and how the rest of the chapter is organized. 
3.1.1 The Regulatory Baseline 
EPA’s standard practice in developing regulatory baselines is to assume full compliance with all existing state and 
federal regulations that affect the entities in the analysis. For the economic analysis, EPA assumes that affected 
C&D markets have fully implemented the existing Phase I and II stormwater regulations and any state-level 
requirements. EPA also assumes that industry will be in 100 percent compliance following promulgation of the 
proposed rule. These criteria define the general regulatory baseline criteria for this economic analysis.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-2 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
In addition to these general regulatory baseline conditions, EPA has established detailed information that 
describes the nature, composition, and quantity of baseline industry activity against which the regulation’s 
incremental effects will be measured. The overall baseline specifications are detailed in Chapter 4 – Developing 
the Analysis Baseline, which estimates key baselines metrics describing the C&D industry, model construction 
firms, and developed acreage that underlie the analysis of the regulatory options. The baseline metrics are 
developed by using information from the industry profile (Chapter 2) and analysis approaches outlined in this 
chapter. Please refer to Chapter 4 for the results of the baseline analysis. 
3.1.2 Mechanisms by which C&D Markets May be Affected by the Proposed Rule 
Some of the mechanisms by which a C&D industry regulation can potentially affect product markets and, as a 
result, induce impacts of concern in the analysis of a C&D industry regulation include: 
1. Regulatory requirements may increase construction costs and lengthen project construction periods, 
which further increases total project costs. Increased project costs may in turn adversely affect the 
financial performance of construction projects and the firms that undertake these projects and/or increase 
the prices paid by consumers of C&D industry output. Increased prices will increase sale prices or rents of 
completed projects. The extent to which increased construction costs manifest as higher sales prices and 
rents will depend on supply and demand elasticities in specific construction product markets. These 
elasticities may vary substantially both over time, across regional markets, and within regional markets 
according to supply and demand conditions in specific product segments.  
2. Consumers’ response to increased project prices can affect the overall bundle of characteristics (e.g., 
size, technical design and finished product specifications) that determine consumers’ value of, and price 
paid for, the finished real estate product. Faced with increased construction costs and potential price 
increases for a finished product, consumers (and project developers as their surrogate) may select lower 
cost specifications on other aspects of final project design. The flexibility to adjust project design 
specifications can buffer consumers from the construction cost increase and upward price pressure 
resulting from regulatory requirements, but may also result in trade-offs of valuable attributes. Such 
flexibility is particularly important if the potential construction cost and price increases are substantial and 
consumers faced income-based constraints on the price (or rent) that may be paid for the finished product. 
3. If producers are unable to pass all increased costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, this 
could lead to weakened financial performance of, and lower employment among, C&D industry 
businesses. Affected businesses may lose business value and could face financial stress, leading 
potentially to reductions in business activity and, in the worst case, closure of individual businesses. 
Given the relative fluidity of the C&D industry sectors expected to be affected by this regulation, idled 
economic resources – i.e., labor and capital – might be redeployed relatively quickly into other existing 
C&D industry businesses or new industry entrants. Regional and temporal variation in market response to 
increased construction costs and potential price effects may lead to substantial variation in the extent and 
character of impacts within the C&D industry.  
4. Increased project costs and associated pressure on project prices for new finished product may spill over 
into price effects – as increased sales prices or rents, in the present and in the future – for existing 
finished product or new product not subject to the regulation’s requirements.  
5. Conversely, the presence of existing finished product and new product not impacted by the rule serves as 
competition for newly constructed finished product and can thus limit the potential for upward pricing 
pressure on finished product subject to the regulation’s requirements. The presence of existing finished 
product provides a buffer against price and rent increases to C&D industry product consumers.

6. Regulatory requirements may change the expected profitability (economic rent) of undeveloped land. 
Overall, the change in expected profitability is negative with undeveloped property becoming less 
valuable because of regulatory requirements. As this reduced value is capitalized into prices for 
undeveloped property, the reduction in value of undeveloped property can become an offset to an increase 
in project costs and buffer the project developer/construction firm and/or consumers from the 
economic/financial effects of regulatory requirements. 
7. These effects will vary by property depending on the compliance requirements that would apply to 
properties of given physical characteristics. On a relative basis, some undeveloped properties will 
become less valuable as a result of a regulation while others could become more valuable. The differential 
changes in economic rent and value of undeveloped properties may also cause shifts in the ordering and 
timing of project development. On the margin, the economically desirable time for project development 
will be delayed for some properties while being accelerated for other properties. For example, in a given 
local market, all else equal, the development of in-scope undeveloped property may be delayed while the 
development of out-of-scope undeveloped property may be accelerated. 
8. All of these regulatory response effects – increased construction costs from regulation compliance; 
distribution of compliance costs among owners of undeveloped property, construction businesses, and 
consumers; changes in the characteristics of C&D industry finished product; and potential effects on the 
timing and configuration of property development – reflect the internalization of construction-related 
costs to society that are currently not accounted for in the private transactions of property purchase, 
development, and sale/rent. These cost and price effects, and the decision responses by property owners, 
producers and consumers, are indicative of the correction of production costs and market prices to 
account for the costs to society that were previously unaccounted for in the various affected transactions. 
Of these effect mechanisms, EPA considers items 1, 2, 3, and 7 to be of most importance in causing a material 
regulatory impact. Of these, items 1, 2, and 3 are able to be addressed in this cost and economic impact analysis. 
3.1.3 Summary of Economic Impact Analysis Models and Organization 
This section provides a summary of the analysis methodologies developed for the EA and how the rest of the 
chapter is organized: 
¾ Section 3.2 – Analysis of Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts. Assessment of compliance costs 
and economic impacts for model C&D projects. The purpose of the model building project analysis 
framework is to develop the incremental compliance cost multipliers that are used to incorporate 
overhead, debt, and equity cost considerations into the per-acre engineering compliance cost estimates in 
subsequent analyses outlined in this document. 
¾ Section 3.3 – Analysis of Firm- and Industry-Level Economic Impacts. Assessment of the cost and 
economic/financial impact of regulatory requirements on C&D industry firms, and the potential industry-
level effects in terms of numbers of firms that may be adversely affected, potential employment at risk, 
and total costs to the C&D industry for regulation compliance. 
¾ Section 3.4 – Analysis of Single-Family Housing Affordability Impacts. A MSA-level assessment of 
housing affordability, where impacts are measured in terms of the expected change in price for median- 
and lower-quartile priced new single-family homes and the associated number of prospective home 
buyers that may experience an affordability effect due to the price change. 
¾ Section 3.5 – Analysis of Social Cost. A state-level assessment of partial equilibrium market effects in 
the C&D industry building sectors is used to adjust the initial firm-level estimate of total resource cost of 
compliance to account for the potential reduction in C&D industry output. The analysis also estimates the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-4 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
overall deadweight welfare loss to society arising from the change in each market’s output level. The 
quantity-effect-adjusted resource cost of compliance and the total deadweight loss comprise two 
components of the total social cost of the proposed rule. 
¾ Section 3.6 – Analysis of Economy-Wide Economic Effects. An input-output multiplier analysis that 
considers total economy effects – in terms of output and employment – based on the total change in 
demand for society’s resources arising from (1) compliance outlays, and (2) the reduction in C&D 
industry output. The analysis also estimates the net change in demand for society’s resources arising from 
these two effect mechanisms.  
¾ Section 3.7 – Future Projections of Compliance Cost and Acreage. Analysis that projects forward the 
estimated social cost and quantity of compliance acreage to more accurately reflect the industry’s 
anticipated activity level during 2009, when the rule compliance begins, and out to the year 2025. This 
analysis accounts for the expected phase-in of compliance cost over the first five years after promulgation 
as states renew their Construction General Permits (different states renew their permits in different years). 
¾ Section 3.8 – Key Sources of Uncertainty and Limitations. This section compiles and highlights the key 
sources of uncertainty and key limitations described throughout the methodology chapter. 
3.2 Analysis of Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts 
EPA has analyzed the impacts of the proposed regulatory options on financial models of representative C&D 
projects. The primary purpose of the model project analysis is to determine, for each C&D sector, a compliance 
cost “multiplier” that captures the debt and equity cost considerations that firms will incur in performing 
compliance activities, which are not captured in the engineering estimate of compliance cost per acre. The 
incremental compliance cost multiplier effect is employed in subsequent sections (3.4 and 3.5) of the economic 
analysis to adjust the incremental compliance cost to a value that more fully reflects the true social resource cost 
of compliance. 
The project models are based on EPA’s best available data and assumptions concerning construction project 
characteristics. They are designed to depict the change in cash flow resulting from compliance with the proposed 
options for typical projects, representative of the type required to comply with the proposed rule, and the rule’s 
potential impact on project price, given pricing conventions typically employed by the construction industry. 
3.2.1 Description of the Project-Level Analysis Model Structure 
EPA developed economic models for four types of building development projects that reflect the range of 
building projects undertaken by the industry and fall within the scope of the proposed rule. For each class of 
project, EPA developed an economic model that corresponds to a typical 1-acre size project. These projects 
include: 
¾ A single-family residential development 
¾ A multi-family residential development 
¾ A commercial development 
¾ An industrial development 
The model project analysis frameworks account for the timing of outlays and financing for land purchase, 
development, and construction, as well as the timing for incurring compliance outlays and the ultimate sale of the 
model construction project. EPA then calculated the discounted present value of project outlays; effectively 
collapsing the time-explicit framework into a single-period equivalent analysis. The 1-acre model projects are 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-5 
assumed to be linearly scalable to other acreage sizes as needed to capture the cash flow, present value and return 
effects of regulatory requirements. 
The model project analysis frameworks account for the financing costs associated with project-level outlays using 
pre-tax costs of debt and equity capital parameters of 7.0% and 13.54%, respectively. These cost of debt and 
equity parameters were developed using the methodology described in Section 3.3.2.2.  
The location of each model project is unspecified and, for this reason, EPA used national-level data wherever 
possible. Also, EPA assumes that model project sites are controlled by a developer-builder (sometimes referred to 
in the industry as a merchant builder or operative builder). The developer-builder is responsible for all aspects of a 
project, from land acquisition through permitting, subdivision of the parcel, installation of any stormwater 
controls and construction and marketing of completed unit(s). EPA recognizes that there are many variations on 
how a particular site is developed, but believes this model is generally representative of a large number of the 
projects undertaken each year in the United States.15 In effect, this assumption focuses the project-level impacts of 
the action on a single business entity. 
EPA assumes that all model projects follow a similar development process, consisting of three phases: 
¾ Land acquisition – The developer-builder puts together the necessary financing to purchase the parcel. 
When lenders are involved, they may require documentation, such as financial statements, tax returns, 
appraisals, proof of the developer’s ability to obtain necessary zoning, evaluations of project location, 
assessments of the capacity of existing infrastructure, letters of intent from the city/town to install 
infrastructure, and environmental approvals. To satisfy these factors, the developer might incur costs 
associated with compiling this data. 
¾ Land development – The developer-builder obtains all necessary site approvals and prepares the site for 
the construction phase of the project. Costs incurred during this phase include so-called “soft” costs for 
architectural and engineering services, legal work, permits, fees, and testing; and “hard” costs, such as 
land clearing, installing utilities and roads, and preparing foundations or pads. The result of this phase is a 
legally subdivided parcel with finished lots ready for construction. 
¾ Construction – The developer-builder undertakes the actual construction during this phase. A substantial 
portion of this work could be subcontracted to specialty subcontractors (e.g., foundation, framing, 
roofing, plumbing, electrical, and painting subcontractors). 
Because the length of each project phase and the timing of an actual sale can vary substantially – both within and 
across projects that occur in these construction sectors – EPA believes it is reasonable to assume that each model 
project could follow a similar development process in terms of project phases and their timing. EPA’s data 
sources and assumptions regarding the timing of each project phase and the various cost elements incurred during 
the different phases of development are described in Section 3.2.2. 
3.2.2 Inputs to the Baseline Model C&D Projects 
The baseline financial conditions for the model projects describe the model projects in terms of cash operating 
events from project start to sale, and in terms of financing structure and financial position, on a pre-tax basis. 
Model projects are characterized in the baseline by physical and technical parameters (e.g., project total acreage, 
size and number of construction products associated with the project, acreage disturbed) as well as financial 
parameters (e.g., types, timing, and magnitude of costs incurred during various phases of the project, and the 
                                                     
15  Other common scenarios involve the developer selling all or some of the finished lot(s) to builders. The developer will not necessarily 
retain lot(s) in a development to complete and sell.

sources for these funds in terms of the amounts borrowed versus the amounts provided from the developer-
builder’s equity). 
The general cost categories included during the various stages of each model project – independent of compliance 
outlays – are summarized in the following table.

3.2.2.1 Phase 1 – Land Acquisition 
The first phase of each model project is land acquisition, which includes the purchase of raw land for the project. 
Residential Building Projects 
The model single-family residential project is assumed to be an undeveloped parcel zoned for single-family 
residential housing. The model multi-family residential project is assumed to be an apartment building or 
complex. The cost of raw land per acre for single- and multi-family development is estimated from the National 
Association of Home Builder’s (NAHB) 2007 National Results - Construction Costs for a Single-Family Unit. 
NAHB’s annual report includes “average” costs for the development and construction of a single-family housing 
unit using information compiled from builders in approximately 50 metropolitan markets. 
NAHB’s 2007 single-family unit cost report indicates a raw lot cost of $45,507, where a new single-family lot as 
defined by the Census is 16,968 square feet in size. Using this information, EPA estimated the cost of a full acre 
of raw land is $116,887 (43,560 sq ft. per acre divided by 16,959 sq. ft per lot – or, 2.57 – multiplied by the per-
lot land cost of $45,507). 
EPA assumed that the land acquisition cost is financed over a time period equal to the total length of the project – 
from land acquisition through development, construction, and sale. EPA assumes the single-family and multi-
family model projects each take four years – that is, revenue from the sale of the housing unit(s) occurs four years 
after initiation of the land acquisition loan. Part of the land acquisition loan is financed through debt (with debt 
cost of 7.0%) and part is financed using developer equity (with a 13.54% equity cost) assuming a land acquisition 
loan-to-value ratio of 65%, which is based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules for land acquisition.

Non-Residential Building Projects 
The model commercial building project is assumed to be an enclosed retail shopping or office area. The model 
industrial building project is assumed to be an industrial park or stand-alone manufacturing facility. As with the 
residential projects, a single developer-builder is assumed to be responsible for site acquisition, site preparation, 
construction, and marketing of each project.  
The cost of raw land per acre for commercial and industrial development is based on the Urban Land Institute’s 
(ULI) Market Profiles 2000: North America report. The median land cost per acre, inflated to 2007 dollars using 
BEA’s GDP deflator, for retail shopping centers as reported in ULI’s report is $358,667, and the median land cost 
per acre for industrial parks is $165,745. 
EPA assumed the land acquisition cost is financed over a time period equal to the total length of the projects – 
from land acquisition through development, construction, and sale. The project timeline for commercial and 
industrial projects is assumed to be four years from start to finish. Part of the land acquisition loan is financed 
through debt and part is financed using developer equity assuming a land acquisition loan-to-value ratio of 65%, 
based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules for land acquisition. 
3.2.2.2 Phase 2 – Land Development 
Residential Building Projects 
NAHB’s 2007 National Results - Construction Costs for a Single-Family Unit is the data source used by EPA to 
establish the baseline land development costs for the model residential construction projects. NAHB reports 
specific line item costs for land development, which EPA grouped into five categories: 
1. Land development (e.g., site preparation, site improvement – paving, water and sewer, erosion and 
sediment – water and electric hook-up); 
2. Impact fees and analysis; 
3. Other fees (e.g., cost of processing approvals, land dedication or fee in lieu, bonding/escrow fee); 
4. Land preservation and planting costs (e.g., tree and wetland preservation and planting; value of land left 
as green space or park); and, 
5. Other costs. 
NAHB reports each cost element on a per-single-family-lot basis. EPA converted these per-lot costs to a per-acre 
basis for the multi-family and non-residential model project frameworks using the same assumption – 2.57 single-
family lots per acre – used to convert NAHB’s raw lot cost to a per-acre basis in the previous section. EPA 
assumed, based on the NAHB data, that overhead costs are 10% of total baseline land development costs for each 
residential construction project. 
EPA assumed the loan to finance the land development costs is initiated one year following the initiation of the 
land acquisition loan and continues until the project is completed. Therefore, the land development loans for 
single- and multi-family model projects have durations of three years. Part of the land development loan is 
assumed to be financed through debt and part is financed using developer equity assuming a land development 
loan-to-value ratio of 75%, based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules for land development. 
Non-Residential Building Projects 
To establish baseline land development costs for the model commercial and industrial projects, EPA used the 
same per-acre cost elements that are used in the multi-family project framework, which in turn, are originally 
derived from the single-family framework, as outlined above. EPA similarly maintained the assumption that 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-8 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
overhead costs are 10% of total baseline land development costs for the commercial and industrial construction 
projects. 
EPA assumed the loan to finance the land development costs is initiated one year following the initiation of the 
land acquisition loan and continues until the project is completed. Therefore, the land development loan for a 
commercial or industrial model project is three years in duration. Part of the land development loan is assumed to 
be financed through debt and part is financed using developer equity assuming a land development loan-to-value 
ratio of 75%, which is based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules for land development. 
3.2.2.3 Phase 3 – Building Construction 
The third phase of each model project is construction, which includes the physical structures as well as costs for 
other site infrastructure such as paving and sidewalk construction. Specification of baseline costs during the first 
two phases of each model project is driven exclusively by the overall size (in acres) of the model project. Costs 
incurred during the construction phase are driven primarily by the number, size, and orientation (i.e. proximity of 
units to each other and to street network) of unit(s) – in terms of the number of units per building, floors per 
building, number of buildings, and ratio of project size to building footprint(s) – constructed on the developed 
land. For the multi-family and non-residential building construction projects, EPA developed specific 
characterizations of the number, size, and orientation of unit(s) in a typical 1-acre project based actual project data 
compiled from Reed Construction. This data improves the project-level construction cost estimates and improves 
the estimation of the project compliance cost multipliers that are later incorporated into the partial equilibrium 
analysis framework. 
Residential Building Projects 
NAHB’s 2007 National Results - Construction Costs for a Single-Family Unit and the U.S. Census 
Characteristics of New Housing are the data sources used by EPA to establish the baseline construction costs for 
the model single-family residential construction project. The U.S. Census Characteristics of New Housing data 
indicates the 2006 national average lot size for a single-family home is approximately 0.39 acres, and that the 
average size of a single-family home built on that lot is 2,456 square feet. This implies 2.57 single-family units 
(or 6,311 square feet of construction) per acre. NAHB reports the total construction cost for an average single-
family unit is $65.57/square foot. 
Reed Construction project data and R.S. Means are the primary data sources used by EPA to establish the baseline 
construction costs for the model multi-family residential construction project. Reed Construction indicates that, on 
average, a 1-acre multi-family construction project consists of approximately 60,000 total square feet of 
constructed space, distributed – on average – across 2.3 buildings with 4.7 floors and 36 housing units per 
building. 
EPA developed values for multi-family project construction from R.S. Means 2007 National CostWorks data. 
R.S. Means reports construction cost per square foot for apartment complexes ranging from 1 – 24 stories, and a 
variety of construction material categories. Based on this data, EPA estimates an average multi-family 
construction cost per square foot value of $128.73.  
EPA has also estimated the total project square footage of roads, driveway, and sidewalk construction area based 
on ratios of such impervious surfaces to total the total project size as reported in a 2001 study of impervious cover 
and land use in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Capiella, 2001). R.S. Means provides values for the average cost 
of residential paving (e.g., roads, driveway) and sidewalk construction of $1.31 and $4.15 per square foot, 
respectively. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-9 
EPA assumed that overhead costs are 10% of total baseline construction costs for the single- and multi-family 
construction projects. EPA assumed that the loan to finance the total construction cost is initiated one year 
following the initiation of the land development loan and continues until the project is completed. The 
construction loans for single- and multi-family model projects are therefore two years in duration. Part of the 
construction loan is assumed to be financed through debt and part is financed using developer equity assuming a 
construction loan-to-value ratio of 80%, which is based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules. 
Lastly, EPA developed marketing fee and real estate sales commission values as a percentage of the sale price of 
each housing unit based on NAHB’s single-family housing unit construction cost data. EPA assumed that 
marketing fees are 2.7% of the cost of each unit constructed in a given project, and the sales commission is 4.6% 
of the cost of each unit constructed in the project. The marketing fees and sales commission are not assumed to 
carry a financing cost that will affect project price as they are assumed to be incurred late in the construction 
phase of the project – and hence, relatively close to the period when revenue from sale is realized. 
Non-Residential Building Projects 
The framework for developing the construction costs for the commercial and industrial building projects is 
conceptually the same as the multi-family construction cost framework. The frameworks differ primarily in the 
particular site characterizations developed from Reed Construction and the particular construction cost values 
developed from R.S. Means.  
The Reed Construction data indicate that, on average, a 1-acre commercial and industrial project consists of 
21,500 and 25,000 square feet of constructed area, respectively. EPA assumes there is 1 unit (or building) per 
project for the 1-acre commercial and industrial model projects. In terms of construction cost values, the R.S. 
Means data indicate average commercial and industrial construction cost per square foot of $131.22 and $84.62, 
respectively. The commercial construction cost value is based on the average construction cost per square foot, as 
reported by R.S. Means, for a variety of commercial projects such as banks, day care centers, Laundromats, retail 
stores, restaurants, supermarkets, and office buildings ranging from 1 to 10 stories. The industrial construction 
cost is based on the average construction cost per square foot, as reported by R.S. Means, for 1-story factories, 3-
story factories, and warehouses. R.S. Means also provides data for the average cost of commercial/industrial 
paving and sidewalk construction, which are $1.33 and $4.38 per square foot, respectively. 
EPA assumed overhead costs are 10% of total baseline construction costs for the commercial and industrial 
construction projects. EPA assumed the loan to finance the total construction cost is initiated one year following 
the initiation of the land development loan and continues until the project is completed. The construction loans for 
commercial and industrial model projects are therefore two years in duration. Part of the construction loan is 
assumed to be financed through debt and part is financed using developer equity assuming a construction loan-to-
value ratio of 80%, based on FDIC’s Real Estate Lending Rules. 
EPA also assigned marketing and sales fees to commercial and industrial model projects, using the same values of 
2.7% and 4.6% of the total sales price, respectively, from the residential project framework. The marketing fees 
and sales commission are not assumed to carry a financing cost as they are assumed to be incurred late in the 
construction phase of the project – and hence, relatively close to the period when revenue from sale is realized.

3.2.3 Estimating Project-Level Developer and Consumer Impacts  
The baseline model project frameworks incorporate the entire set of costs associated with acquiring, developing, 
and completing construction of housing units or buildings on a given site. Accordingly, EPA has assumed that the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-11 
baseline model project costs include the costs of complying with existing Phase I and Phase II NPDES stormwater 
regulations as they would apply to the site (e.g., 100 percent compliance baseline). An example 1-acre single-
family model project (e.g., 2.57 homes) is presented in Table 3-4 below to show the baseline specification of the 
model project framework and the resulting incremental changes in land development costs – and ultimately the 
home price – due to compliance outlays. The single family model project framework is specified using the key 
input parameters in Table 3-2. Recall from previous discussion of the project analysis that model frameworks 
were developed on a time-explicit basis that accounts for the timing of outlays and financing for land purchase, 
development, and construction, as well as the timing for incurring compliance outplays and the ultimate sale of 
the model construction project. EPA then calculated the discounted present value of project outlays; effectively 
collapsing the time-explicit framework into a single-period equivalent analysis. These collapsed, single-time-
period values appear in Table 3-4. 
Compliance costs for the proposed options are assumed to be incurred at the beginning of the land development 
phase of the project (i.e., beginning of year 2). The compliance outlays are therefore incorporated into the debt 
and equity financing for land development – financing which has a 3-year duration. As a result, notice in Table 
3-4 that the costs for land acquisition and construction do not change from baseline to post-compliance 
conditions, but costs for land development do change. In the example below, the land development loan and the 
capital outlay for land development both increase because part of the illustrative $3,500 per acre compliance 
outlay is financed through debt and part is financed through equity. The sum of the changes in debt and equity 
outlays ($2,625 + $875) equals the total per-acre compliance outlay value. These outlays then incur a multiplier 
effect due, respectively, to the 3-year costs of debt and equity financing. The result is that, from baseline to post-
compliance conditions, total land development costs increase by more than simply the compliance outlay (e.g., 
$4,496 land development cost increase vs. $3,500 compliance outlay). 
The increased cost for land development due to compliance outlays flows through the framework resulting in an 
increase in the total project cost before real estate fees, real estate fees, sales commission, and the ultimate sales 
price for each single-family housing unit constructed in the 1-acre project. The sales price per unit is equal to the 
final project cost divided by the number of housing units in the 1-acre project. The example in Table 3-4 indicates 
a $1,877 increase in price per unit due to the compliance costs. 
Also notice in Table 3-4 that, since the model project analysis assumed 100% cost-pass-through from developer to 
consumer, the developer’s return on equity does not change from baseline to post-compliance conditions.

3.2.3.1 Incorporating Compliance Costs into the Model Project Frameworks 
Using the baseline assumptions and conditions described previously, EPA calculated the sales price for each 
housing unit (or model commercial or industrial building). The project frameworks then allow EPA to assess the 
incremental impact of additional requirements imposed under the proposed regulatory options. Each model 
project incorporates an estimated national average incremental per-acre cost for each proposed option into the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-13 
land development phase of the project. As these costs are added to the other costs incurred during that phase, the 
financing requirements will increase. In turn, the developer’s cost for debt and equity financing and overhead 
associated with that phase of project development will also increase. 
3.2.3.2 Estimating Model Project Cost Multipliers 
An important purpose of the four model building project frameworks is to develop the incremental compliance 
cost multipliers that can be used to incorporate overhead, debt, and equity cost considerations into the per-acre 
compliance cost values used in subsequent analyses outlined in this document (Section 3.4 & 3.5). Once 
incremental compliance costs are incorporated into the model project framework, it produces – assuming 100% 
cost pass-through – a price differential relative to the baseline price. This price differential is higher than the 
incremental compliance costs assigned to the project by this implicit cost “multiplier” factor. The project cost 
multiplier reflects the additional overhead cost as well as the increase in the developer’s financing costs since 
compliance costs are brought into the project analysis framework. The multiplier is calculated by dividing the 
total change in the final project cost from the baseline by the incremental cost of compliance assigned to the 
project. Referring back to the example in Table 3-4, the multiplier is estimated by dividing $4,823 / $3,500. 
It is important to emphasize that neither the absolute dollar value of incremental compliance associated with a 
given project nor the baseline cost of the project determines the value of the cost multiplier. The multiplier 
represents a mark-up, per dollar of compliance, and is determined by the financing terms specified for the model 
projects. These include the debt cost, equity cost, loan to value ratios, and the durations of the loans for each 
phase of development. The multiplier value is therefore option-independent. In addition, since EPA has assumed 
that the four model projects follow the same development process with respect to these financing terms, the 
multiplier value is also constant across the model building projects. EPA estimated the project-level compliance 
cost multiplier to be 1.38, which means each dollar of incremental compliance cost becomes $1.38 of incremental 
price change for the construction unit due to debt and equity cost considerations. 
3.3 Analysis of Firm- and Industry-Level Economic Impacts 
3.3.1  Overview of Firm- and Industry-Level Analysis 
The firm- and industry-level analysis examines the impact of the rule’s compliance costs on firms in the major 
C&D industry segments that are expected to incur compliance requirements and costs because of the regulation:  
¾ Single-family residential construction 
¾ Multifamily residential construction  
¾ Industrial building construction  
¾ Commercial and institutional building construction 
¾ Non-building construction. 
EPA performed a firm-level analysis because, in concept, regulatory impacts on an affected industry are 
appropriately assessed at the level of the affected business entity – i.e., firm – instead of at the level of the 
individual products of the firm. Assessing impacts at the firm level supports understanding of potential impact in 
terms of occurrence of firm financial stress and firm closures, and related employment effects. A project-level 
analysis, for example, would not provide insight into these impact concepts. The firm- and industry-level analysis 
is based on model firms that represent the baseline (i.e., pre-regulation) financial performance and condition of 
“typical” businesses in these industry segments. These model firms are used in combination with compliance cost 
estimates to examine the potential for financial stress, employment effects, and increased barriers to the entrance 
of new firms to the industry.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-14 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
The model firms are structured as baseline financial statements for each of the NAICS sectors that align with the 
C&D industry segments expected to be affected by the regulation, and within NAICS sectors, by revenue size 
ranges for which data are reported by the Statistics of U.S. Business (SUSB) and the Economic Census (see 
Chapter 4: Developing the Analysis Baseline). The financial statements for the model firms are constructed to 
capture two business condition cases for the firm-level analysis:  
1. A General Business Conditions case, which is meant to reflect the financial performance and condition of 
C&D industry businesses during normal – neither excessively strong nor weak – economic conditions for 
the specific industrial segments. The analyses under the General Business Conditions case examine the 
potential for adverse impacts on firms over the longer term of general steady state business conditions in 
the C&D industries. 
2. An Adverse Business Conditions case, which is meant to reflect the financial performance and condition 
of C&D industry businesses during weak economic conditions for the specific industrial segments. 
During these periods, the potential economic/financial impact of the C&D rule may be relatively greater 
due to weakened financial performance and condition of the affected businesses and lower ability to 
recover compliance costs from customers. Thus, the analyses under the Adverse Business Conditions case 
provide a “worse case” assessment of the potential for adverse financial impact on firms as a result of the 
C&D rule. 
The two business condition cases are differentiated by the baseline operating financial circumstances of the model 
firms as well as other important factors in firm financial performance, including cost of debt and equity capital, 
and the estimated ability of the model firms to recover compliance costs from customers via price increases. 
Impact findings are assessed in terms of occurrence of compliance costs exceeding impact thresholds, increased 
frequency of weak financial condition and performance, and loss in business value from incurrence of compliance 
costs. The findings from the analysis of model firms are aggregated by revenue size range and total industry 
sector to assess the total potential adverse impact in the various sectors. These impact findings are also used in 
assessing the potential impact of the C&D rule on small entities. The model firm analysis also supports an 
assessment of potential barriers to entry for new businesses seeking to enter the C&D industry. 
The following sections describe the data sources and approach for the firm-level analysis:

As described in the preceding Chapter 2: Economic Profile of the Construction and Development Industry, EPA 
identified six principal C&D business segments that are expected to be within the scope of the proposed 
regulation and for which sufficient data are available to estimate compliance costs and assess potential regulatory 
effects. As the basis for its firm and industry impact analysis, EPA constructed model firms for the NAICS sectors 
aligning with each of these business segments: 
¾ New Single-Family Housing Construction (except Operative Builders) (NAICS sector 236115) 
¾ New Multifamily Housing Construction (except Operative Builders) (NAICS sector 236116) 
¾ New Housing Operative Builders (NAICS sector 236117)

¾ Industrial Building Construction (NAICS sector 236210) 
¾ Commercial and Institutional Building Construction (NAICS sector 236220) 
¾ Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction (NAICS sector 237310). 
Within each business segment, EPA further defined model firms according to business size based on seven 
revenue size categories in which SUSB and Economic Census report data. As described in Chapter 2, SUSB 
reports business data (e.g., number of entities, revenue, and number of employees) by “firm” while Economic 
Census reports business data by “establishment.” Each data source uses slightly different revenue size categories 
for reporting business data. Because this analysis is focused on “firm-level” impacts, the analysis relied primarily 
on SUSB as the data source for average size of business, and numbers of businesses and employees within 
revenue ranges. However, Economic Census data were used to disaggregate some of the SUSB revenue size 
ranges into smaller size ranges to improve understanding of the differences in baseline financial 
performance/condition by business size and how economic/financial impacts might vary by business size. The 
revenue ranges used in the firm-level analysis are: 
¾ Less than $1 million 
¾ $1 - $2.5 million 
¾ $2.5 - $5 million  
¾ $5 - $10 million  
¾ $10 - $50 million  
¾ $50 - $100 million  
¾ $100 million and greater 
The SUSB and Economic Census data are important for characterizing average business size, numbers of 
businesses, and employees within revenue size ranges. 
Economic Census and other data on the level of firm activity in terms of potential value and acreage of 
construction activity are later used to assign compliance costs to firms within these revenue size ranges. 
3.3.2.2 Assigning Baseline Financial Information to Model Firms 
EPA assigned baseline financial characteristics – balance sheet, income statement, and metrics of financial 
performance and condition – to each of the model firms as defined by NAICS sector and revenue size range, from 
financial statement information reported by Risk Management Association (RMA) in its publication, Annual 
Statement Studies. The RMA data are compiled from the financial statements submitted by the borrowers and 
applicants for lending to financial institutions, and are collected and reported annually. The number of statements 
represented in the RMA data for a given year varies from several hundred to several thousand in the business 
sectors analyzed. 
The firm-level financial models are defined for both the General Business Conditions case and Adverse Business 
Conditions case.  
¾ General Business Conditions case: RMA data by sector and revenue range for the 5-year period April 
2002 through March 2007 were used to define the General Business Conditions case models. As 
documented in Chapter 2, for all of the affected sectors, this 5-year period encompasses periods of 
relative weakness and strength.  
 For the residential construction sectors, 2002 through 2005 is a period of growth and generally good 
financial performance. However, beginning in 2006, this sector has been in a period of weakness.  
 For the non-residential construction sectors, 2000 to 2003 is a period of relative weakness. From 2003 
to 2005, these sectors saw relatively flat performance followed by strong growth in from late 2005 
into 2007. 
¾ Adverse Business Conditions case: To develop the Adverse Business Conditions case models, RMA data 
from the worst financial performance year in the 5-year period April 2002 through March 2007, as 
indicated in the RMA data for each sector, were used as the basis of the firm-level model financial 
statements. For the residential construction sectors, 2006 began a period of weakness; data from April 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-16 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
2006 through March 2007 was used for this case.16 For the non-residential sectors, 2003 began a period of 
weakness; data from April 2003 through March 2004 was used for this case.17 
The revenue ranges for which RMA reports data align closely with the revenue size categories derived from 
SUSB and Economic Census: 
Model Firm Revenue Range 
(from SUSB and Economic Census) 
 RMA Revenue Range Mapped to 
SUSB/Economic Census Revenue Range 
Less than $1 million  Less than $1 million 
$1 - $2.5 million  $1 - $3 million 
$2.5 - $5 million  $3 - $5 million 
$5 - $10 million  $5 - $10 million 
$10 - $50 million  $10 - $25 million 
$50 - $100 million  $25 million and greater 
$100 million and greater  $25 million and greater 
 
RMA reports balance sheet and income statement information by revenue range for firms in each of the six 
NAICS sectors for which model firms were developed. The balance sheet and income statement information is 
reported as percentages for important accounting items for the average statement in each business sector and size 
category: 
¾ Balance sheet – asset percentages are reported for the following items:  
                                                     
16  Data are not currently available for the full year of 2007, which would reflect a period of more substantial weakness in the residential 
construction sectors. 
17  The same data period was used for the non-building sector adverse business conditions case. 
 Cash & Equivalents 
 Trade Receivables (net) 
 Inventory 
 All Other Current Assets 
 Total Current Assets 
 Fixed Assets (net) 
 Intangibles (net) 
 All Other Non-Current Assets 
 Total Assets. 
¾ Balance sheet – capital elements (liabilities and equity) are reported for the following items:  
 Notes Payable-Short Term 
 Current Maturity of Long Term Debt 
 Trade Payables 
 Income Taxes Payable 
 All Other Current Liabilities 
 Total Current Liabilities 
 Long Term Debt 
 Deferred Taxes 
 All Other Non-Current Liabilities 
 Net Worth 
 Total Liabilities & Net Worth. 
¾ Income statement – income statement/operating statement are reported for the following items: 
 Net Sales 
 Gross Profit 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating Profit 
 All Other Expenses (net) 
 Profit Before Taxes 
In addition to reporting average income statement and balance sheet information, RMA also reports values for a 
large number of metrics of financial structure, performance, and condition by quartile – first quartile, median, and 
third quartile – as calculated from the statements in the sector and revenue size categories. Key metrics of interest 
for this analysis include:  
¾ Sales/Total Assets 
¾ Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets 
¾ Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Interest 
¾ Total Liabilities/Tangible Net Worth. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-17 
These financial metric values by quartile are important for developing baseline financial statements that vary by 
baseline financial condition and performance. This information is also used to establishing the values of financial 
performance metrics (for Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets and EBIT/Interest) that are judged indicative of below-
standard performance for the business sectors and thus can provide insight into the potential for adverse financial 
impact of the C&D rule by business sector and size. 
Steps in Developing the Baseline Financial Statements 
EPA performed the following steps to develop the baseline financial statements for the model firms: 
¾ Use the SUSB-reported average of revenue by sector and revenue range for 200218 as the baseline 
revenue value for firms within each business sector and revenue category. This value applies for each of 
the three quartiles of baseline financial performance.  
¾ Use RMA-reported value of Sales/Total Assets, by quartile, and SUSB-reported average of revenue by 
sector and revenue range to assign a baseline dollar value of total assets and capital (liabilities and equity) 
for firm-level balance sheets. This calculation yields a varying baseline total capitalization by baseline 
financial performance: as expected, more weakly performing firms have lower asset productivity as 
indicated by the ratio of sales to total assets and thus carry higher capitalizations for the given revenue 
value.  
¾ Use the RMA-reported values of Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets, EBIT/Interest, Total Liabilities/ Tangible 
Net Worth, by quartile, to develop baseline dollar-valued income statement and balance sheet for each of 
the three quartiles of baseline performance. These specific RMA-reported values are judged important as 
the basis for differentiating the baseline financial statements by baseline financial performance – lower 
quartile performance, median performance, and higher quartile performance – and thus providing insight 
into the potential impacts of the C&D rule on firms in varying baseline financial circumstances. All else 
equal, firms with weaker baseline financial circumstances would be at risk of more severe impacts than 
firms with stronger baseline financial circumstances. The basis for using these specific measures to 
establish financial statements by quartile is as follows: 
 Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets is a key measure of the fundamental asset productivity and profit 
performance of a business, and thus is an important differentiator of financial statements by baseline 
financial performance and condition. For this analysis, Pre-Tax and Pre-Interest Income/Total Assets 
would have provided stronger insight into basic business financial performance since the income 
measure would have been before payments to debt capital and thus independent of capital structure. 
However, RMA does not provide this financial measure. 
 Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Interest indicates the extent to which pre-interest and 
pre-tax income exceeds interest obligations and thus is a key measure of the ability of an enterprise to 
meet its current interest obligations and as well the risk to a borrower for extending additional credit 
to the enterprise. As such, EPA also judges this measure as an important differentiator of financial 
statements by baseline financial performance and condition. Businesses with relatively greater debt as 
a component of total capital and/or with relatively lower basic profitability will have lower 
EBIT/Interest values. 
                                                     
18  2002 is the most recent year for which SUSB and Economic Census data are available for the C&D sectors. While it is likely that the 
average value of revenue for firms in the various revenue range categories would differ now from the values observed in 2002, it is not 
possible to know the direction of change and there is no obvious basis – e.g., an index of business revenue change – on which to adjust 
the average revenue value. Therefore, this analysis uses the average revenue values by NAICS sector and revenue range for 2002 as 
the basis for the model firms.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-18 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
 Total Liabilities/Tangible Net Worth is less closely linked to baseline financial performance and 
condition and indeed is likely to be a managed element of capital structure. However, the measure is 
also a direct indicator of the riskiness of a firm’s capital structure – and of the risk of the capital 
structure to providers of both debt and equity capital. Because firms in weaker financial 
circumstances may be more likely to have higher debt as a component of total capital (e.g., as stated 
in the preceding paragraph, high debt in itself can be a contributor to a low EBIT/Interest value), this 
measure was also used to differentiate the baseline financial statements by performance/condition 
quartile.  
¾ In general, the median quartile reported values align closely with the values for these measures as 
calculated from the average financial statement information reported in the RMA statements. However, 
as expected, the RMA-reported values for the lower and upper quartiles of these metrics differ 
substantially from those indicated by the average financial statements. Accordingly, the lower and upper 
quartiles for the three financial measures were used to calibrate the baseline balance sheets and income 
statements to represent lower and upper quartile baseline financial statements for firms by sector and 
revenue range, as follows: 
 The fraction of total capitalization represented by baseline equity less intangible assets was adjusted 
to yield the reported value of Total Liabilities/Tangible Net Worth. The composition of the resulting 
residual of total liabilities was structured in terms of the baseline composition of liabilities for the 
average business by sector and revenue range. As a result, the financial statements for the lower 
quartile firm models are assigned a higher debt fraction of total capital than the median and upper 
quartile firms. 
 Total expenses before interest and tax expense and interest expense were adjusted to yield the target 
values of Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets and EBIT/Interest. This calculation yielded a baseline income 
statement value for interest expense, which is not broken out separately in the RMA-reported income 
statements (but is implicitly available through the reporting of the EBIT/Interest value), and is needed 
for the firm-level impact analysis. 
¾ As described more specifically in a later section, the analysis of baseline performance and potential 
impact of the C&D rule relies in part on an assessment of the change in business value of affected firms. 
To develop the baseline and post-compliance estimates of business value requires an estimate of after-tax 
income, which is not reported by RMA in its income statements. To calculate after-tax income, a 
composite federal/state income tax rate based on (1) the estimated federal rate applicable to pre-tax 
income for the given model firm and (2) an average of state tax rates of 7.3 percent, was applied to the 
indicated pre-tax income for the model firms. Where tax rates are unable to be differentiated by pre-tax 
income level – e.g., in the project analysis – a combined federal/state tax rate of 42.5 percent was used to 
account for tax effects.  
Estimating Baseline Business Value for the Model Firms 
The final step in developing the baseline firm financial models by sector, revenue range, and baseline 
performance quartile was to develop an estimate of the baseline business value of the model firms. As noted in the 
preceding paragraph, change in business value is one of the impact measures in the firm analysis. Baseline 
business value is determined as follows:  
¾ Calculate after-tax cash flow from operations available to debt and equity capital, which is the sum of 
after-tax income and interest payments on a pre-tax basis (total operating cash flow to all capital).19 
                                                     
19  The calculation of after-tax cash flow from operations would also typically involve adding back depreciation, since this a non-cash 
charge, and subtracting an allowance for ongoing outlays to maintain the existing capital stock and associated baseline production 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-19 
¾ Discount total operating cash flow to all capital by the estimated weighted average after-tax cost of 
capital, which yields going concern value for the business on the basis of total capital – i.e., debt and 
equity. 
¾ Subtract long-term liabilities from the total capitalization value to yield going concern value to the 
business’ equity owners. 
¾ Add net current assets to the net going concern value to yield total business value to the business’ equity 
owners, including net going concern value and net balance sheet liquidity. 
In this calculation, the business is assumed to operate in a “no real growth” steady state – i.e., the firm’s cash flow 
is assumed static, neither increasing nor decreasing, except for the effect of inflation. As a result, a discounted 
cash flow analysis using the cash flow from a single time period is appropriate for estimating the business value 
of the firm. 
Developing the Cost of Capital Used in Calculating the Business Value of Model Firms 
The cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow calculation is based on the model firm’s financial structure 
(debt and equity as fractions of total capital) and further varies according to business size (assumed to affect 
firms’ terms of access to capital markets) and the business conditions case (Copeland, 2000b). Elements of the 
cost of capital calculation are as follows: 
Cost of debt: 
¾ For the General Business Conditions case, based on the reported market yield of 7.0 percent for “Moody’s 
Baa-rated corporate bonds - all industries,” over the period 2000-2007 (U.S. Federal Reserve, 2007a).20 
The Baa rating is considered “Medium Grade” debt and is the lowest of the “Investment Grade” debt 
ratings.21 
¾ For the Adverse Business Conditions case, based on the estimated market yield of 12.7 percent for 
Moody’s B-rated debt in the year 2001, the most recent declared recession year in the U.S. economy 
(NBER, 2003). The B rating is considered “Low Grade (speculative)” and the second highest debt grade 
within the “Not Investment Grade” debt ratings. This rating and the associated debt cost would be 
appropriate for firms with appreciably weak financial performance. The estimated 12.7 percent cost for B-
rated debt is calculated from reported interest rate spreads for industrial bonds of various ratings against 
the debt cost for 10-year Treasury Bonds (Bondsonline, 2006).  
¾ To convert the debt cost to an after-tax basis, the debt costs are reduced by the estimated combined 
federal/state tax rate for each of the firm models, by revenue range, as described above. The resulting 
after-tax debt costs were applied to firms of all sizes in calculating a cost of capital for use in the firm-
level analysis. 
¾ The debt cost from this analysis for the General Business Conditions case is also used in the Analysis of 
Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts.  
Cost of equity: 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
capability. EPA did not “add back” depreciation in the cash flow calculation because no information was available for estimating an 
appropriate allowance for ongoing capital outlays. In effect, the value of depreciation recorded in the baseline operating statements is 
being treated as approximately equal to the ongoing capital outlay value.

¾ The cost of equity is calculated on the basis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) analytic 
convention, which determines the cost of equity capital as the return on a “riskless” investment plus a 
risk-adjusted equity market premium. The risk-adjusted equity market premium is based on a firm’s or 
sector’s undiversifiable, or systematic, market risk – conventionally defined as the market “beta” for the 
firm or sector22 – and the observed equity cost premium to the “riskless” investment – typically a 
Treasury bond of 10 years or more maturity (Copeland, 2000a). 
¾ The riskless return value is based on the average market yield, 4.7 percent, on 10-Year Treasury Bonds 
over the period 2000-2007 (U.S Federal Reserve, 2007b). 
¾ The equity market premium varies by business conditions case. The General Business Conditions case 
uses an equity market premium of 4.9 percent, which is at the lower end of the range of equity market 
premiums estimated for U.S. equity markets (Damoradan).23 The Adverse Business Conditions case uses 
a higher equity market premium of 6.0 percent to reflect the higher degree of investor risk aversion during 
periods of weak economic performance (Copeland, 2000a). 
¾ The beta values applied in the equity cost analysis are based on the average market beta for 41 publicly-
traded firms in the Homebuilding Sector24, as identified by the Value Line Investment Survey 
(Damoradan).25 Two beta values are used in the analysis. For model firms judged of sufficient size to 
access public markets for equity capital – $100 million and greater, the highest revenue category in the 
analysis – a public securities market beta of 0.98 is used in the cost of capital analysis. For model firms in 
the revenue categories below $100 million, which are judged not to be of sufficient size to access public 
capital markets, a so-called “total market risk” beta of 1.32 is used in the analysis. The “total” beta 
reflects the total variance in securities’ value for firms in the Value Line Homebuilding Sector and does 
not set aside the “diversifiable” component of variance. The “total” beta concept is judged more 
appropriate for estimating equity cost for private firms whose owners are likely to have heavily 
concentrated, less diversified ownership in those firms.  
¾ The resulting after-tax equity costs range from 9.5 percent for large businesses under the General 
Business Conditions case to 12.6 percent for small businesses under the Adverse Business Conditions 
case. 
The after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity are combined according to the baseline capital structure – debt and 
equity fractions of total long-term capital – of model firms, by sector, revenue range, and financial performance 
quartile, to yield the weighted average cost of capital used in the business value analysis for model firms.  
The cost of equity developed in this analysis is an after-tax cost of equity, since it reflects the income payable to 
the firm’s equity owners, which by definition, is after taxes. The General Business Conditions case equity cost is 
also used in the Project Analysis, although on a pre-tax basis. The after-tax cost of equity is converted to a pre-tax 
basis by dividing by one minus the estimated combined federal/state tax rate of 42.5 percent. 
Table 3-5, below, summarizes cost of capital values used in the firm and industry impact analysis.

relevant financial characteristics of firms in the construction and development industries.

private companies – are as reported by Aswath Damoradan.

As described at page 3-19, in the single-time-period “business perpetuity” analytic framework, all business 
operating financial parameters and, as a result, cash flow are assumed to be constant, except for the effect of 
inflation. Accordingly, the present value of cash flow is determined simply by dividing the constant (in real 
terms) cash flow value by the estimated cost of capital. To account for the effect of inflation in this analysis, the 
estimated cost of capital is reduced by the assumed constant rate at which cash flow is assumed to grow. This 
approach is equivalent mathematically to using a real discount rate (i.e., setting aside the component of cost of 
capital which results from inflation) in the discounted cash flow calculation. For this adjustment, EPA used a 
nominal cash flow growth rate of 3.1 percent, which is the average of year-to-year rates of change of the 
Engineering News-Record’s Construction Cost Index over the period 1990-2007 (McGraw Hill, 2008). 
As detailed in this section, the firm-level financial models are defined for both the General Business Conditions 
case and Adverse Business Conditions case. Table 3-6 summarizes the parameter definitions for these business

3.3.3 Assigning Compliance Costs to Model Firms 
The objective of this part of the firm- and industry-level analysis is to assign compliance costs to model firms to 
support assessment of the firm- and industry-level financial impacts of the C&D regulation. Compliance costs for 
a given regulatory option are assigned to the model firms, by sector and revenue range, based on the following 
considerations: 
¾ Whether the regulatory option is likely to impose costs on the specific sector and thus the model firms 
that represent that sector. For example, it is possible that a regulatory option will impose direct costs only 
on the obtainer/holder of the NPDES permit for Stormwater Discharges, and who is likely to be the 
owner/land developer (e.g., NAICS 236117, New Housing Operative Builders) and not necessarily a 
general contractor (e.g., NAICS 236115, New Single-Family Housing Construction (except Operative 
Builders)). Businesses in some sectors may be set aside from the firm-impact analysis based on such 
considerations. 
For the current analysis, EPA did not set aside from cost assignment any of the sectors identified in 
Chapter 2: Economic Profile of the Construction and Development Industry as likely to be affected by the 
C&D rule. 
¾ Within a given sector that is expected to be affected by the C&D rule, the extent to which revenue of 
firms in the sector results from construction activities that will be within the regulation’s scope. In a 
similar concept to the consideration stated above, it is also possible that the revenue of firms within a 
given sector would be only partially associated with in-scope activities. For example, if it were 
determined that the primary business activity of firms in the NAICS 236117, New Housing Operative 
Builders sector would be in-scope but that other revenue-generating activities of those firms are not 
likely to be within the regulation’s scope, then a part of the model firm revenue (and business activities) 
could be set aside from potentially incurring compliance costs. For this determination, EPA relies on the 
business specialization ratio as reported by the Economic Census for businesses in a given sector. The 
specialization ratio reports the average fraction of businesses’ revenues in a sector that arise from the 
sector’s primary business activity. This data allows EPA to exclude the fraction of firm revenue that is, on 
average, associated with additions or maintenance work, which is not in-scope of the regulation since this 
revenue does not come from new construction.

¾ The estimated construction project acreage for the various model firms. EPA estimated compliance costs 
for each regulatory option on a per-acre and state-by-state basis based on project size, type of 
construction, compliance requirement, and state-specific factors such as presence of overlapping 
regulatory requirements, varying levels of labor and other compliance input costs, rainfall levels, and soil 
characteristics. Accordingly, the quantity of acreage developed by a model firm that could be within the 
scope of the regulation is a key determinant of the compliance cost assigned to the firm. As the first step 
in determining the quantity of in-scope acreage of a given model firm, EPA estimated the total 
construction acreage on which a model firm could initiate (or complete) potentially in-scope projects in a 
single year. This determination is based on the concept of acreage intensity described in Chapter 4. As 
described in that chapter, acreage intensity is the acreage quantity per dollar of construction project value 
(which is assumed to translate to business revenue) and was estimated by EPA for the principal 
construction activities – single-family housing construction, multifamily housing construction, 
commercial project construction, and industrial project construction – estimated to be within the scope of 
the C&D rule. For a given model firm defined by sector and revenue range, construction project acreage 
is calculated as follows: 
rrsctrsctrrrsctr RevenueIntensityAcreageAcreage ,, *_=  (1)
Where: 
Acreagesctr,rr = Construction Project Acreage for model firms by sector and revenue range 
Acreage_Intensitysctr = Acres per Dollar of Project Value, derived from Census of Housing and Reed 
Construction data 
Revenuesctr,rr = Model firm revenue by sector and revenue range 
¾ The fraction of model firms and associated project acreage within a given revenue range that is of 
sufficient scale to be within the scope of a given regulatory option. In developing regulatory options, EPA 
considered a number of minimum project size thresholds that would fall within the scope of a given 
option – e.g., projects of at least one acre in size, projects of at least ten acres in size. EPA also evaluated 
regulatory options in which regulatory requirements vary by project size – e.g., one level of requirement 
for projects on sites of at least one acre area but less than ten acres, a second, higher level of requirement 
for projects on sites of at least ten acres area. Accordingly, it was necessary to identify whether a given 
model firm could undertake projects that are of sufficient scale to meet one or more of the site size 
thresholds defined for a given regulatory option. The concept relied on here is the same as that in the 
preceding step – acreage intensity in conjunction with model firm revenue – but in this case acreage 
intensity is used to determine the critical revenue value that is sufficient to perform projects within the 
regulatory option’s coverage, and based on the critical revenue value, the fraction of model firms and 
associated project acreage in a given revenue range that are in-scope for a given regulatory option.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-25 
The critical revenue value for an option and sector is the revenue that is estimated to be necessary to 
initiate or bring to completion annually a single project of sufficient acreage to be within a regulatory 
option’s coverage. The critical revenue value is calculated as: 
sctrrorosctr IntensityAcreageMinAcreageCriticalRevenue _/__ , =  (2)
Where: 
Revenue_Criticalsctr,ro = Minimum revenue for performing a single project in a given sector for a given 
regulatory option 
Acreage_Minro = Minimum site acreage subject to a regulatory option or to specific requirements 
within a regulatory option 
Acreage_Intensitysctr = Acres per Dollar of Project Value 
For example, if Acreage Intensity = 0.8 acres per $1 million of value and Minimum Site Acreage = 1 acre, 
then the Critical Revenue Value = $1.25 million (1 acre ÷ 0.8 acres per $1 million of value).  
Given the critical revenue value for a given regulatory option, the in-scope fractions of model firms and 
project acreage by regulatory requirement are determined as follows: 
 If a revenue range lies entirely below the critical revenue value, then all firms in the revenue range 
and all project acreage within the revenue range are assumed to be out-of-scope for that regulatory 
coverage threshold. That is,  
0_ , =rrsctrInscFr  (3)
Where: 
Fr_Inscsctr,rr = Estimated fraction of in-scope acreage for a given model firm sector and 
revenue range 
 If a revenue range lies entirely above the critical revenue value, then all firms in that revenue range 
are assumed to be capable of performing in-scope projects for that regulatory coverage threshold. 
However, all of the projects performed within that revenue range and the associated revenue will not 
be in-scope to the extent that firms perform a blend of projects of varying site sizes – some of which 
exceed the regulatory coverage threshold and some are below the regulatory coverage threshold. To 
capture this concept, EPA used the estimated fraction of total projects and acreage by site size and 
developed from the NOI dataset (see Chapter 4) to estimate the fraction of total model firm acreage 
that would be in-scope of a given regulatory option (or the specific requirements step of a regulatory 
option, for options with stepped requirements by site size).  
rosctrrrsctr InscFrInscFr ,, __ =  (4)
Where: 
Fr_Inscsctr,rr = Estimated fraction of in-scope acreage for a given model firm sector and 
revenue range 
Fr_Inscsctr,ro = Estimated fraction of total acreage for a given construction sector occurring in 
projects that exceed the regulatory coverage threshold for a given regulatory 
option. 
 If the critical revenue value lies within a revenue range, the fraction of firms estimated to be capable 
of performing in-scope activities – and their associated in-scope project acreage – are calculated using 
the assumption that firms by revenue are distributed uniformly over the revenue range.

( )( )lowrrhighrrrosctrhighrrrosctrrrsctr RevRevCriticalRevRevInscFrInscFr ,,,,,, _*__ −= −  (5)
Where: 
Fr_Inscsctr,rr = Estimated fraction of in-scope acreage for a given model firm sector and 
revenue range 
Fr_Inscsctr,ro = Estimated fraction of total acreage for a given construction sector occurring in 
projects that exceed the regulatory coverage threshold for a given regulatory 
option. 
Revrr,high = Upper bound of revenue range 
Rev_Criticalsctr,ro = Minimum revenue for performing a single project in a given sector for a given 
regulatory option 
Revrr,low = Lower bound of revenue range 
For any given combination of Minimum Site Acreage for a regulatory option and Acreage Intensity, these 
calculations probably overstate, perhaps substantially, the fraction of firms that can perform in-scope 
activities because (1) all of the firm’s activity and annual revenue is assumed to be derived from a single 
project and (2) for all but the lowest revenue range, firms by revenue are not likely to be distributed 
uniformly within the revenue range, but instead their mass is likely to be concentrated at the lower end of 
the range.  
¾ The resulting in-scope project revenue and acreage by model firm. For each model firm defined by sector 
and revenue range, multiplying the total possible acreage by the estimated fraction of in-scope acreage 
yields the total in-scope acreage for the model firm. Other ways of interpreting this concept are that the 
estimated fraction of in-scope acreage is equivalent to the fraction of firms and/or fraction of model firm 
revenue within the revenue range that is associated with construction activities within the scope of a 
regulatory option. 
¾ The estimated compliance cost for each model firm. Based on the estimated in-scope acreage by model 
firm, compliance costs for the model firm are calculated by multiplying the estimated compliance cost per 
acre for the given regulatory option by the number of in-scope acres for the model firm. For regulatory 
options with only one set of regulatory requirements or for firms that are capable of performing only 
projects that fit within the first regulatory requirement of a multi-stepped option, this calculation is 
straightforward: in-scope acreage times compliance cost per acre yields model firm compliance costs. For 
regulatory options with more than one set of regulatory requirements that vary by site size and for firms 
that are capable of performing projects in the higher site size range, the compliance cost per acre used in 
the calculation is a weighted average of compliance costs based on the estimated fractions of projects by 
site size undertaken by the model firm in each of the site size ranges for the regulatory option.  
EPA performed the estimation and assignment of compliance costs to model firms on a state-by-state basis for 
each regulatory option. EPA estimates that the incidence of compliance requirements and compliance costs per 
acre of construction activity will vary from state to state. The variation over states results from three factors: 
1. The presence of state requirements that, in some instances, capture elements of the compliance 
requirements of a given regulatory option. For those states in which all or part of the requirements of a 
given C&D rule regulatory option are already required by the states, EPA adjusted the compliance costs 
per acre to reflect only the incremental requirement, if any, for the regulatory option in estimating costs 
for the state.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-27 
2. For some regulatory options, variation by state in soil characteristics and rainfall levels, which may affect 
the extent and character of compliance response required for a regulatory option.  
3. Variation in compliance activity costs by state resulting from differences in labor and other compliance 
input costs by state. 
As a result of these factors, for certain regulatory options, some states have no or substantially lower compliance 
costs per acre of construction activity than other states. As a result, the assessments of aggregate sector and 
industry level impacts described in later sections of this chapter are based on the model firm analyses performed 
on a state-by-state basis. The state-by-state findings are then aggregated to the national level to yield national cost 
and impact results. 
3.3.4 Estimating the Change in Model Firm Financial Performance and Condition 
The firm-level compliance cost estimates are assigned to the model firms to support assessment of the potential 
financial impact of the C&D regulation. The impact assessments at the level of the model firms are used in 
Section 3.3.5: Applying the Findings from the Model Firm Analysis to the Total Industry to assess industry level 
effects, accounting for the numbers of firms by affected sector and revenue range that are expected to be within 
the scope of the C&D regulation. 
3.3.4.1 Impact Concepts for the Analysis 
Three concepts of economic/financial impact are used in the firm- and industry-level impact analysis: 
1. A “screening level” impact measure based on comparison of annual compliance costs to revenue. EPA 
generally judges compliance costs that are less than one percent of revenue as not imposing a material 
economic/financial burden on affected businesses. Costs exceeding three percent of revenue are judged as 
potentially imposing a material economic/financial burden, while the findings for costs between one and 
three percent of revenue are generally viewed as inconclusive in terms of economic/financial burden. This 
assessment, which examines the frequency with which compliance costs exceed one and three percent of 
revenue, is also important for the small entity impact analysis. This impact measure is also used in the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis of impact on small entities. 
2. Changes in two key measures of firm financial performance and condition, based on application of 
compliance costs to the model firm financial statements: 
 Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets, a key measure of the fundamental asset productivity and profit 
performance of a business. Businesses with weak return on assets will be unable to provide 
competitive returns to investors and will have difficulty attracting capital to support the ongoing 
business as well as business expansion. 
 Earnings before Interest and Taxes/Interest, which indicates the extent to which pre-interest and pre-
tax income exceeds interest obligations and thus is a key measure of the ability of an enterprise to 
meet its current interest obligations and as well the risk to a borrower for extending additional credit 
to the enterprise.26  
The assessment for these two financial measures estimates the fraction of firms in the various sector and 
revenue ranges for which the financial measures decline – because of compliance outlays – to levels 
indicative of material financial weakness. The analysis uses the lower quartile of these financial measures 
                                                     
26  These are two of the financial measures reported by RMA for median, lower and upper quartiles by sector and business size that were 
used in constructing the baseline financial statements for the model firms.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-28 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
as developed from the RMA statements for a given sector for the General Business Conditions case27 as 
the threshold value of financial weakness.  
3. Change in business value, based on application of compliance costs to the model firm financial 
statements, and the fraction of firms whose net business value becomes negative because of compliance 
outlays. This impact measure is used as an indicator of potential closures due to the regulation. EPA also 
estimated and reports the employment in firms that are potential closures. This employment is at risk from 
the potential closure of these facilities. In Section 3.5.3.2: Estimating the Loss in C&D Output, page 3-50, 
EPA describes estimation of a potential employment effect resulting from an estimated contraction in 
C&D industry output due to the regulation. These potential employment effects are different in concept. 
The employment effect from firm closures results from some firms being marginal financial performers 
that may cease business because of regulatory requirements. These potential job losses, if they do occur, 
are not necessarily permanent losses in the C&D industry but may be better thought of as dislocations as 
some firms cease operations but other, financially more healthy, firms increase activity and restore part or 
all of these losses. On the other hand, the employment losses from potential contraction of C&D industry 
output, as described in Section 3.5.3.2, may be understood as permanent losses. 
These assessments of impact for these measures are performed for two analysis cases: 
¾ Primary Impact Analysis Case: This case reflects EPA’s best estimates of the likely impact of the C&D 
rule under general business conditions and is presented as the primary impact assessment in Chapter 5: 
Economic Impact Analysis Results. For this case, firms are assumed to pass on part of the compliance 
outlay to other parties. The extent of pass-through varies by sector and is determined from the market 
level analysis outlined in Section 3.5: Analysis of Social Cost. In addition, this case reflects the General 
Business Conditions case of baseline firm financial performance and condition. 
¾ Adverse Impact Analysis Case: This case reflects more adverse, not business as usual, business 
conditions and is presented as an assessment of how the regulation might affect businesses during adverse 
business conditions. For this case, firms are assumed to absorb all of the compliance outlay within their 
current operating finances – i.e., unable to pass on any of the compliance outlay to customers or to the 
sellers of the land on which development occurs. In addition, this case reflects the Adverse Business 
Conditions case of baseline firm financial performance and condition. The findings from this analysis are 
presented in an appendix to Chapter 5: Economic Impact Analysis Results. 
A third case – 100% cost pass-through – in which all compliance outlays are assumed to be passed on to other 
parties, is also possible. However, this case is not directly addressed in the firm-level impact analysis, since 
businesses experience no adverse financial impact under this cost pass-through case. This case is assessed in 
terms of potential regulation impacts on consumers (Section 3.4: Analysis of Single-Family Housing Affordability 
Impacts, page 3-33).  
3.3.4.2 Incorporating Compliance Cost Estimates into Baseline Financial Statements  
Model-firm compliance cost estimates from Section 3.3.3 are incorporated into the baseline income statement and 
balance sheet for each model firm to assess how compliance costs change the key financial ratios and business 
value for the representative construction firms. 
For the firm-level analysis, model firms are assumed to be in a steady state of operations in which a constant level 
of activity – project starts and project completions – subject to regulation occurs year-to-year. The financial 
                                                     
27  That is, the threshold values that are used for assessing adverse financial impact are based on the General Business Conditions case 
estimates regardless of whether the analysis is being performed for the General Business Conditions case or the Adverse Business 
Conditions case.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-29 
impact of compliance outlays can be assessed as a one-time change to this steady state condition, based on the 
level of activity subject to regulation that is initiated in a given year. Key assumptions in this analysis include: 
¾ Model firms are assumed to finance compliance outlays 80 percent from debt and 20 percent from equity 
capital.  
¾ In the no cost pass-through analysis, the compliance outlay affects the income statement as follows:  
 Cost of revenue is increased by the amount of the compliance outlay, in turn reducing business gross 
profit. 
 Interest expense is increased by the one-period cost for interest on the debt for financing the outlay. 
Interest is charged according to the business conditions case being analyzed. 
 Pre-tax income is reduced by the amount of the compliance outlay and interest expense. 
 After-tax income is reduced by the amount of the compliance outlay and interest expense times the 
model firm’s tax rate, which is determined from a schedule of combined federal/state corporate tax 
rates varying by pre-tax income level. 
¾ In the no cost pass-through analysis, the compliance outlay affects the balance sheet as follows:  
 The total compliance outlay, including interest cost on debt financing is assumed to be recorded as an 
increase in non-current assets. 
 Debt is increased by the debt fraction of the total compliance outlay; equity is increased by the equity 
fraction of the outlay. 
¾ In the partial cost pass-through analysis, the analysis differs in that the compliance outlay is assumed to 
be partially recovered through an increase in revenue, which in turn results in a lower reduction in net 
income on the income statement, and an increase in current assets, and a lower increase in non-current 
assets on the balance sheet.  
The changes in income statement and balance sheet translate into changes in the financial impact measures and 
also affect the business value analysis by reducing after-tax cash flow and increasing the liabilities that are 
subtracted away in calculating business net worth. 
3.3.4.3 Assessing the Effect of Compliance Outlays on the Impact Measures 
As described above, three impact concepts are accounted for in the firm impact analysis:  
1. Occurrence of compliance costs exceeding one and three percent of revenue – a screening-level measure 
of financial impact. 
2. Deterioration in measures of financial performance and condition to levels that would indicate financial 
stress to the enterprise.  
3. Decline to a negative net worth business value, which is assumed to point to a risk of business closure. 
Occurrence of Compliance costs Exceeding One and Three Percent of Revenue 
The “screening level” cost-to-revenue measure is assessed as whether the total compliance outlay, including 
financing cost, exceeds thresholds of one and three percent of revenue.  
This analysis is performed at the model firm revenue level within each revenue range and using the distribution of 
acreage intensity (see Chapter 4) to assess the potential for compliance costs to exceed the one and three percent 
thresholds. Specifically, for each model firm by sector and revenue range, the calculation first determines the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-30 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
levels of compliance cost that would exceed one and three percent of revenue – critical compliance cost levels. 
The analysis then calculates the acreage intensity that would yield the critical compliance cost, given the 
relationships for determining compliance cost by model firm as outlined in Section 3.3.3, above. Finally, the 
analysis looks to the distributions of acreage intensity by sector to estimate the percentage of firms within the 
revenue range for which compliance cost would exceed the indicated critical compliance cost values.  
This calculation is performed in two ways:  
1. Using the unadjusted compliance cost. This metric indicates the potential burden of compliance costs in 
relation to revenue, without accounting for the likelihood that some of the compliance cost will be offset 
by increase revenue. 
2. Using the compliance cost adjusted by the increase in revenue that is estimated to occur from passing on a 
part of the compliance cost increase to customers as a price increase. This measure may provide a more 
meaningful measure of potential compliance cost burden. In this calculation, the total compliance cost is 
simply reduced by the increase in revenue resulting from cost pass-through. The resulting comparison is 
of net compliance cost burden (i.e., after offsetting revenue increase) to baseline revenue. 
Deterioration in Measures of Financial Performance 
In the financial measures analysis, baseline and post-compliance values of the measures are calculated for the 
median, lower quartile, and upper quartile model firm financial statements within each sector and revenue range. 
Impact findings are assessed in terms of the estimated fraction of firms by sector and revenue range whose 
financial performance value declines below financial weakness thresholds as a result of compliance outlays. This 
analysis involves the following steps: 
¾ For each financial performance measure, the baseline and post-compliance values of the median, lower 
quartile and upper quartile values are used to construct baseline and post-compliance linear-segmented 
cumulative distributions. These distributions are developed separately on a baseline and post-compliance 
basis, by revenue range within each sector.  
¾ The baseline first quartile value for each financial measure over the entire sector (i.e., all revenue size 
categories) and for the General Business Conditions case is used as the Critical Threshold Value for 
assessing material financial weakness for a given sector.  
¾ The baseline distribution is used to determine the fraction of firms, by revenue range and sector, falling 
below the critical threshold value for each financial performance measure in the baseline – i.e., before 
application of compliance costs. In reaching this determination, EPA assumed that firms are uniformly 
distributed within the linear segments of the cumulative distribution of financial performance measure 
values. Because the analysis uses a critical threshold value that is determined at the sector level and does 
not vary by revenue range within the sector, the baseline percentage of firms falling below the threshold 
value varies by revenue range within the sector. Typically, a fraction larger than 25 percent of firms in the 
smaller revenue ranges fall below the impact threshold value, while less than 25 percent of firms in the 
higher revenue ranges fall below the threshold value.  
¾ The post-compliance distribution is developed from the financial performance values for the median, 
lower quartile, and upper quartile model firms, based on application of compliance costs to the model 
firms, as described in previous sections. In effect, the post-compliance distribution is a shifted version of 
the baseline distribution with the newly calculated median, lower quartile, and upper quartile values being 
lower than the values at these same percentile points on the baseline distribution. 
¾ The post-compliance distribution is then used to determine the fraction of firms, by revenue range and 
sector, falling below the critical threshold value for each financial performance measure. The difference

between the post-compliance and baseline percentages indicates the percentage of model firms in a given 
sector and revenue range that move below the critical threshold value because of the incurrence of 
compliance costs from a given regulatory option.  
Key elements of these calculations are summarized in Table 3-8, below.

As described above, the estimated increase in percentage of firms falling below a given threshold value is the 
measure of impact, by sector, for each financial measure. EPA used the greater of the impact percentages for each 
financial measure, by revenue range and sector, as a composite indicator of financial stress, by revenue range and 
sector. These firms are assessed as potentially incurring material financial weakness as a result of regulatory 
requirements. 
Occurrence of Negative Business Value  
The analysis of change in business value is comparable in structure to the financial measures analysis, with 
baseline and post-compliance business value being calculated at median, lower quartile, and upper quartile model 
firm financial statements within each sector and revenue range. These quartile values are again used to construct 
linear-segmented cumulative distributions of business value by sector and revenue range. As described above, the 
baseline distribution of business value shifts as a result of compliance costs, leading to an increased fraction of 
firms, by sector and revenue range, whose business value is assessed as negative, and thus at risk of closure. 
Impact findings are assessed in terms of the fraction and resulting number of firms whose net business value falls 
below zero as a result of compliance.

As described above, EPA interprets this impact measure as an indicator of potential closures due to the regulation. 
3.3.5 Applying the Findings from the Model Firm Analysis to the Total Industry 
EPA used the findings from the model firm analyses by sector and revenue range to estimate the industry-level 
cost and impact of each regulatory option.  
3.3.5.1 Estimating Industry Level Occurrence of Economic/Financial Impacts 
Industry-level impacts are estimated by extending the findings from the model firm analysis to the specific 
revenue ranges and sectors that are represented by the model firms. The percentage of firms estimated to incur an 
adverse financial impact finding – cost exceeding one or three percent of revenue; incurring financial stress due to 
regulatory requirements; or encountering negative business value due to regulatory requirements – by sector and 
revenue range, are multiplied by the number of firms in the relevant combinations of sector and revenue range to 
estimate the total number of firms expected to incur the indicated financial impact. Estimation of the numbers of 
firms by sector, revenue range and state, is described in the regulatory analysis baseline (see Chapter 4). As 
described in Section 3.3.3, EPA performed the firm and industry level analyses on a state-by-state basis and 
aggregated the findings over states to yield national level estimates. These calculations provide estimates of the 
number of firms (and percentage within all firms in a given sector) that are estimated to incur the various impact 
measures. In addition, for firms estimated to incur the various financial impacts, EPA assessed total potential 
employment at risk based on the employment totals reported in the SUSB/Economic Census data by sector and 
revenue range. 
Firms expected to experience financial stress may need to change their business operations, including potentially 
down-sizing or closing operations. However, the actual likelihood of these outcomes may be quite low given that 
these analyses are conditioned only on the so-called “less than full cost pass-through” cases. Furthermore, these 
business effects may not be noticeable within the ordinary course of business changes in the C&D industry, where 
year-to-year fluctuations in the level of business activity can be quite substantial as a result of changing 
macroeconomic conditions (e.g., interest rates, overall strength of the national economy) and/or changing local 
economic conditions (e.g., strength of local industries). Finally, the C&D industry is a relatively fluid industry, as 
documented in the industry profile, with low barriers to entry and considerable entry and exit activity from year to 
year. As a result, the potential employment losses or capital-idling effects of weakness in a specific firm are likely 
to be offset by changing levels of activity in other existing firms or entry of new firms into the local market. 
3.3.5.2 Estimating Total Cost of Compliance and Total Acreage Incurring Compliance Costs  
The estimate of total industry level effects also yields an estimate of total annual compliance outlays and related 
project acreage by sector and revenue range, and in aggregate, over all sectors and revenue ranges, for a given 
regulatory option. This calculation is performed by simply aggregating the estimated compliance costs and 
acreage over revenue ranges, sectors, and states for a given regulatory option. 
In developing the baseline estimates of total construction activity acreage that underlie the firm- and industry-
level analysis, EPA needed to reconcile the estimates of construction activity derived from the “bottom-up” model 
firm analysis to the “top-down” construction activity estimates (based on the National Land Coverage Database) 
by adjusting the acreage intensity values underlying the model firm analysis. A similar adjustment was performed 
for each of the regulatory options to align the total compliance cost estimates from the “bottom-up” analysis with 
the “top-down” analysis. For some regulatory options considered, this adjustment required an increase in the 
activity estimates underlying the firm- and industry-level analysis. In other cases, the adjustment required a 
decrease in the activity estimates underlying the firm- and industry-level analysis. The effect of these adjustments 
is to increase or decrease the total cost, compliance acreage and related estimates of firm- and industry-level 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-33 
economic/financial impacts. Chapter 4 provides a more complete description of the approach EPA used to 
reconcile estimates of construction activity from the engineering cost to the model firm analysis. 
3.3.6 Assessing Potential Barriers to Entry of New Businesses to the C&D Industry 
EPA also examined the potential for the C&D regulatory options to pose a barrier to entry for new businesses 
seeking to enter the C&D industry. This analysis, which is presented in Chapter 5, looked specifically at the 
extent to which the regulation would increase the capital required by firms of various revenue sizes to participate 
in the industry. A substantial increase in capital requirements could mean that some firms might not be able to 
assemble the capital necessary to participate in the industry. 
For this assessment, EPA made the following assumptions:  
¾ For any given revenue level, the capital required for entry to the industry is no different than the capital 
required by existing businesses for their continued participation in the industry. 
¾ The total estimated compliance outlay would need to be financed by both existing businesses and new 
entrants to the industry. 
¾ For any given revenue level, the total estimated compliance outlay would be the same for existing 
businesses and new entrants.  
To assess the potential entry barrier effect, EPA compared the estimated financing requirement associated with 
compliance outlays to baseline total assets for each of the model firms, by industry sector and revenue range, as 
described in Chapter 4: Developing the Analysis Baseline. The comparison of financing requirement to the model 
firm’s assets assumes that the compliance outlay would be financed and recorded on the model firm’s balance 
sheet. To the extent that the compliance outlay is financed and recorded not on the firm’s baseline sheet but as 
part of a separate project-based financing for each individual project, this comparison is likely to overstate, 
perhaps substantially, the incremental burden of financing in relation to the going concern asset base of the model 
firms. 
In estimating the additional financing requirement for each model firm, EPA assumed, as outlined in the model 
project discussion (Section 3.2: Analysis of Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts), that construction projects 
require, on average, four years to complete, and that the compliance outlay and hence the additional financing 
requirement occurs at the beginning of the second project year. As a result, the additional financing requirement 
for a individual project is assumed to be carried on the firm’s baseline sheet for three years (i.e., until project 
completion) and the steady state increase in financing requirements is thus approximately three times the single 
project outlay – assuming a steady state operating condition of constant project and revenue activity by year as 
outlined in Section 3.3.4.2: Incorporating Compliance Cost Estimates into Baseline Financial Statements.  
If the resulting additional financing requirement is substantial in relation to baseline assets, then the additional 
requirement could pose a material entry barrier.  
3.4 Analysis of Single-Family Housing Affordability Impacts 
Because the C&D rule may increase the cost of housing construction and, as a result, the price (or rent) of 
housing, the regulation has the potential to adversely affect consumers of newly constructed housing. Given this 
potential effect, EPA performed a regional-level analysis (i.e., level of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)) that 
estimates the number and fraction of potential single-family home buyers whose purchasing decisions may be 
affected by the potential increase in the price of newly constructed, single-family housing. The results of the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-34 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
analysis are then reported (in Chapter 5) at the national-level by aggregating the number of potentially affected 
households across the MSAs in each state. 
An MSA-level affordability analysis is more robust than a regional- or national-level analysis because it is able to 
capture the high variability in housing market prices and household incomes across and within states. For this 
analysis, EPA used MSA-level single-family new home prices and household income distributions to determine 
the number of prospective home-purchasing households that are at or above the income level estimated to be 
necessary to qualify for the financing of a newly constructed single-family home. This analysis involved the 
following steps: 
¾ Calculating critical income values for the median- and lower-quartile-priced new home in each MSA, 
based on standard home-loan underwriting criteria and estimates of the total monthly housing payment, 
including mortgage loan, property tax, and property insurance. Property tax and property insurance are 
estimated by MSA. The critical income value is the value at which a household could just afford the 
median- or lower-quartile-priced home. 
¾ Calculating the increase in home prices due to the compliance costs of the proposed regulatory options 
and the new critical income values for the median- and lower-quartile-priced home, by MSA. To provide 
a worst case assessment, the increase in new home price assumes that 100 percent of compliance costs 
will be passed through in housing prices.28 Although this housing price effect may occur in “tight” 
markets, this extent of housing price effect is not likely to persist over the long-term. And, in periods of 
housing market weakness, such as currently occurring in U.S. housing markets, the assumption of 100 
percent compliance cost pass-through may overstate substantially the price effect, and therefore critical 
income value effect, from the regulatory options.29 
¾ Calculating the numbers of prospective home-purchasing households, for the median- and lower-quartile-
priced home, by MSA, whose purchasing decision is potentially affected by the increase in housing price. 
The number of affected households is calculated from the MSA-based household income distributions by 
first determining the number of prospective home-purchasing households that just qualify to purchase the 
median- and lower-quartile-priced home, by MSA, at the baseline price, and then subtracting from these 
values, the number of households that just qualify to purchase at the higher, post-compliance-based 
prices. 
In performing these calculations, EPA recognized that, at any given time, the number of households that 
are actually “in the market” for purchasing a home is significantly less than the number of households in 
an MSA. EPA further recognized that the number of these households whose purchasing decision might 
be practically affected – i.e., seek to purchase a new single-family house whose price is affected by a 
given regulatory option – is smaller again than the number of households seeking to purchase a home. 
Accordingly, in developing the estimates of potentially affected households, EPA reduced the numbers of 
households by income range in the total MSA household income distribution to account for these 
considerations.  
                                                     
28  For each regulatory option, the price change per single-family housing unit was applied as a direct add-on to the median- and lower-
quartile new home prices. 
29  It is important to note that the assumption of full cost pass-through for the affordability analysis effectively contradicts the analysis 
assumptions of partial and no cost pass-through used in the assessment of potential firm and industry level impacts. That is, for there 
to be material effects in the firm and industry impact analysis, costs must not be fully passed through to consumers and some cost and 
economic impact burden must remain at the level of the industry’s business participants. And, conversely, for there to be material 
effects in the affordability analysis, costs must be passed through to consumers. Accordingly, both sets of analysis assumptions, and as 
a result, the potential impact findings, cannot occur at the same time in a given market: that is, adverse effects on the industry’s 
business participants will mean less potential for advserse affordability effects, and adverse affordability effects will mean less 
potential for adverse effects on the industry’s business participants.

The overall objective of this analysis is to account for the possibility that an increase in the price of a new, in-
scope single-family home may increase the income necessary to qualify for a mortgage to purchase the home and, 
therefore, potentially influence the purchasing decision of likely home buyers. However, a finding of a marginal 
affordability effect for likely home buyers does not mean that these households would be unable to afford a home. 
Rather, the analysis indicates that some households may need to adjust the preferential dimensions of their 
housing purchase, or the timing of the purchase, to accommodate the higher price estimated potentially to result 
from the C&D industry regulation. For example, to purchase a new, in-scope single-family home, the housing 
purchaser might offset the increase in the monthly mortgage payment by changing some housing attribute in order 
to offset the increase in price from regulation compliance, or by increasing their initial down payment. 
Alternatively, the prospective home purchaser might decide to purchase a home whose price is not affected by 
regulation’s compliance requirements. These interpretive considerations are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 
along with the analysis results. 
3.4.1 Estimating Critical Income Values for Single-Family Home Purchases  
The critical income value is the income at which a household can just afford the median- or lower-quartile-priced 
home. The first step in estimating this baseline income value is to establish the price for the median- and lower-
quartile new single-family home price, by MSA. 
Median- and lower-quartile home prices from the Census Bureau’s 2006 American Community Survey (ACS) 
serve as the baseline home prices (2006 was chosen because it is the most recent year for which the required 
MSA-level data are available from the Census). The ACS provides the median new home price (homes built in 
2005 or later) as well as the median- and lower-quartile home price for all existing homes. Since the lower 
quartile new home price is not available, EPA estimated the lower-quartile price of a new home by adjusting the 
median new home prices. This adjustment was based on the proportional relationship between the median- and 
lower-quartile prices for existing homes. Since the 2006 ACS is a household survey, self-reporting bias may be 
present in the home price data. For example, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has noted that 
studies have found that owners may overestimate the values of their homes in government surveys by as much as 
eight percent (Kiel and Zable, 1999).30 However, the degree of over- or under-statement is likely to be small given 
that we are using values for new homes sold from 2005 - 2006. Since homeowners were reporting the value of a 
home they purchased within the previous year, it is not likely that homeowners would substantially err in 
estimating the value of their home. Other sources of new, single-family home price data are available from the 
Census; however, EPA identified the ACS data as the highest quality source given the relatively large sample size 
of approximately three million housing units and the additional benefit of being available for nearly 550 MSAs 
across the country.31 As noted above, obtaining MSA-level home price data significantly improves the analysis 
because it allows EPA to account for the very high variability in housing prices across and within states.32 
Table 3-9 reports the distribution – 5th percentile, 95th percentile – of newly constructed, single-family home 
prices from the set of median- and lower-quartile MSA prices used in the analysis. This table further illustrates the 
high variability in housing market prices – and therefore, critical income values – across and within states, and 
                                                     
30  It should be noted that the study by Kiel and Zable (1999) examined data from the Census-HUD American Housing Survey for years 
1978 – 1991. It is not clear whether and to what extent the observations of Kiel and Zable (1999) are also present in the American 
Community Survey. 
31  For example, the Census’ monthly Survey of Construction is an alternate source; however, this data are available only at the national 
level and by Census region. In addition, these data are based on a small sample, relative to ACS, of approximately 5,000 respondents 
representing 28,000 buildings. 
32  For example, among the 543 MSAs included in the analysis, median home prices in individual MSAs range from about $39,000 to just 
over $1,000,000.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology

highlights the desirability of performing this analysis at the MSA-level (as opposed to state or national-level 
analysis that ignores this variability).

The second step in estimating the baseline critical income values is to establish the monthly housing payment for 
the median- and lower-quartile priced new single-family home in each MSA. The baseline monthly housing 
payments are based on standard home-loan underwriting criteria and include the mortgage loan, property tax, and 
property insurance:  
¾ Estimate the monthly loan payment for purchase of new housing assuming that buyers finance 
approximately 80% of the home purchase price using a 30-year conventional fixed rate mortgage with an 
interest rate of 7.39%. The 80% loan to value ratio is derived from the Federal Housing Finance Board’s 
Terms on Conventional Single Family Mortgages, Fixed-Rate 30-Year and 15-Year Non-jumbo Loans 
average percentage (since 1990) of the financing amount to the total home purchase (FHFB, 2006). The 
7.39% interest rate is derived from Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey: Conventional, 
Conforming 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage Series Since 1971 average interest rate since 1990 (Freddie 
Mac, 2008). 
¾ Estimate monthly property taxes by determining the percent of the monthly property tax payment to the 
median and lower quartile new home value for each MSA. The 2006 ACS provides the median annual 
property tax payment for each MSA. The monthly value was compared to the median home value for 
each MSA to derive monthly property taxes as a percentage of the median home value. This same 
percentage was used to develop the monthly property tax payment for the lower quartile home price 
analysis.  
¾ Estimate the monthly insurance payment by determining the percent of the monthly insurance premium to 
the median and lower quartile new home value for each state. The Insurance Information Institute (III, 
2007) provides the average annual insurance premium for each state. The monthly premium was 
compared to the median home value for each state to derive the percent of the monthly insurance 
premium compared to the median home value. This same percentage was used to develop the monthly 
insurance premium for the lower quartile home price analysis. 
Private Mortgage Insurance is not included in the monthly payment calculation since this analysis assumes a loan 
to value ratio of 80%, which means that the loan would not require mortgage insurance. 
Using the above parameters, the monthly mortgage payment is calculated as follows:

Based on the FHA’s underwriting guidance that a homeowner’s total housing purchase payment should not 
exceed 29% of income (FHA, 2008), the calculation of total housing payment, as outlined above, supports the 
calculation of the annual income necessary to purchase a home at the median- and lower-quartile price for each 
MSA. Table 3-10 summarizes the key input parameters used in this part of the analysis.

3.4.2 Estimating the Change in New Single-Family Home Prices due to the Regulation 
The estimate of potential affordability effects – i.e., the change from baseline conditions due to the regulation – 
begins by calculating the increase in home prices due to the compliance costs of the proposed regulatory options 
and the new critical income values for the median- and lower-quartile-priced home, by MSA. For each regulatory 
option, the estimated price effect for each housing unit due to the rule’s compliance costs was applied as a direct 
add-on to the median- and lower-quartile new home price. 
The price change per single-family unit is calculated by first assigning state-specific compliance cost per acre 
values to each MSA. In approximately fifty instances, an MSA overlaps more than one state. In these cases, EPA 
allocated the households within the MSA to the separate states using county-level housing data from the U.S. 
Census. The Census provides the county names within each MSA (U.S. Census, 2007b) and, for approximately 
half of the counties, provides the number of households within the county. However, the Census did not report the 
number of households for counties with populations less than 65,000. Therefore, EPA used the 2006 Population 
Estimates for each county to estimate the number of households within these counties for which household counts 
were not available. For example, the Parkersburg-Marietta-Vienna, WV-OH MSA is spread among four counties, 
one in Ohio and three in West Virginia. Because these are relatively small counties, the Census only reported the 
number of households for one county in West Virginia. EPA estimated the number of households for each county 
by apportioning the total number of households in the MSA to the counties based on the proportion of the total 
MSA population in each county. This enables the total number of households in the MSA to be reasonably 
apportioned, in this example, between Ohio and West Virginia. 
The number of households within MSAs for each state was summed and compared to the total reported number of 
households for each state. In some instances – i.e. for those states in which all counties fall within an MSA – the 
number of households within the MSAs for each state equaled the total number of households for each state. 
However, in most instances, the number of households within the MSAs for each state was less than the total 
number of households for each state. For three states in which MSAs include more than one state and for which 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-38 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
EPA estimated the number of households for each state, the sum of households within the MSAs exceeded the 
reported total of households for the state. In these cases, the actual number of households by county (in lieu of the 
population proportions) was used to estimate the state-level number of households. Making this adjustment 
provides a better estimate of the number of households by state. Ultimately, EPA compared the total number of 
U.S. households found within MSAs to the total reported number of households by state, and found that 87% of 
all households fall within MSAs. 
Once all MSA households are appropriately assigned to states, EPA then assigned each MSA the state’s 
compliance cost per acre for each regulatory option. For regulatory options involving two sets of costs for in-
scope residential projects based, for example, on soil or rainfall characteristics, EPA calculated the weighted 
average of the two types of costs per-acre, by state, based on the number of residential acres estimated subject to 
regulation in each of the cost categories. Equation (10) shows this calculation.

LA1 =  Large Residential Number of Acres, Cost Set 1 
LC2  =  Large Residential Cost per Acre, Cost Set 2 
LA2 =  Large Residential Number of Acres, Cost Set 2 
EPA then converted the cost per acre by state, either the weighted average cost per acre or the standard residential 
cost per-acre, depending on the option, into a price effect per single-family home. The conversion is performed by 
dividing the cost per acre by the national median number of single-family units per acre – to estimate cost per 
unit – and then multiplying that cost per unit by the single-family project cost multiplier derived from the project-
level analysis (Section 3.2.3.2). Multiplying the cost by the previously estimated cost multiplier accounts for the 
possibility that cost increases at a single-family residential housing project can translate into an increase in the 
asking price of a new home by more than the direct compliance cost increase (see Section 3.2: Analysis of 
Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts). From the Census Bureau’s 2006 Characteristics of New Housing, 
the 2006 median number of units per acre (for both attached and detached single-family units) is 5.05. For the 
lower-quartile home price analysis, EPA also performed an alternative analysis where the cost per unit is based on 
the median number of units per acre for only attached single-family homes, which is approximately 14 units per 
acre. EPA performed this alternative analysis to account for the fact that lower-priced homes are more likely to be 
attached single-family homes and more likely to sit on lot sizes below the median of all single-family homes. In 
addition, Census data indicate that lot size generally declines as sales price declines and therefore the denser 
configuration of attached single-family homes may better represent a typical lot size for the lower priced homes 
(as opposed to the median lot size of both attached and detached homes). The results of this alternative analysis 
are discussed in Chapter 5. 
In using the lot size data from the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing, EPA recognized that these 
data sources do not account for road development associated with a building’s construction. As a result, the 
reported lot size values from these datasets would understate actual area subject to the regulation for any given 
housing unit. To address this omission, EPA applied a 13% multiplier to scale-up the lot size values to account for 
the typical road development “overhead” associated with new construction activity. EPA derived this multiplier 
from information in the Center for Watershed Protection’s Impervious Cover and Land Use in the Chesapeake 
Bay Watershed (Capiella, 2001).

3.4.3 Estimating the Number of Potentially Affected Single-Family Home Buyers 
After the median- and lower-quartile housing prices are adjusted to reflect the incremental compliance cost of the 
regulatory options, EPA then calculated the numbers of prospective home-purchasing households, for the median- 
and lower-quartile-priced home, by MSA, whose purchasing decision is potentially affected by the increase in 
housing price.  
To estimate the number of potentially affected households – i.e., those whose income is now below the new, post-
compliance critical income value for either the median- or lower-quartile priced home – EPA used household 
income distribution data from the American Community Survey’s 2006 Statistics of Household Income. The ACS 
reports the number of households falling in ten income ranges: $0-$10,000, $10,000-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999, 
$25,000-$34,999, $35,000-$49,999, $50,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, $100,000-$149,999, $150,000-$199,999, 
and $200,000 or more. 
Households in the income ranges below the range that contains the estimated critical income value are already 
considered to be unable to afford the home (e.g., median- or lower-quartile priced) in that MSA and therefore 
cannot experience an affordability effect for that particular home. The number of households present in the 
distribution below the range containing the critical income value is estimated as follows:

N Households ir = Number of households in Income Ranges ir below Income Range ir*  
The Census does not provide information on how household income is distributed within the Census-reported 
income ranges. In all likelihood, the critical income value necessary to qualify for mortgage will fall within, and 
not at the edge of, a Census income range. Accordingly, it is necessary to estimate the fraction of households 
within a Census income range that fall below the critical income value. For this analysis, EPA assumed that 
households are uniformly distributed over the income values within an income range. As a result, the fractional 
point at which the critical income value lies within an income range is also the fraction of households within that 
income range that fall below the critical income value.  
The uniform-distribution-of-households-within-range assumption inevitably involves error and could overstate or 
understate the fraction of households within an income range that fall below a critical income value, depending on 
the change in slope of the density distribution over the income range. Nevertheless, EPA considers the assumption 
of a uniform distribution with an income range to be a reasonable approach. The numbers of households that fall 
within the range containing the critical income value are estimated as shown within Equation (12).

The above steps produce an estimate of (1) the change in household income needed to qualify for financing to 
purchase the now-higher-priced housing unit and (2) the corresponding reduction in the number of households 
with income sufficient to be able to just purchase either the median- or lower-quartile housing unit in each MSA. 
In performing these calculations, EPA recognized that, at any given time, the number of households that are 
actually “in the market” for purchasing a home is significantly less than the number of households in an MSA. 
EPA further recognized that the number of these households whose purchasing decision might be practically 
affected – i.e., seek to purchase a new single-family house whose price is affected by a given regulatory option – 
is smaller again than the number of households seeking to purchase a home. Accordingly, in developing the 
estimates of potentially affected households, EPA reduced the numbers of households by income range in the total 
MSA household income distribution to account for these considerations. 
The only households that could practically experience an affordability effect from the regulation are those that are 
in the market for a newly, single-family home that would incur compliance costs under the regulation. To estimate 
the number of affected households, EPA first assumed that the potential market demand for new-construction 
single-family homes is essentially comprised of existing households who already own a single-family home. This 
reduced set of households potentially in the market actually understates the number of potential home buyers in 
any given year because it excludes non-homeowners (e.g., first-time home buyers). According to the 2006 
American Community Survey, approximately 65.5 million households live in owner-occupied single-family 
households. EPA then compared the number of owner-occupied single-family households with data describing the 
annual sales of new single-family homes to estimate the number of new, single-family home sales per owner-
occupied single-family household. The National Association of Realtors and the Census Bureau’s 2006 
Characteristics of New Housing reported approximately 6.7 million sales of new and existing single-family 
homes during 2006. Therefore, based on EPA’s assumption about households that comprise market demand for 
single-family homes, about 10 percent of all single-family homeowners were assumed to be in the market for a 
new or existing home during 2006. In addition, only about 15 percent (978,000) of the 6.7 million sales were sales 
of new single-family homes, implying a measure of about 0.015 new single-family home sales per owner-
occupied single-family household (i.e., 978,000 new home sales/65,500,000 households).  
The final step in this analysis is to further adjust the numerator in the above ratio to account for the fact that not 
all new single-family homes will be in-scope of the regulation and incur costs. To determine the number of new 
single family home sales that are expected to incur compliance costs, EPA estimated the percentage, for each 
regulatory option, of in-scope residential construction acreage to total residential construction acreage from the 
firm-level analysis (i.e., for businesses in NAICS sectors 236115, 236116, and 236117). These percentages were 
applied to the number of new single family home sales (978,000 in 2006) to estimate approximately the number 
of new, single-family homes likely to incur compliance costs under each regulatory option. From this calculation, 
the number of new, single-family homes that are in-scope and incur cost is estimated to be approximately 205,000 
for Option 1, 513,000 for Option 2, and 879,000 for Option 3.  
EPA then used these option-specific estimates of the numerator value – the number of in-scope single-family 
home sales estimated to be affected by the regulatory option – to determine the fraction of total households whose

purchasing decision could be practically affected by a regulatory option.33 Table 3-11 summarizes the calculation 
of the option-specific, in-scope multipliers. As shown in Table 3-11, the fraction of total households, by 
regulatory option, whose purchasing decisions and capability could be practically affected by the regulatory 
options is quite small – reflecting the considerations of likelihood (1) that the household would be in the market to 
purchase a home and (2) that the home purchased would be a new home that would incur costs (and price effect) 
under the C&D rule options.

In the analysis for each regulatory option, EPA used these fractions to calculate the number of potentially affected 
households by applying these option-specific multipliers to the estimated change – from baseline to post-
compliance – in the number of households whose income is sufficient to purchase the median- and lower-quartile 
new single-family home.34 Chapter 5 reports the findings from that analysis by regulatory option.  
3.5 Analysis of Social Cost 
Markets vary in the level of activity, structure of the industry, and ultimately cost pass-through potential, from 
state to state and region to region. The modeling approach described in this section captures such regional 
variation in the impacts of the proposed regulatory options by estimating partial equilibrium (PE) models at the 
state level for each building construction sector (single-family, multi-family, commercial, and industrial). 
EPA applied the PE models using national-level estimates of the elasticity of market supply and demand to 
estimate the impact of incremental costs on the supply curve and, thus, on prices and quantities of 
construction products under post-compliance conditions. In this framework, part of the increased costs may 
raise the price of new housing, with the balance of increased costs being absorbed by the builder, depending on 
the relative elasticities of supply and demand. A PE analysis assumes that the proposed regulation will only 
directly affect a single industry; in this case, the construction and development industry. Holding other industries 
“constant” in this way is generally appropriate since the compliance costs of the proposed regulatory options are 
expected to result in only marginal changes in prices and quantities and the Rule does not directly affect the other 
industries (HUD, 2006). 
Economic impacts in the directly affected industry can trigger further output and employment effects in the 
broader U.S. economy via inter-industry linkages. For the industries indirectly affected by the proposed rule, a 
multi-sector input-output or general equilibrium modeling approach is more appropriate (HUD, 2006). A 
                                                     
33  Ideally, this analysis would include the number of new home sales and owner-occupied units for both the single-family and multi-
family residential sectors. However, the number of new home sales is only available for the single family residential sector. Since the 
data is not available to adjust the both the numerator and denominator, EPA opted to only include single-family residential sector data 
in the metric estimates. 
34 The multipliers are also applied to the figures in Appendix 6-2, which presents the results for the top 15 MSA’s affected for each 
option.

3-42 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
traditional approach for assessing such cross-industry effects is the input-output (I/O) modeling concept. For its 
analysis of the C&D regulation, EPA used input-output-based multipliers to estimate the indirect impacts on 
economic output and employment in the broader U.S. economy. The PE analysis of state- and national-level 
economic impacts includes five broad steps: 
1. Establish the baseline market equilibrium for each construction sector at the state-level 
2. Establish the post-compliance market equilibrium for each construction sector at the state-level after 
accounting for compliance costs of the proposed regulatory options; this produces an estimate of the 
change in the quantity of C&D market output. 
3. Estimate the total resource cost of the proposed regulatory options and the value of lost C&D output, after 
adjusting for the quantity effect of the proposed options, for each state. 
4. Aggregate the resource cost (an increase in demand for society’s resources) and lost economic output (a 
reduction in demand for society’s resources) across states to obtain a national-level estimate of direct 
economic impacts; and, 
5. Apply national-level total requirements multipliers, derived from national input-output tables, to the 
resource cost of the regulation and the direct change in C&D output to estimate the total inter-industry 
economic value and employment effects of the proposed options. 
The remainder of this section is organized as follows: 
¾ Section 3.5.1 presents the methodology for estimating each PE market model;

C&D output, and the dead weight loss for each regulatory option; and 
3.5.1 Description of the Partial Equilibrium C&D Market Models 
This section describes the methodology for estimating the partial equilibrium market model; that is, the pre- and 
post-compliance market equilibrium for a given C&D sector. This methodology is applied separately to each 
building construction sector and estimated for each state within the four sector-specific models. Inputs to the 
partial equilibrium framework vary across construction sectors, and are discussed in Section 3.5.2. 
3.5.1.1 Estimating the Baseline Construction Market Equilibrium 
EPA assumes a linear partial equilibrium market model. The assumption that compliance costs of the proposed 
regulatory options will result in only small marginal changes in prices and quantities provides the basis for 
assuming that the supply and demand curves are linear in the relevant range of market effect. The data inputs 
required to estimate the baseline market equilibrium for each model include the baseline construction unit price 
(e.g., the price of a single-family home), the baseline quantity of construction activity (e.g., the number of new 
single-family housing units constructed), and the assumed elasticities of supply and demand for the construction 
sector being analyzed. The intersection of the baseline quantity and baseline price serves as the baseline market 
equilibrium. 
The baseline supply curve for a given construction market in a given state can be approximated by: 
Ρ+= βαsQ  (13)
Where:

EPA assumes that the baseline condition for each market being analyzed is in equilibrium, and so, the initial 
supply and demand quantity values (Qs and Qd) in these two equations are equal. 
3.5.1.2 Estimating the Post-Compliance Construction Market Equilibrium 
The incremental unit cost of compliance to comply with the proposed regulatory options increases builders’ costs 
and causes an upward shift the supply curve (and creating a new, “shocked” supply intercept). This shift drives 
changes in prices, which increase, and quantities, which decrease. A key assumption in the model is that the 
changes in production cost on the supply side are not enough to change the price elasticities or substitution on the 
demand side. In effect, the supply curve shifts by the amount of the per unit incremental compliance costs – 
including adjustments for debt cost and equity cost - without any change in the demand curve. 
The post-compliance supply intercept (αs) is given by: 
)( 00 ESCQs +Ρ−= βα  (15)
 
Where, ESC is the per unit incremental cost of compliance (marked-up by the project-level compliance cost 
multiplier to account for debt cost and equity cost considerations).  
The new construction market price (PN) is then given by:

The cost pass-through rate is the ratio of the elasticity of supply divided by the difference in the elasticity of 
supply and the elasticity of demand (Es/(Es - Ed)). The cost pass-through rate can also be calculated by dividing 
the change in the price of a construction unit in the market by the adjusted per unit incremental cost of compliance 
((PN – P0)/ESC). 
3.5.2 Inputs to the Partial Equilibrium C&D Market Models 
EPA estimated the above partial equilibrium model for four building construction sectors: single-family 
residential, multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial construction. The data sources for each model are 
discussed in the sub-sections below. 
3.5.2.1 Construction Market Quantity 
Residential 
The quantity of new residential construction in the single and multi-family construction sectors is measured by the 
number of new units authorized. The U.S. Census reports the number of new single and multi-family units 
authorized by permits on an annual basis at the state level. EPA used each state’s average annual number of new 
single and multi-family housing units authorized for the years 2002 – 2007 as the measure of baseline quantity.  
Non-Residential 
Since the Census Bureau discontinued collection of non-residential building permit information in 1994, EPA 
sought an alternative measure of new non-residential construction activity to serve as the quantity metric for the 
PE models. In the absence of other information, EPA has opted to use the baseline average annual quantity of 
commercial and industrial acreage developed according to the NLCD data described in detail in Chapter 4. 
Referred to as the “top-down” estimate of developed acreage, the NLCD data indicate that approximately 590,000 
acres of land are newly developed annually across all construction sectors (U.S. EPA, 2008). EPA interprets these 
data as representing the total quantity of acreage developed annually on sites of at least one acre and therefore 
potentially within the scope of the regulatory options that were considered in developing the C&D propose rule. 
EPA used Notice of Intent (NOI) data for permits under the Stormwater Regulation to disaggregate the NLCD 
acreage among sectors and states (U.S. EPA, 2008). EPA spread the 590,000 total acres among three construction 
activity categories: (1) residential building, approximately 287,000 acres; (2) non-residential building, 248,000 
acres, and (3) transportation, 55,000 acres. The NOI data were also used to estimate acreage, for the residential 
and non-residential building sectors, in two size categories that were important in defining and estimating the 
impact of regulatory options: (1) small projects – 1 to 10 acres; and (2) large projects – 10 or more acres. 
Additionally, state level breakouts were provided according to the NOI data. 
To use the NLCD acreage estimates in this PE analysis required further disaggregating the state-level non-
residential acreage values into the commercial and industrial sector. EPA based this sector-level disaggregation on 
information from the Census Bureau’s 2006 Characteristics of New Housing and from Reed Construction Data.

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-45 
The detailed methodology for establishing the baseline acreage for the commercial and industrial sectors is 
detailed in Chapter 4. 
3.5.2.2 Construction Market Price 
Residential 
The state-level median price of new single-family homes serves as the baseline price in the single-family market 
model. The U.S. Census American Community Survey 2006 reports the median price, at the state-level, for owner-
occupied units constructed since 2005. 
Separate price series for multi-family housing units are not reported by the Census. EPA instead calculated the 
ratio of multi-family housing unit prices to single-family housing unit prices using data available from the 
National Association of Realtors (NAR). The NAR’s Metropolitan Area Existing-Home Prices data series 
includes data for existing single-family home sales as well as sales prices for condos by metro market. EPA 
calculated a weighted-average value of the ratio of multi-family unit prices to single-family unit prices of 
approximately 68%. This ratio was used to adjust the state-level median single-family home price series published 
by the Census to approximate 2006 multi-family unit prices for each state. 
Commercial 
Rental rates, in dollars per square foot per year, are closely watched indicators of demand for commercial space 
and serve as the price for the commercial market model. 
Grubb & Ellis reports rental rates for Class A and Class B office space for 75 metropolitan areas in the United 
States (Grubb & Ellis, 2007). Rental rate data refer to asking rents for space that is available on the market at the 
end of the third quarter of 2007. Rates are per square foot, quoted on an annual basis. Rates for each available 
suite are weighted by the size of the building in which the suite is located. Grubb & Ellis adheres to the BOMA35 
guidelines for office building classifications. Class A properties are the most prestigious buildings competing for 
premier office users with rents above average for the area, Class B properties compete for a wide range of users 
with rents in the average range for the area, and Class C buildings (not reported) compete for tenants requiring 
functional space at rents below the area average. 
Grubb & Ellis also reports rental rates for retail market space in 51 metropolitan areas in the United States (Grubb 
& Ellis, 2007). Rental rate data refer to in-line shop space in a grocery-anchored center, 3,000-square-foot 
national credit tenant, newly developing suburban trade area, first generation space, white-box build-out. Rates 
are per square foot, quoted on an annual basis. 
EPA estimated the average commercial space rental rate in each state as the average of Class A, Class B, and 
retail rates across all of the metropolitan areas reported for each state. EPA used the average rental rate for other 
states in the same Census division for states for which no metropolitan areas are reported. There are 15 states with 
no reported data: Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, North Dakota, 
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 
In order to use this data describing the average “annual rental rate per square foot per year” as the metric of the 
price of commercial space in the PE model, EPA had to convert this rate into units of “annual rental rate per acre 
per year.” This is required because EPA is using the quantity of commercial acreage developed per year as the 
quantity metric. To convert the “per square foot” value for commercial space into a “per acre” value, EPA used 
the Reed Construction database to estimate the average quantity of commercial square footage constructed on any

given acre land developed for commercial purposes. This value, estimated to be approximately 14,200 square feet 
per acre, is multiplied by the Grubb & Ellis rental rate to estimate an annual commercial rental price per acre per 
year for each state. 
Industrial 
Rental rates, in dollars per square foot per year, are closely watched indicators of demand for industrial space and 
serve as the price for the industrial market model. 
Grubb & Ellis reports rental rates for industrial space classified as “warehouse-distribution” or “R&D-flex” in 69 
and 66 metropolitan areas in the United States, respectively (Grubb & Ellis, 2007). Rental rate data refer to space 
that is available on the market at the end of the third quarter 2007. Rates for available space are expressed in 
dollars per square foot per year in most parts of the country and dollars per square foot per month in areas of 
California and selected other markets. EPA is working to identify the specific markets in which the data are 
reported on a monthly basis so that we can convert the values to an annual basis. 
EPA estimated the average industrial space rental rate in each state as the average of the two data series across all 
of the metropolitan areas reported for each state. EPA used the average rental rate for other states in the same 
Census division for states for which no metropolitan areas are reported. There are 17 states with no reported data: 
Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North 
Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 
As with the commercial rental price data, in order to use this data describing the average “annual rental rate per 
square foot per year” as the metric of the price of industrial space in the PE model, EPA had to convert this rate 
into units of “annual rental rate per acre per year.” This is required because EPA is using the quantity of industrial 
acreage developed per year as the quantity metric. To convert the “per square foot” value for industrial space into 
a “per acre” value, EPA used the Reed Construction database to estimate the average quantity of industrial square 
footage constructed on any given acre land developed for industrial purposes. This value, estimated to be 
approximately 12,700 square feet per acre, is multiplied by the Grubb & Ellis rental rate to estimate an annual 
industrial rental price per acre per year for each state. 
3.5.2.3 Incremental Compliance Cost Effect per Construction Unit 
Each state-level construction market is shocked with the estimated compliance costs associated with the proposed 
regulatory options. The residential PE market models require compliance costs on a per-construction-unit basis in 
order to be consistent with the measures of price and quantity in the market models. In addition, the incremental 
compliance costs per construction unit must be adjusted to account for the additional costs beyond the direct 
compliance outlay (e.g., cost of financing) associated with each unit of construction. Consequently, the final 
magnitude of the shift in the supply curve for each construction market will be greater than simply the 
incremental compliance costs for a given residential unit or non-residential acre. The non-residential PE market 
models require compliance costs in terms of a per-acre annual rent-recovery value since the price metric is rent 
per acre and the quantity metric is acres of non-residential development. These compliance cost concepts are 
detailed below. 
Residential 
The total state-level dollar value of price effect per housing unit (i.e., the magnitude of supply curve shift) in the 
single and multi-family market models is measured by the adjusted incremental compliance cost per unit of single 
or multi-family housing. The price effect for each state is given by:

COSTx = Indirect project cost multiplier from the project-level analysis framework, which 
indicates the dollar change in the price of a housing unit for each dollar of 
incremental compliance cost, after accounting for overhead, debt cost, and 
equity cost considerations. 
Non-Residential 
The total state-level dollar value of price effect (i.e., magnitude of supply curve shift) in the commercial and 
industrial market models needs to be a measure of the incremental increase in the annual rental price for an acre’s-
worth of new commercial and/or industrial space, given the price and quantity metrics previously outlined. EPA 
therefore converts the non-residential incremental compliance cost per acre for each state and regulatory option 
into an annualized value to be recovered through rent over the useful life of the commercial or industrial property. 
This approach is appropriate because the developer of new commercial or industrial space will not attempt to 
recover the entirety of the incremental compliance cost every year, nor will the developer attempt to recover the 
cost though a single year’s rental fee since that could presumably increase the rental price to such an extent that 
the property is less attractive relative to other available properties for potential renters. 
EPA calculates the annual compliance cost recovery value for each state and option by amortizing the incremental 
per-acre cost assuming a 20-year recovery period, a 7% cost of debt, 13.54% cost of equity, and 75% loan-to-
value ratio (i.e., 75% of the cost is financed through debt, 25% using developer equity). Such expenditures on 
non-residential property development would be depreciated over a 39-year useful life; however, EPA has 
alternatively assumed a more aggressive 20-year recovery period to be conservative in the analysis. 
3.5.2.4 Elasticity of Supply 
A review of the literature indicates that, in contrast to demand elasticity research, less is known about the 
behavior of supply (HUD, 2006). There are three key empirical difficulties identified in the housing supply 
elasticity literature. First, estimated housing supply elasticities vary widely. Second, price does not seem to be a 
sufficient statistic, and other market indicators are quite important in explaining supply (e.g., land availability, 
land-use and other regulatory restrictions, and demographic characteristics). Third, construction levels seem to 
respond quite sluggishly to construction costs and output prices (DiPasquale, 1999; Hwang and Quigley, 2006; 
Green, Malpezzi and Mayo, 2005). 
EPA’s review of the literature indicates that the supply of residential and non-residential construction space is 
generally elastic, although there can be significant variability across specific markets or regions. For example, an 
MSA-level analysis of residential supply elasticity found statistically significant elasticity values ranging from 
1.43 – 21.6 (Green, Malpezzi and Mayo, 2005). Green, Malpezzi and Mayo (2005) estimate separate supply 
elasticities for individual U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) using annual data for 45 MSAs and over 18 
years (1979-1996). Their analysis developed 45 first-stage regressions to recover supply elasticities for the MSAs, 
where the dependent variable in each regression is the number of housing units for which building permits were 
issued, multiplied by an average household size of 2.5, divided by population (e.g., %DQ) and the independent 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-48 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
variable is the lagged first difference in the natural logs of the Fannie Mae repeat-sales index of house prices for 
the MSA. The resulting estimated supply elasticities were found to be statistically significant and greater than 
zero in 22 of 45 cases. Based on the results in Green, Malpezzi and Mayo (2005), EPA assumed that 4.01 is a 
reasonable assumption for the price elasticity of residential supply. 
For non-residential construction, EPA has referred to the analysis of Benjamin, Jud, and Winkler (1998), which 
similarly analyzed price elasticity at the MSA-level. Their analysis employed data for 19 MSAs covering years 
1986 – 1995. Based on the statistically significant results of Benjamin, Jud and Winkler (1998), EPA has assumed 
a non-residential price elasticity value of 0.49. 
3.5.2.5 Elasticity of Demand 
Estimates of the price elasticity of demand for both residential and non-residential construction are more 
consistent within the literature relative to estimates of the price elasticity of supply. A key factor that determines 
demand elasticity in a given market is the availability of close substitutes. If a homebuyer has the option of 
substituting existing housing, rental housing, other new housing, or manufactured housing, demand will be 
relatively more elastic. On the other hand, housing is a necessity, which tends to make demand inelastic (HUD, 
2006). A review of the literature indicates a somewhat inelastic demand for new housing and non-residential 
space (HUD, 2006; DiPasquale, 1999; Benjamin, Jud and Winkler, 1998), ranging nationally from about -0.1 to -
1.0. Based on the literature, EPA has assumed a residential price elasticity of demand of -0.7, and a price 
elasticity of non-residential demand of -0.2.  
3.5.3 Estimating the Resource Cost, Deadweight Loss, and Output Loss Due to the Proposed 
Rule 
Section 3.3 – Analysis of Firm- and Industry-Level Economic Impacts described EPA’s estimation of the first 
order resource cost of compliance within each C&D industry sector and for each of the proposed regulatory 
options. This estimate of resource cost produced in the firm-level analysis, however, does not account for the 
potential affect of the proposed options on the quantity of construction activity/units performed in the various 
C&D markets. The PE analysis considers the potential for the proposed regulatory options to shift the supply 
curve up in each market (i.e., via increased production costs), resulting in a higher price per unit and, depending 
on market response, a lower quantity of output. A primary output of the PE analysis is to estimate the change in 
market quantity expected on average in each market. EPA estimated this quantity-effect using the methodology 
outlined above for calculating the pre- and post-compliance market equilibrium. The estimated change in quantity 
is then used not only to adjust the firm-level resource cost for the quantity-effect of the regulation, but also to 
compute the direct output (revenue) changes in the construction industry sectors themselves. The resource cost 
and output loss, in turn, have ripple effects in the rest of the economy, which are measured using input-output 
multipliers developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Section 3.6. 
3.5.3.1 Estimating Resource Cost and Deadweight Loss 
Adjusting the firm-level estimation of resource cost for the anticipated C&D market-effect of the proposed 
regulatory options is relatively simple. EPA reduces the state-level estimate of resource cost from the firm 
analysis by the anticipated percentage change in the quantity of output with each state estimated by the PE market 
model.

RCUn-adj = Unadjusted, firm-level measure of resource cost in each state and market 
%∆Q = Percentage change in state-level quantity of construction from baseline to post-
compliance from the PE analysis 
 
The diagram below (which exaggerates the magnitude of the market impact for purposes of illustration) shows 
conceptually these alternate measures of resource cost. The firm-level analysis previously outlined is essentially 
estimating a measure of resource cost equal to the sum of area A, B, C, D, E, and F in the diagram; it is a measure 
of resource cost that assumed the quantity of C&D industry output does not change as a result of the cost of the 
proposed rule. However, the PE analysis indicates that, given the relationship between supply and demand, the 
upward shift in the supply curve in a given C&D market will result in a post-compliance market equilibrium with 
a lower quantity of production, and each unit of production has a higher price. Therefore, the true resource cost of 
compliance, accounting for this quantity-effect, is the sum of areas A, B, and C. The difference between the un-
adjusted and adjusted measure of resource cost is captured by the sum of areas D, E, and F. Areas D and E 
represent the deadweight loss (DWL) of the proposed rule for a given C&D sector, which is simply one-half of 
the sum of areas D, E, and F since EPA has assumed linear supply and demand curves in the PE model. 
The PE model has a number of implications for the welfare of society. When the supply curve shifts as a result of 
incremental compliance costs, consumers lose some of their benefits from the product in absorbing those 
compliance costs. The result is a change in consumer surplus, part of which eventually makes its way to the 
entities whose services are purchased to implement the requirements of the rule, and part of which becomes the 
consumer contribution to the dead weight loss of the proposed rule. There is also a change in producer surplus. 
Some producer surplus is similarly transferred to other producers whose services are purchased to implement the 
regulation due the partial absorption of compliance costs, and another portion of producer surplus is contributes 
the dead weight loss of the rule. 
EPA estimates the adjusted resource cost and DWL for each C&D building sector, state, and proposed regulatory 
option. EPA assumes inelastic demand in the C&D non-building sector, and therefore assumes no quantity effect 
or DWL and uses the firm-level analysis measure of resource cost for the non-building sector. The sum of 
resource cost and DWL across all states and C&D markets is the total social cost of the regulation36.  
 
                                                     
36  Traditionally the social cost would also include government administrative and monitoring costs; however EPA does not expect any 
additional administrative or monitoring costs associated with the proposed rule.

3.5.3.2 Estimating the Loss in C&D Output 
EPA estimates the state-level change in C&D industry revenues for each of the four C&D building sectors by 
multiplying the baseline construction unit price by the difference between the pre- and post-compliance quantity 
of construction units: 
0Ρ∗∆= QRloss  (20)
Where: 
Rloss = Decline in revenue for the C&D sector in a given state 
∆Q = Change in state-level quantity of construction from baseline to post-compliance 
(QN – Q0) 
P0 = Baseline state-level construction unit price 
The sum of the C&D output loss across all states and C&D markets is the total value of output loss associated 
with each regulatory option.  
3.5.3.3 Price-Effect in C&D Markets 
As noted above and illustrated in the above figure, the PE analysis indicates that, given the relationship between 
supply and demand, the upward shift in the supply curve in a given C&D market will result in a post-compliance 
market equilibrium with a lower quantity of production, and a higher price per unit of production. It is important 
to note, however, that the expected increase in market price is actually less than the magnitude of the vertical shift 
in the supply curve. The supply curve shifts upward by the amount of the per unit compliance cost, but – as seen 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-51 
the figure above – the supply and demand elasticity responses to this compliance cost result in a quantity-
reduction that causes the price to ultimately rise by less than the amount of compliance cost. 
In the following section, the aggregate measures of C&D output loss and total resource cost are separately 
analyzed in an input-output framework to estimate the total (e.g., direct and indirect) economic impacts of the 
proposed regulatory options. 
3.6 Analysis of Economy-Wide Economic Effects 
There are also economy-wide effects that arise from both the resource cost of compliance outlays and the direct 
decrease in C&D industry output loss estimated for each regulatory option. The resource cost outlays to comply 
with the proposed rule will require the production of services from those sectors that provide the services needed 
for compliance. Those sectors, in turn, require inputs from a myriad of other sectors to produce any given unit of 
output. The increased economic activity derived from the outlays required for compliance should be thought of as 
the total increase in the demand for society’s resources necessary for compliance to occur, where, the value-added 
component of all the increased activity is equal to the resource cost of compliance. Although this value is a 
positive number, it is not a “benefit” of the rule, but rather, a measure of the sum of inter-industry transfers that 
arise from the compliance outlays required by the regulation. 
The loss in C&D industry output also produces inter-industry economic effects. In this case, the reduction in C&D 
output means fewer materials and services are required from sectors in the economy that typically provide inputs 
to the C&D sector. Those sectors, in turn, require fewer inputs from the sectors that supply them. It is important to 
emphasize that neither set of inter-industry economic effects (i.e., resource cost-related or output loss-related 
impacts) is the social cost of the regulation. Rather, these effects are manifestations of social cost. 
3.6.1 Economy-Wide Economic Effects Arising from Resource Cost of Compliance Outlays 
3.6.1.1 Resource Cost Impacts on Economic Output 
The resource cost of compliance represents the dollar value of goods and services that will be purchased from 
sectors that make or install the environmental controls or provide other services related to regulatory compliance. 
EPA estimates that approximately 45% of these services will be provided by engineering service firms, 40% will 
be provided by firms related to the production or rental of water treatment equipment, and about 15% of the 
resource cost will be used to purchase chemicals for treatment. 
As the first step in estimating the inter-industry output impacts of each option, EPA allocated the total estimated 
resource cost for each option to these three key industries. EPA next used total requirements I-O multipliers from 
BEA for these three key industry sectors to estimate the total economy effects of the purchases of goods and 
services required for regulatory compliance.37 BEA’s total requirements multipliers show the dollar value of 
inputs required by each of these three industries from 66 other industries in the national economy to produce a 
dollar of output. Multiplying the vector of I-O multipliers for each key industry sector by its assigned proportion 
of resource cost yields the total value of economic activity associated with providing the services necessary for 
compliance with the option being analyzed. The sum of the multiplier effects across the three key industry sectors 
is the aggregate, national inter-industry economic output effect due to the resource cost of the regulation. Since 
                                                     
37  EPA “mapped” these three key industry sectors to BEA’s industry definitions by selecting the Professional, Scientific, and Technical 
services industry to represent the engineering service firms, the Chemical Production industry to represent the chemical purchases, and 
the Machinery Manufacturing industry to represent the water treatment machinery required by the proposed options. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-52 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
the regulatory options require outlays and additional economic activity from society, this is a positive number 
(but not a benefit).  
3.6.1.2 Resource Cost Impacts on Employment 
EPA also estimated the potential number of jobs that might be associated with the additional economic activity 
required to produce the services for regulatory compliance. To estimate the potential employment effects, EPA 
required two sets of data for the three key industry sectors: 
¾ BEA direct requirements I-O multipliers for employee compensation, which indicate the dollar value of 
employee compensation required from industries that provide inputs to the three key industry sectors in 
order for the key industry sector to produce a dollar of output. 
¾ Economic Census data for all industries indicating the number of employees in the industry for every 
dollar of employee compensation. 
To estimate the number of jobs potentially affected by each option, EPA first converted the economic output 
multiplier effect in each industry into an equivalent employee compensation value using the direct requirements 
multipliers. Next, EPA converted the dollar value of employee compensation into a quantity of jobs using the 
Economic Census data multipliers. These economy-wide employment effects that stem from the resource cost of 
regulatory compliance should not be interpreted as a benefit of the regulation. These employment effects are 
simply another way of representing the cost of the rule. That is, the employment effects reflect the labor 
requirements – both in the directly affected industries and economically linked industries – of supplying the goods 
and services that are needed for regulatory compliance.  
3.6.2 Economy-Wide Economic Effects Arising from the Direct Loss in C&D Industry Output  
The compliance-induced reduction in C&D output means that the C&D industry purchases fewer inputs from 
other economic sectors compared to the pre-compliance level of activity. The value of this reduction in purchases 
from other sectors is represented by the direct change in C&D output calculated above in 3.5.3.2. When the C&D 
industry reduces the value of purchases from other sectors, those sectors, in turn, require fewer inputs from the 
sectors that supply them. 
EPA estimated the national, inter-industry economic output and potential employment impacts associated with the 
direct reduction of output in the C&D industry using the same methodology as 3.6.1, except that this analysis uses 
multipliers for the C&D industry itself. The resulting measures of inter-industry economic activity and number of 
jobs are negative numbers since they are associated with a reduction in economic activity. This total economy 
effect represents the total reduction in demand for society’s economic resources resulting from the estimated 
contraction in C&D industry output.  
3.7 Future Projections of Compliance Cost and Acreage 
As previously documented in this chapter and Chapter 2 – Economic Profile of the Construction and 
Development Industry, EPA’s primary economic analysis is performed for a single industry snap-shot year, 2002. 
As a result, the magnitude of compliance cost and acreage developed from the economic analysis described thus 
far in this chapter reflect the level of activity in the C&D industry during 2002. The purpose of this section is to 
outline EPA’s approach for projecting forward the estimated quantity of compliance acreage – and therefore, cost 
– to more accurately reflect the industry’s anticipated activity level during 2010, when the rule begins, and 
beyond. In so doing, EPA also takes into consideration the expected “phase-in” of compliance across over the first 
five years after promulgation as states renew their Construction General Permits (CGP) over the five years 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-53 
following rule promulgation (i.e., not all states will renew their CGP during 2010; compliance will therefore 
phase in from 2010 through 2014). 
Overall, the construction industry is expected to experience continuing weakness until residential markets work 
through the current inventory of unsold homes and credit markets and the general economy returns to a better 
condition. Nevertheless, as previously summarized in the profile chapter, recent forecasts suggest that the industry 
will return to better performance during 2010 – 2011 timeframe. 
3.7.1 Projecting Aggregate C&D Industry Activity into the Future 
To project forward the expected compliance acreage and cost from the year 2002 to 2010 and beyond, EPA began 
with the time series of the total value of construction (in constant 2008 dollars) developed in the profile chapter. 
This time series is based on data from the BEA up to the year 2006 and industry forecast data from Global Insight 
for years 2007 through 2012 (BEA 2008b and 2008c and Global Insight January 2008). The other key required 
parameter for this projection is the total quantity of developed acreage in the base year, 2002, which is estimated 
from NLCD data to be approximately 590,000 acres (see Chapter 4 for additional detail on how this baseline 
acreage value was developed). 
Using the aggregate industry data for 2002 (e.g., total value of construction and quantity of acreage), EPA 
estimated an acreage intensity value for 2002 by dividing the quantity of developed acreage by the total value of 
construction. Acreage intensity is interpreted as the quantity of acreage developed per dollar of construction 
value. As the next step in developing the projection of industry activity, EPA estimated the time series of 
developed acreage that aligns with the time series of the value of construction from 2002 to 2012. EPA estimated 
the quantity of acreage developed in each year from 2002 to 2012 by multiplying the base-year acreage intensity 
value by the total value of construction. This calculation assumes acreage intensity is constant over the time 
period 2002 to 2012. Next, EPA extended this time series of aggregate industry construction value and 
compliance acreage to the year 2025. EPA extended the time series by assuming a uniform annual growth rate in 
aggregate construction value from 2012 to 2025 of 2.7% per year. This value is based on the industry’s long-term 
average annual growth rate of construction value from Census’ value of construction data for the period 1964 to 
2007. After projecting construction value to 2025, EPA then estimated the quantity of developed acreage in each 
year continuing to assume constant acreage intensity (i.e., construction value times acreage intensity equals 
acreage). 
The resulting time series of aggregate industry activity is presented in Table 3-12.

3.7.2 Projecting Total Social Cost and Compliance Acreage into the Future 
EPA used the above data along with the estimated total social cost and compliance acreage estimates based on the 
2002 industry snap-shot for each regulatory option to estimate social cost and compliance acreage from 2010 to 
2025. 
The first step in the cost projection analysis for each option is to estimate the total social cost and compliance 
acreage for each year from 2010 through 2014 based on the 2002 snap-shot of industry activity. These estimates 
of social cost and acreage are produced using the same firm-level, and subsequently, social cost analysis 
methodologies described in Sections 3.3 and 3.5. EPA used the firm-level and social cost analysis methodologies 
along with specific information about which states come into compliance during each year from 2010 to 2014 to 
produce these annual estimates of cost and acreage – again, based on 2002 industry activity.38 
The next step in the analysis is to scale up the estimated social cost and acreage in 2010 to 2014 to account for the 
anticipated change in industry activity between 2002 and those future years. These values were estimated by 
multiplying the 2002-based social cost and compliance acreage – for each year 2010 – 2014 – by the percentage 
change in total construction value and developed acreage from 2002 to each projection year. EPA essentially 
scaled the social cost and compliance acreage in any given year in proportion to the total value of construction 
and developed acreage in that year. For example, social cost in 2010 adjusted for the expected level of industry 
activity in 2010, is calculated as follows: 
                                                     
38  EPA expects that costs will “phase in” over the first five years after promulgation as states renew their CGPs over the five years 
following rule promulgation (i.e., not all states will renew their CGP during 2009; compliance will therefore phase-in from 2009 
through 2013).

CV2010 = Projected total construction value in 2009

EPA used this approach to adjust the 2010 – 2014 social cost and acreage estimates to adjust for the expected 
change in industry activity from 2002 to each of those five respective years. This process resulted in estimates of 
total social cost and compliance acreage for 2010 – 2014 that properly reflect the anticipated phase-in of states – 
where 2014 is the first year of 100% compliance – and changes in aggregate C&D industry activity. 
Using estimated social cost and acreage for 2014 as a starting point, EPA then projected social and acreage out to 
the year 2025 using the same general approach. That is, scaling cost and acreage in any given year in proportion 
to the percentage change in the value of construction and developed acreage from 2014 to that year. 
Lastly, EPA estimated the annualized value of social cost over the period 2010 – 2025 using both 3% and 7% 
discounting rates. 
3.8 Key Sources of Uncertainty and Limitations 
This section highlights the primary sources of uncertainty and limitations in the cost and economic impact 
analysis approaches presented in this chapter. The review of these uncertainties and limitations is organized 
according to the analysis concept to which they refer. This section is not intended to be an exhaustive re-iteration 
of all assumptions and potential sources of error introduced into the analysis, but rather, to highlight those that 
EPA judges to be of most consequence. 
3.8.1 Analysis of Project-Level Costs and Economic Impacts 
¾ Determinants of the Compliance Cost Multiplier. The parameters that determine the project-level 
compliance cost multiplier is substantially uncertain (see Section 3.2.3.2). The multiplier represents a 
mark-up, per dollar of compliance, and is determined by the financing terms specified for the model 
projects, including: 
 Debt cost 
 Equity cost 
 Loan to value ratios, and 
 Durations of each phase of development and the associated financing for these phases. 
To the extent that these parameters vary from the model parameter values for actual in-scope construction 
projects, EPA may be overstating or understating the cost multiplier.  
3.8.2 Analysis of Firm- and Industry-Level Economic Impacts 
EPA has addressed some of the key uncertainties present in the firm and industry level analysis economic analysis 
for the proposed rule by performing this analysis under two plausible alternative assumptions of business 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-56 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
conditions for C&D firms and the overall industry: the primary analysis case and the adverse analysis case (see 
Section 3.3.4.1). 
However, within both of these overall analysis configurations, additional key sources of uncertainty and 
limitations remain. EPA is continuing to acquire data and develop analysis approaches to address the remaining 
uncertainties to the extent possible. These uncertainties and considerations are summarized below with reference 
to the more detailed discussions in previous sections of this chapter for more information: 
¾ Determination of In-Scope Model Firm Revenue and Construction Activity. Four key sources of 
uncertainty affect EPA’s determination of the fraction of firm revenue and construction activity estimated 
to be in-scope of the regulation: 
 The Likelihood that Firms’ Activities Would Incur Direct Compliance Costs. There is uncertainty 
with respect to the business configurations for performance of construction projects in which the rule 
will impose direct costs on C&D firms. Large construction projects, in particular, can be performed 
by multiple firms and those firms can be organized in multiple business configurations for any given 
project. For example, a single developer can sell “pieces” of a project to other independent firms. 
Under this configuration, the single developer would incur the direct costs of the regulation (the 
subsequent lot purchases may then incur indirect costs via cost pass through from the developer). Or, 
a configuration could exist where several firms undertake a project as a partnership, where all of the 
firms “share” the direct cost of the regulation in some way. Lacking information on the distribution of 
business configurations for projects undertaken by firms in the various C&D sectors and revenue 
ranges, it is inherently difficult to account for these scenarios. As a result, EPA may be 
overestimating or underestimating the baseline fraction of model firms’ activity and revenue that 
could incur direct costs under the regulation (see Section 3.3.3).  
 The Type of Construction Activity Performed by C&D Firms. There is uncertainty with respect to 
the fraction of C&D firm revenue that is generated from potentially in-scope activities (i.e. new 
construction) versus revenue generated from activities that are not potentially in-scope (i.e. additions 
or remodeling work). When the Economic Census assigns C&D firms to NAICS industry sectors, 
they are assigned into the sector from which the majority of their revenue is generated, and therefore, 
not all firm revenue is necessarily associated with activity in their assigned sector. For example, a 
firm assigned to NAICS 236115 generates at least 51% of its revenue from New Single-Family 
Residential Construction, but as much as 49% of the firm’s revenue could come from construction 
activities, such as remodeling, that would not be in-scope. EPA currently accounts for this concept 
using the C&D sector specialization data available from the 2002 Economic Census. There is 
uncertainty in the specialization data because it is only an average representation of the fraction of 
new construction activity undertaken by firm in a given sector. Some firms within a sector perform a 
higher fraction of new construction activity, while some firms likely perform a lower fraction. This 
uncertainty could be partially mitigated by obtaining data from the Census that characterize the 
average/typical “specialization” of firm activities within each NAICS sector and by revenue range 
(see Section 3.3.3). 
 The Number of Projects Typically Completed Annually by C&D Firms. EPA determined whether 
C&D firms, by sector and revenue range, are of sufficient size to perform an in-scope project (using 
the critical revenue value method described in Section 3.3.3) based on the assumption that all of a 
model firm’s revenue would be associated with only one project in a given year. This assumption was 
made because EPA currently lacks information on the distribution of projects, by site size, undertaken 
annually by firms in each revenue range and sector. EPA may therefore be overstating the fraction of 
firms, by sector and revenue range, that are capable of performing in-scope activities to the extent that 
firms typically engage in more than one construction project per year. This assumption effectively 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-57 
minimizes the number of in-scope firms needed to achieve the aggregate estimates of in-scope 
construction acreage and associated compliance cost, and simultaneously maximizes the impact per 
firm. This uncertainty could be mitigated by obtaining data on the distribution of projects, by number 
and value, which firms engage in annually by sector and revenue range. EPA could then assess cases 
in which compliance costs and acreage are spread across a larger number of firms and where the 
impact per firm is reduced relative to the current analysis configuration. 
 The Distribution of Firms within Revenue Ranges. In instances where the critical revenue value lies 
within a revenue range, the fraction of firms estimated to be capable of performing in-scope 
activities – and their associated in-scope project acreage – are calculated using the assumption that 
firms by revenue are distributed uniformly over the revenue range. This assumption is likely to 
overstate the fraction of firms within a given revenue range that can perform in-scope activities 
because for all but the lowest revenue range, firms are not likely to be distributed uniformly within 
the revenue range, but instead their mass is likely to be concentrated at the lower end of the range. 
¾ Determination and Interpretation of Firm Financial Stress and Potential Closure. EPA’s analyses of 
the occurrence of financial stress and potential closures are based on movement of firms below specified 
thresholds of concern – below first quartile values of the financial stress measures and below a zero 
business value for the potential closure measure. Because of data limitations, in particular, these analyses 
involve considerable simplifications both in determining the baseline and post-compliance financial 
performance/condition measures and in assessing the occurrence of the adverse impact conditions. A 
more rigorous financial analysis, based on detailed understandings of the financial status of affected firms 
might yield different impact findings. For example, the analysis of business value is based on a static, 
single time period, model of firm financial performance and condition. A more rigorous analysis would 
consider the change in financial performance and condition over time. For firms with a history and 
expectations of substantial growth, the simplified, static assessment would tend to understate, perhaps 
considerably, business value. Similarly, the use of the first quartile values of Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets 
and Earnings before Interest and Taxes/Interest for use in the financial stress analysis is also subject to 
considerable uncertainty. Although the first quartile values are, by definition, in the lower range of 
observed financial performance for the subject industries, the first quartile values are not necessarily 
strong differentiators between adequate and weak financial performance. EPA sought to ameliorate this 
concern by using the average of first quartile values observed over the full data analysis period (see 
Section 3.3.5.1). 
¾ Determination of Barriers to Entry. There is uncertainty with respect to the model firm’s mechanism for 
absorbing compliance outlays. The comparison of the rule’s financing requirement to the model firm’s 
assets assumes that the compliance outlay would be financed and recorded on the model firm’s balance 
sheet. To the extent that the compliance outlay is financed and recorded not on the firm’s baseline sheet 
but as part of a separate project-based financing for each individual project, this comparison is likely to 
overstate, perhaps substantially, the incremental burden of financing in relation to the going concern asset 
base of the model firms (see Section 3.3.6).  
3.8.3 Analysis of Single-Family Housing Affordability Impacts 
The single-family housing affordability analysis likely overstates the practical impact on home buyers 
prospectively purchasing an in-scope home because purchasers have a number of avenues through which any 
price increase due to the regulation might be mitigated: 
¾ Price negotiation. The home buyer may be able to offset the price increase through negotiation of the 
sales price. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-58 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
¾ Attribute substitution. The home buyer may be able to mitigate the effect of the price increase through 
substitution (e.g., purchasing a new home with marginally different attributes, or effectively the same new 
home in a marginally different location). 
¾ Purchase deferment. The home buyer may be able to mitigate the effect of the regulation by increasing 
the down payment so that the there is no change in what would have otherwise been the monthly 
payment. If the home buyer lacks the financial resources to increase the down payment at the preferred 
time of purchase, the increase in the down payment might be achieved by delaying the purchase and 
saving from current income to reach the needed down payment value. 
¾ Purchase an out-of-scope home. Each of the preceding adjustments involves changes to purchase the 
desired new, in-scope home. However, the prospective home buyer may be able to mitigate the effect of 
the price increase, entirely, by purchasing a new or existing home whose price does not increase as a 
result of the regulation. 
EPA cannot say with certainty whether and to what extent these mechanisms will be effectively employed by 
likely single-family home buyers. But, to the extent that otherwise affected home buyers do mitigate the 
regulation’s impact via these mechanisms, EPA is likely overstating the severity of single-family housing 
affordability effects. 
In addition, other qualification and uncertainties in this analysis are critical for properly understanding the 
practical implications of whether and to what extent households will be affected by the regulation: 
¾ Cost-Pass Through Potential Varies with Prevailing Market Conditions. To provide a worst case 
assessment, the increase in new home price assumes 100 percent pass-through of compliance costs, a 
market condition. This extent of housing price effect is not likely to persist over the long-term due to 
several factors, including (1) the availability of substitutes for any given home, and (2) the determination 
that proposed rule is only expected to affect the equivalent of about 7% of the total number of single-
family home sales.39 And, in periods of housing market weakness, such as currently occurring in U.S. 
housing markets, the assumption of 100 percent compliance cost pass-through may overstate substantially 
the price effect, and therefore critical income value effect, from the regulatory options (see Section 3.4).  
¾ Compliance Cost and Any Related Potential Price Increase are Likely to Decline as with the Baseline 
Sales Price of the Affected Property. An important factor to be accounted for in the analysis for the 
lower-quartile price home is that the compliance cost burden and potential home price increase will 
typically be less for the lower-quartile price home than for the median price home. As a result, simply 
carrying forward the same price effect as used for the median price analysis will overstate the typical 
impact. This occurs because, as indicated by Census data, lot size typically declines with price for new 
single-family homes, thereby reducing the compliance cost burden, which is directly associated with lot 
size, and the resulting price impact per home (see Section 3.4.2). 
¾ Low/Moderate-Income Home Buyers are Less Likely to Purchase Newly Constructed Single-Family 
Homes than Higher Income Home Buyers. The practical impact of the regulation on low/moderate-
income (and first-time home buyers, to the extent these home buyers are more likely of low/moderate 
income) is also probably overstated in the analysis because these households are less likely to purchase 
newly constructed housing than higher income home buyers. As reported in the 2005 American Housing 
Survey (HUD, 2006a), in any given income range, the fraction of home purchases that are new generally 
increases with income (see Figure 5-2). This information indicates that, in general, households with 
higher incomes are more likely to purchase a new home than households with lower income. 
                                                     
39  Based on 2006 home sales data, EPA estimates that approximately 500,000 new, single-family home sales would be expected to incur 
cost under Option 2 out of a total of approximately 6.7 million single-family home sales.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-59 
¾ Market Participation Varies Across Income Ranges. EPA’s analysis recognizes that, at any given time, 
the number of households that are actually in the market for purchasing a home is significantly less than 
the number of households in an MSA. EPA therefore calculated impacts in terms of the numbers of 
prospective home-purchasing households whose purchasing decision is potentially affected by the 
increase in housing price. However, the current analysis identifies these households along the household 
income distribution using a concept whereby the household income distribution is reduced uniformly 
across income ranges based on an average measure of market participation. To the extent that the income 
range containing the critical income value for a given home purchase is found to have a market 
participation rate below the current average participation rate, the affordability impacts are overstated. 
This assumption of a uniform, average market participation rate could be improved with data that 
indicates the number and character of single-family home purchases by income range (see Section 3.4.3). 
¾ Assumption of a Uniform Distribution of Households within Income Ranges. For this analysis, EPA 
assumes that households are uniformly distributed over the income values within an income range. The 
uniform-distribution-of-households-within-range assumption inevitably involves error and could overstate 
or understate the fraction of households within an income range that fall below a critical income value, 
depending on the change in slope of the density distribution over the income range (see Section 3.4.3). 
¾ Price and Character of In-Scope Homes is Unknown. EPA has no basis for determining which homes 
along the home price distribution for any given state will actually incur costs, and therefore a potential 
price effect, under the regulation. The regulatory options specify the number and character of in-scope 
projects, but the kind and price of homes that are most likely to be built within in-scope projects is 
unknown. Therefore, EPA may be overstating affordability effects for either or both of the home price 
affordability analyses. 
3.8.4 Analysis of Social Cost and Economy-Wide Economic Effects 
¾ Elasticities of Supply and Demand Vary Across Regional Markets. EPA estimated the state-level 
partial equilibrium models using national-level estimates of the elasticity of market supply and 
demand. These elasticity values are used to estimate the impact of incremental costs on the supply 
curve and, thus, on prices and quantities of construction products under post-compliance conditions. 
However, the extent to which increased construction costs manifest as higher sales prices and rents – and 
changes in market quantity – depend on supply and demand elasticities in specific construction product 
markets. Elasticities may vary substantially both over time, across regional markets, and within regional 
markets according to supply and demand conditions in specific product segments and other important 
market indicators (e.g., land availability, land-use and other regulatory restrictions, and demographic 
characteristics). To the extent that EPA’s national-level elasticity values vary across the states, EPA may 
be over- or under-estimating the potential market effect on the prices and quantities of C&D market 
output (see Sections 3.5.2.4 and 3.5.2.5).  
¾ Impacts on Markets for Existing Construction Are Not Evaluated. There is uncertainty with respect to 
the effect of existing construction on prices for new construction subject to the regulation, and vice versa. 
 Increased project costs and associated pressure on project prices for new finished product may spill 
over into price effects – as increased sales prices or rents, in the present and in the future – for 
existing finished product not subject to the regulation’s requirements. 
 Conversely, the presence of existing finished product and new product not impacted by the rule 
serves as competition for newly constructed finished product and can thus limit the potential for 
upward pricing pressure on both existing finished product and new finished product subject to the 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
3-60 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
regulation’s requirements. The presence of existing finished product provides a buffer against price 
and rent increases to C&D industry product consumers. 
Given that the new construction expected to be subject to the regulation represents a very small fraction 
of all available construction product (both existing and new), EPA believes that the latter effect is, in 
general, likely to prevail. Therefore, price effects on new residential and non-residential construction 
product may be overstated. In this case, over the longer term, the cost and economic impact of the 
regulation may more likely be borne by owners of undeveloped land as property developers adjust 
construction cost estimates to reflect regulatory requirements and correspondingly adjust the prices to be 
paid for the land on which project development will occur. This effect would be particularly important in 
those instances in which otherwise similar undeveloped properties in the same market have different 
compliance requirements due, for example, to differences in soil and run-off characteristics, or property 
size.  
¾ Assumption of Uniform Impact on the Supply of C&D Output. The partial equilibrium market analysis 
considers the potential for the proposed regulatory options to shift the supply curve upward in each 
market (i.e., via increased production costs), resulting in a higher price per unit and, depending on market 
response, a lower quantity of output. As described in Section 3.5.3, EPA assumes that in-scope C&D 
output is distributed uniformly across the pre-regulation supply curve, resulting in a uniform shift of the 
supply curve. However, EPA has no basis for knowing with certainty exactly which segments of the C&D 
supply curve in any given market will actually be in-scope, and more importantly, where in-scope 
segments sit relative to the pre-regulation market equilibrium. To the extent that the marginal – and hence 
price-determining – supply of C&D output for a given market segment does not incur costs because of the 
regulation, the increase in production cost for other, infra-marginal, segments of the supply schedule may 
have no or little effect on the market price. As a result, EPA may be overstating the change in market 
equilibrium point due to the regulation. This consideration is the same in concept as the last uncertainty 
described in Section 3.8.3. 
3.8.5 Future Projections of Compliance Cost and Acreage 
¾ Future Projections of Industry Activity are Inevitably Uncertain. EPA’s analysis to estimate compliance 
costs and acreage out to the year 2025 inevitably embeds an unknown, and potentially significant, amount 
of uncertainty because it is based on a projection of aggregate C&D industry activity. The actual nature 
and quantity of C&D industry in any year in the future will be determined by overall economic and 
industry conditions, which can vary widely and unpredictably over time. Therefore, it should be 
emphasized that EPA’s estimates of future cost and acreage are highly uncertain and may be over- or 
under-stated, in particular for any given year of the projection. 
¾ Assumption of Constant Acreage Intensity over Time. EPA based the projected estimates of developed 
acreage on an assumption that acreage intensity (e.g., acres developed per million dollars of project value) 
is constant over time. EPA believes, contrary to this assumption, that acreage intensity is more likely to 
decline over time due to several factors, including changes in productivity, the mix and cost of 
construction inputs, the mix of construction activity, and the unavoidable decline in the availability of 
raw, undeveloped land (and hence the tendency to use land more parsimoniously in construction projects 
of a given development value over time). These factors point towards an expectation of declining acreage 
intensity over time. EPA has been able to establish this declining trend for residential construction and is 
in the evaluating these trends for the non-residential C&D sectors. However, EPA currently assumes a 
constant acreage intensity value in the projection analysis. As a result, EPA’s current projections of 
acreage, and therefore cost, may be overstated to the extent that acreage intensity does decline over time. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 3: EA Methodology 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 3-61 
In addition, the compliance cost burden relative to total project value would be expected to decline over 
time as a result of this trend. 
¾ Future Compliance Cost and Acreage may not be Proportional to Total C&D Output and Acreage. 
EPA currently estimates future compliance cost and acreage, based on projections of total C&D output 
and acreage, assuming the compliance costs/acreage change in proportion to total C&D output/acreage. 
This assumption may lead to over- or under-statement of compliance costs and acreage depending on how 
the mix of construction activity in the C&D changes over time in terms of in-scope versus out-of-scope 
activity. For instance, due to the increasing scarcity of new land over time, it is likely that the proportion 
of construction value produced from developing new land will decline over the long term. In addition, it 
is likely that, with the passage of time and increased experience by the C&D industry in complying with 
regulatory requirements, that the industry will become more efficient in deploying economic resources – 
technology, labor, treatment chemicals – to meet the regulation’s performance standards. As a result, the 
estimated unit costs of compliance – i.e., cost per acre – may be expected to decline over time, on an 
inflation-adjusted basis, relative to the estimates underlying this cost and economic impact analysis. This 
factor would further reduce the compliance cost burden of the regulation.

4 Developing the Analysis Baseline 
This chapter estimates key baseline metrics describing the construction industry, model construction firms, and 
developed acreage that underlie the analysis of the regulatory options. The baseline metrics are developed using 
information from the industry profile (Chapter 2) and approaches outlined in the regulatory analysis methodology 
(Chapter 3): 
¾ Section 4.1 summarizes development of the industry baseline for the establishments and firms within the 
C&D industry that are expected to be affected by this regulation and that were accounted for in the firm- 
and industry-level analyses of regulatory options. The section includes a summary of the model financial 
baseline that was developed using the approach for characterizing model firms as described in Chapter 3. 
¾ Sections 4.2 and 4.3 present the estimated quantity of acreage and project development associated with 
the construction industry baseline. This development baseline underlies the analysis of costs and impact 
of compliance with regulatory options for the C&D rule.  
¾ Section 4.4 highlights the primary sources of uncertainty and limitations in the analysis baseline. 
4.1 Construction and Development Industry 
As described in Chapter 2, the Construction and Development industry encompasses business operating in a 
range of construction industry segments. This section outlines those industry segments that are likely to perform 
activities within the scope of the regulation and that are the focus of this regulatory analysis. 
4.1.1 Identifying Industry Segments and Establishments Likely to Be Affected by the C&D 
Regulation 
Table 4-1 shows the 2002 universe of establishments in the entire C&D industry, as reported in the 2002 NAICS 
framework. As described in Chapter 2, 2002 is the most recent year for which SUSB and Economic Census data 
are available. And, as documented in Chapter 2, EPA judges this year to reflect a period in which the individual 
construction industry segments were in neither exceptionally strong nor weak business condition. Accordingly, 
EPA views this year as an appropriate year for building the industrial “snapshot” for this regulatory analysis.  
In the remainder of this section, tables and information are presented at the firm level, which is the focus of the 
industry impact analysis. In addition, the following section summarizes the exclusion of industry segments that 
are not applicable to this regulatory analysis.

The majority of business that fall within the industry definitions outlined in Table 4-1 will not be affected by the 
C&D Regulation. The regulation will apply to only those businesses engaged in activities that disturb land and 
whose individual projects reach a scale that will be subject to regulatory requirements. A substantial number of 
businesses will be exempt from regulatory coverage because they are primarily engaged in subcontracted parts of 
a building project, such as flooring contracts, or they are involved in remodeling activities that will not disturb 
land. In this section, EPA identifies and sets aside from further analysis those industry segments that are not 
likely to perform activities that would be within the scope of the regulation. The estimates for the remaining 
segments are brought together to derive final estimates of the number of establishments expected to be 
covered by a C&D regulation. 
4.1.1.1 Excluding Segments and Establishments That Are Not Involved in Land Disturbance 
The C&D regulation will apply only to those activities that disturb land and that are of sufficient scale to be 
within the regulation’s scope. Therefore, most business within the Special Trade Contractors (NAICS 238) sector 
will not be affected and are excluded from this analysis. The only Special Trade Contractors segment whose 
activities have the potential to result in land disturbance are those entities within NAICS 238910, Site Preparation 
Contractors. The primary groups of entities within this NAICS are Excavation Contractors, Wrecking and 
Demolition Contractors, and All Other Heavy Construction.  
The other sector within the C&D industry that is not likely to perform activities that result in land disturbance is 
NAICS 236118, Residential Remodelers. Based on the Economic Census definitions of the specific sectors within 
NAICS 238 and all of the entities within NAICS 236118, EPA excluded these segments from this analysis.  
4.1.1.2 Excluding Segments and Establishments That Are Not NPDES Permittees 
As stated above, EPA included certain categories within NAICS 238 in the analysis – 1997 NAICS 235930 
(Excavation Contractors), 235940 (Wrecking and Demolition Contractors), and 234990 (All Other Heavy 
Construction), all within 2002 NAICS 238910 – because these establishments engage in land disturbing activities. 
Most often, however, establishments in 2002 NAICS 238910 act as subcontractors on C&D projects and are hired 
by developers or general contractors to perform specific tasks. EPA believes that these establishments will not 
generally appear as NPDES permittees or co-permittees.

4.1.1.3 Adjustments and Exclusions Based on Data Limitations 
EPA expects that businesses in NAICS 237210 (Land Subdivision) will undertake activities that are within the 
scope of the C&D rule. However, data for characterizing the profile of projects performed by NAICS 237210 and 
assigning compliance costs to businesses in this segment are not available and/or are not distinguishable from the 
activities performed by the primary construction sectors – NAICS 236115, 236116, 236210, and 236220 – that are 
expected to be principally affected by the regulation. For this reason, EPA allocated the businesses and economic 
activity reported for NAICS 237210 among these four primary focus sectors. Thus, EPA accounted for the impact 
of the C&D rule on the NAICS 237210 sector in this regulatory analysis, but with those impacts being estimated 
and accounted for in the analysis for the four principal impact sectors: NAICS 236115, 236116, 236210, and 
236220.  
EPA also anticipates that some businesses and activities in the Heavy Construction sector (NAICS 237) will be 
affected by the C&D rule. However, with the exception of NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and bridge 
construction), data are not available to support an assessment of the number and character of projects performed 
by NAICS 237 sector businesses that would be subject to compliance requirements and incur compliance costs. 
For this reason, of the sectors in NAICS 237, only NAICS 237310 (Highway, street, and bridge construction) is 
considered in the cost and impact analysis for the C&D rule. 
4.1.1.4 Total Number of Potentially Affected Establishments 
To summarize, EPA took several steps to adjust the number of affected entities to account for regulatory coverage 
and data availability. A total of 710,431establishments are within the C&D industry, as broadly defined. 
However, as stated in the two previous sections, a large number of businesses are not expected to perform 
activities within the scope of this regulation and were therefore excluded from this regulatory analysis. As a result 
of these exclusions, only about one-fourth of the total C&D industry establishments are expected to be affected by 
the regulation and are covered in this analysis. The specific steps leading to the estimate of potentially affected 
establishments are detailed within Table 4-2.

4.1.2 Determining the Firm Universe Likely To Be Affected by the C&D Regulation 
Since the Economic Census reports data by establishment and not at the level of the firm, EPA used SUSB data to 
develop the firm-level data needed for this analysis: number of firms, employees, and receipts by revenue size. 
Further, because the 2002 SUSB data are reported in the 1997 NAICS framework, EPA used the 2002 Economic 
Census data on the number of establishments, employees, and value of construction by revenue size, to 
reconfigure the 2002 SUSB data within the 2002 NAICS framework, as described below:  
1. The most significant difference between the 2002 and 1997 NAICS frameworks involves the framework 
for reporting data on the residential construction sectors. The 1997 NAICS framework reports residential 
sector data in two sectors – (1) Single-Family Housing Construction and (2) Multifamily Housing 
Construction – while the 2002 NAICS framework reports residential sector data in four sectors: (1) New 
Single-Family Housing Construction, (2) New Multifamily Housing Construction, (3) Residential 
Remodelers, and (4) New Housing Operative Builders. To achieve consistency in its analyses using data 
from both the 1997 and 2002 frameworks, EPA needed to reconfigure the 1997 framework data to align 
with the 2002 framework – by excluding Residential Remodelers from the two 1997 framework sectors 
and by breaking out New Housing Operative Builders as a separate sector. Specifically, EPA used 
Economic Census data to disaggregate the SUSB data among the four 2002 NAICS residential categories. 
EPA based this disaggregation on the Census proportions of establishments, employees, and value within 
the four residential building categories as compared to the totals within residential building construction. 
2. In addition, Economic Census data were used to break down some of the SUSB revenue size ranges into 
size ranges that are more relevant for reflecting differences in baseline financial performance/condition by 
business size and for understanding potential economic/financial impacts by business size. The specific 
revenue ranges used in this analysis are: 
 Less than $1 million 
 $1 - $2.5 million 
 $2.5 - $5 million  
 $5 - $10 million  
 $10 - $50 million  
 $50 - $100 million  
 $100 million and greater

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 4-5 
EPA used Economic Census proportions to break the SUSB $1 - $5 million range into $1 - $2.5 million 
and $2.5 - $5 million revenue ranges. 
3. As noted above, because of data limitations, EPA allocated the firm level information for NAICS 237210 
(Land Subdivision) among the four building sectors according to the each sector’s proportion of 
establishments, employees, and value out of the total. 
Because regulatory coverage and compliance costs are expected to vary over states by regulatory option, it was 
also necessary to break out the firm data by state. Although Economic Census reports establishments, employees, 
and value of construction for each sector by state, SUSB does not report firm-level information by state for 
specific construction sectors. As a result, to develop firm-level data by state, EPA apportioned the national level 
SUSB data over states based on the Economic Census’ proportions by state for each of the relevant firm-level 
data items. EPA further applied sector-specific national revenue range distributions – from Economic Census and 
SUSB, as described above – to the state totals to develop revenue range estimates by state.  
4.1.2.1 Baseline Firm Universe Used in the Regulatory Analysis for the C&D Regulation  
Reflecting the adjustments described above, Table 4-3 presents the baseline universe of firms, revenue, 
employees, and average firm revenue by construction sector and revenue range, which underlies this regulatory 
analysis.40 As described above, the baseline industry “snapshot” data are derived from 2002 Economic Census and 
SUSB data. 
EPA further adjusted the population of affected firms to estimate the number of firms in the C&D industry that 
are small businesses, in accordance with SBA criteria. EPA describes this method in Chapter 2.

4.1.3 Baseline Financial Information for Model Firms 
As described in Chapter 3, EPA based its assessment of industry impacts on an analysis of model firms that were 
defined for the specific construction industry sectors and revenue ranges outlined above. This section summarizes 
key financial information for the model firm baseline.  
To develop the model firms, EPA assigned financial characteristics – balance sheet, income statement, and 
metrics of financial performance and condition – to each of the model firms as defined by the six NAICS sectors 
and seven revenue size ranges, from financial statement information reported by Risk Management Association 
(RMA). Table 4-4 through Table 4-6 present key baseline financial information – Pre-Tax Income/Total Assets, 
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Interest, and Net Income Margin – for model firms in each of the 
construction sectors and revenue ranges. The values presented are based on the General Business Conditions case 
relationships (i.e., an averaged dataset over the 5-year period April 2002 through March 2007). As described in 
Chapter 3, the values necessarily show improvement in baseline financial performance over the three quartile 
values – First Quartile (weakest performance), Median, and Third Quartile (strongest performance). In addition, 
these data generally show strengthening financial performance as business size increases within each NAICS 
sector. This observation underscores the importance of accounting for variation in baseline financial condition and 
performance by business size in the cost and economic impact analysis for this regulation.

In the impact analysis, cost and impacts are assessed at the level of the model firms based on the estimated 
compliance activity that the model firms undertake and the resulting compliance costs assigned to the firms. 
These model firm-based findings are then extrapolated to the construction industry, based on the numbers of firms 
within each combination of NAICS sector and revenue range as summarized in Table 4-3: Baseline Firm Level 
Data by Revenue Range and NAICS Sector, above (see Chapter 3). 
4.2 Construction Activity and Acreage Developed by Industry and Model Firms 
In any year, the cost of the C&D rule to the construction industry and society will depend on the quantity of 
acreage on which in-scope construction activity is performed. Accordingly, the baseline estimate of construction 
activity and acreage is a key element of the baselines for this regulatory analysis.  
EPA used two methods to estimate total acreage that could fall within the scope of the C&D rule:  
1. A “top-down” estimate of acreage developed annually, nationally and by state, from the Multi-Resolution 
Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium’s National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD)41  
2. A “bottom-up” estimate (that estimates for each model firm) the quantity of acreage and construction 
activity that can be performed based on the revenue size category. This is important for determining if the 
firms’ annual revenue is sufficiently high enough to reflect a scale of activity – i.e., by acreage – that 
would be within the regulation’s scope. The individual model firm estimates were aggregated to the 
industry level, based on the number of firms by NAICS sector and revenue range, as reported in Table 
4-3.  
                                                     
41  Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium is a group of federal agencies who use Landsat 5 imagery for the 
conterminous United States to develop a land cover dataset called the National Land Cover Dataset.

In order to incorporate the projected in-scope acres and compliance for each option into the impact analysis, the 
“bottom-up,” model firm-based estimates were reconciled to the “top-down,” NLCD-based development 
estimates by modestly adjusting the parameter values used to estimate the acreage and construction activity that 
could be performed by the model firms.  
4.2.1 “Top-down”-Based Acreage Estimate 
The Top-Down estimate of developed acreage is derived from comparing NLCD data for 1992 and 2001. The 
NLCD data indicate that, on average, approximately 590,000 acres of land were newly developed each year 
during this period (U.S. EPA, 2008). EPA interprets these data as representing the annual average quantity of 
acreage developed for that time period on sites of at least one acre and therefore potentially within the scope of 
the regulatory options that were considered in developing the C&D proposed rule. EPA is using this estimate to 
represent the expected level of development for the purpose of the economic analysis. 
EPA used Notice of Intent (NOI) data for permits under the Stormwater Regulation to disaggregate the NLCD 
acreage among sectors and states. EPA spread the 590,000 total acres among three construction activity 
categories: (1) residential building, approximately 287,000 acres; (2) non-residential building, 248,000 acres, and 
(3) transportation, 55,000 acres. The NOI data were also used to estimate acreage, for the residential and non-
residential building sectors, in two size categories that were important in defining and estimating the impact of 
regulatory options: (1) small projects – 1 to 10 acres; and (2) large projects – 10 or more acres. Additionally, state 
level breakouts were provided according to the NOI data. The acreage breakouts by general sector, project size, 
and state are provided in Table 4-7, below.

To use the NLCD acreage estimates in the firm-level analysis required further disaggregating these values into the 
specific NAICS sectors for which the regulatory analysis was performed. EPA based this sector-level 
disaggregation on information from the 2006 Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing and from Reed 
Construction Data.  
Reed Construction Data (Reed) is a commercial construction industry data service that collects and reports 
information on multifamily, commercial/institutional, and industrial construction projects undertaken nationally. 
Project data reported by Reed that are relevant to this analysis, include site size, constructed square footage, and 
project value. This economic analysis used data from Reed for over 30,000 projects over the period 2001 through 
February 2008, which is the data period used in the analysis.  
EPA used the Reed data to develop a distribution of acreage by the small and large project classifications, and by 
the relevant categories of construction activity: commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential. Reed does not 
report a large enough set of single-family projects to support development of reliable size distributions or to 
determine the percent of single-family acreage that would fall within site size ranges for the single-family 
residential project category. However, Reed does report information for approximately 6,000 multifamily projects 
and EPA used site size information for these projects to determine the percent of acreage that falls within the 
small and large multifamily construction category. For the multifamily residential sector, EPA determined that 
approximately 86 percent of acreage is within projects greater than or equal to ten acres. The remaining 14 
percent of acreage is within projects less than ten acres. The non-residential information was used to distribute 
non-residential acreage between the commercial and industrial categories, and accordingly to the NAICS sectors 
that specifically engage in commercial and industrial construction activity.42 Table 4-8, following page, presents 
the acreage distribution by project size category for the non-residential sector. The non-residential percentages 
represent the percent of acreage within each non-residential construction sector for each size category.  
                                                     
42  In working with the Reed data, EPA used a subset of project records that were “cleaned” to remove outlier observations that appear to 
contain erroneous data (e.g., site size data that appeared to be reported in square feet instead of acres) and that might otherwise have 
skewed the findings from the Reed data. The “cleaning” concept is based on analysis of the indicated “acreage intensity” – acreage per 
reported dollar value of activity – from the Reed data observations. The observation subset included those records that fell within the 
5th and 95th percentiles of calculated acreage intensity values.

EPA examined additional data sources to determine the breakout between single-family and multifamily acreage 
within the residential category. In combination with the Reed data for multifamily projects, data on the 
characteristics of multi-family and single-family units from the 2006 Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New 
Housing support a break-out of total acreage by each of the four residential classifications.  
Census reports the annual number of multifamily units completed by unit size ranges. The Reed data provide both 
the number of units and site size, which supports calculating the average site size per building by the unit size 
ranges provided within Census data. Multiplying the number of buildings by the average site size per building 
within each unit size range yields the total number of acres within each unit size range. EPA summed the totals by 
unit size range to arrive at the total number of acres for multi-family buildings. Census also reports the number of 
attached single-family units (townhomes) by site size. Since EPA classified townhomes within the multifamily 
residential category, EPA included the total acreage for attached single-family units in the multifamily category. 
EPA then determined the average site size within each site size range. Multiplying the average site size by the 
number of units by site size range yielded the total number of acres within each site size range. EPA summed the 
totals by site size range to arrive at the total number of acres for attached single-family units. The total number of 
acres completed for multifamily buildings and attached single-family units were summed to arrive at the total 
acreage completed for the multifamily residential category. 
In addition, Census reports the number of detached single-family units by site size range. The average site size 
within each site size range multiplied by the number of units in the site size range yields an estimate of the total 
number of acres by site size range. EPA summed these totals by site size range to arrive at the total number of 
acres for detached single-family units. The percent of single-family and multi-family acreage out of the total 
residential acreage was then estimated from the total number of acres for the single-family and multifamily 
residential categories. These percentages, as shown within Table 4-9, were applied to the top-down estimate of 
total residential acreage to arrive at the total of single-family and multi-family acreage.

The percentage of acres within the small and large multifamily classification, as shown within Table 4-8, 
determines the total number of small and large multifamily acres. The residual number of acres is expected to 
apply to the small and large single-family classification.  
These estimated allocations of acreage by construction activity yield the following breakdown of the “top-down” 
acreage by the NAICS sectors under analysis (see Table 4-10, following page).

4.2.2 “Bottom-up”-Based Acreage Estimate 
The “top-down” approach provided an estimate of acreage developed based in the MRLC’s NLCD, while the 
“bottom-up” approach is based on industry level data – i.e., assigning acreage to the model firms. To develop the 
“bottom-up” estimates, EPA used industry level data, as presented in Table 4-3, with acreage data from 2006 
Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing and Reed Construction. In developing the “bottom-up” 
estimate, EPA in effect estimated the quantity of acreage and construction activity that a model firm could engage 
in – either as a started or completed construction project – annually, given the revenue size of the model firm and 
the historical relationship of project acreage and value – acreage intensity – for projects in the various broad 
categories of construction activity. After developing bottom-up estimates of acreage and construction activity for 
the model firms, by construction activity category, and for the total industry, EPA examined these values in 
relation to the top-down estimates and decided to reconcile the bottom-up estimates to the top-down estimates for 
the development of the model firm and industry baseline, and for assignment of compliance costs to model firms 
in the cost and economic impact analysis. 
To assign acreage to the model firms, EPA relied on data from the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New 
Housing, for single-family housing, and from Reed Construction, for the multifamily and nonresidential building 
construction sectors, to derive a relationship between project acreage and value. This concept, acreage intensity, 
is defined as the number of acres developed per dollar value of activity accruing as revenue to the firm. The 
acreage intensity concept asks the question: how much acreage of construction activity is required to generate a 
given project value? EPA used data from the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing to develop an 
acreage intensity distribution for the single-family building construction sector. Reed Construction data provided 
acreage intensity distributions for the multifamily and nonresidential building construction sectors. In developing 
these acreage intensity distributions, EPA expressed all dollar values from different years in a single common data 
year, 2002, based on the Construction Cost Index. An acreage intensity distribution was not available for the 
transportation sector. Therefore, a single, average value was used for this sector (derived from the Federal 
Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Highway Statistics). 
In using the project site size data from the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing and the project size 
data within Reed Construction, EPA recognized that these data sources do not account for road development 
associated with a building’s construction. As a result, the reported acreage values and acreage intensity calculated 
from these datasets would understate affected project acreage and acreage intensity. To address this omission, 
EPA applied a multiplier to scale-up all of acreage and resulting acreage intensity values to account for the typical 
road development “overhead” associated with new construction activity. These multipliers (see Table 4-11), were 
derived from information in the Center for Watershed Protection’s Impervious Cover and Land Use in the 
Chesapeake Bay Watershed (Capiella, 2001). This document provides data, by sector, on the acreage allocations 
among the different elements of a lot, e.g., buildings, roads, sidewalks, open space, etc. EPA determined the 
percent allocation for roads within a lot area and applied these multipliers to the acreage intensity values. Table 
4-12, following page, presents the derived acreage intensity values for all the NAICS sectors (with distribution 
values for all sectors except transportation).

At the level of the model firm, acreage intensity determines the total amount of acreage that a firm can develop 
annually: that is, multiplying a model firm’s revenue value by acreage intensity (acreage per dollar of project 
value) indicates the total amount of construction activity acreage for which the model firm can begin (or 
complete) projects in a given year. To develop the initial estimates of baseline acreage by model firm and for the 
industry in aggregate, EPA multiplied the median acreage intensity values reported above in conjunction by the 
average revenue value for the model firms by revenue range in each NAICS sector.43 Summing the indicated 
acreage values across the number of firms by revenue range within a sector yields the total amount of acreage by 
general sector (i.e., residential, non-residential, transportation). As described here, this calculation provides an 
estimate of total acreage and construction activity by model firm, but does not account for the configuration of 
that activity in terms of number of projects and size of individual projects. Thus, by itself, this calculation does 
not indicate whether a given model firm would complete contiguous projects that would be within the scope of a 
regulatory option (depending on the acreage coverage threshold of the option, e.g., projects of at least one acre, 
projects of at least 10 acres, etc.). Therefore, to estimate the compliance acreage that could be undertaken by a 
given model firm and, as a result, the compliance costs that the model firm would incur (as described in Chapter 
3), it was necessary to make an assumption about the configuration of the acreage on which projects could be 
performed by a given model firm. In this calculation, EPA assumed that all of the construction activity started (or 
completed) in a year was for a single project and so occurred on one contiguous site.  
As might be expected, the acreage estimates in aggregate and by broad construction category, as derived from this 
bottom-up method, differ from the top-down estimates reported in Table 4-10 of the preceding section. For four of 
the building categories (all except Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) – i.e., New Single-Family 
Housing Construction (except Operative Builders), New Multifamily Housing Construction (except Operative 
Builders), New Housing Operative Builders, and Industrial Building Construction – the bottom-up estimate of 
acreage based on the median acreage intensity value was less than the estimated top-down values. As described 
above, EPA used the median acreage intensity value as the starting point for the acreage calculations described in 
this section. In using the median percentile acreage intensity values as the starting point for this analysis, EPA did 
not expect the bottom-up acreage calculation to match the top-down value, if for no other reason than the mean, 
and not the median, of the acreage intensity distribution would be the appropriate measure for estimating total 
acreage development. Implicitly, the calibration to reconcile the bottom-up estimates to the top-down estimates is 
                                                     
43  For each construction sector, the acreage intensity distribution is right skewed, i.e. the mean is greater than the median. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 4: Baseline 
4-14 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
finding the mean of the acreage intensity distribution. That the mean is greater than median for four of the 
distributions is consistent with the “right” or positive skewness of these distributions: that is, the distributions are 
bounded on the low-side by a value greater than zero but are open-ended on the up-side and with a relatively long 
“right tail” of higher acreage intensity values. The presence of the longer right tail of high acreage intensity values 
on these distributions “pulls” the mean above the median. 
Apart from the difference in the top-down and bottom-up calculations due to use of the median acreage intensity 
value, instead of the mean, as the starting point for calculating the bottom-up acreage estimates, there are 
numerous potential sources of discrepancy that could be attributed to aspects of both the top-down and bottom-up 
approaches. EPA considers one source of this discrepancy to be the project values used in the calculation of 
acreage intensity.  
As a final step in developing the acreage and construction activity baseline, EPA adjusted the acreage intensity 
values used in the acreage calculation to reconcile the bottom-up estimates to the top-down estimates, by sector – 
i.e., a higher acreage intensity value increases the acreage developed per dollar of revenue, thus increasing the 
overall acreage developed for these categories. For the Commercial and Institutional Building Construction 
category, the bottom-up estimate exceeded the top-down estimate. Accordingly, for this category, EPA reduced 
the acreage intensity to reconcile the bottom-up estimate to the top-down estimate – i.e., a lower acreage intensity 
value decreases the acreage developed per dollar of revenue, thus decreasing the overall acreage developed for 
the non-residential categories. A similar adjustment was required for the transportation sector, where estimated 
bottom-up acreage also exceeded the top-down estimate. Table 4-13 reports the initial and adjusted acreage 
intensity values and percentiles that were required to reconcile the bottom-up estimates to the top-down estimates, 
by construction sector and regulatory option. 
As shown in Table 4-13, the initial acreage intensity values and the adjusted values – which reconcile acreage to 
the top-down derived values for the regulatory options – differ by varying degrees. The values for the non-
residential sectors (Industrial Building Construction and Commercial and Institutional Building) are quite close to 
the median, with the Industrial Building Construction sector value being slightly above the median for all options 
and the Commercial and Institutional Building value being slightly above the median for Options 1 and 3. The 
values for the residential sectors lie consistently above and somewhat farther from the median, perhaps suggesting 
that the positive skewness phenomenon described above is of greater importance for the residential sector 
distributions. Regardless, given that the top-down and bottom-up estimates derive from completely independent 
estimation methods, the finding that these independently derived estimates are approximately close provides a 
degree of assurance about the reasonableness of the methods for estimating the total acreage and construction 
activity values, and the allocation of these values over construction activity categories and industry segments.

single-family units and of multifamily, non-residential, and transportation projects that are indicated by the 
acreage aggregates, based on the distribution of single-family housing units by lot size or project size (see Table 
4-15, below). For each construction activity category, dividing total acreage by the relevant unit or project size 
yields the number of construction activity units or projects.

For the estimate of single-family units, EPA used the distribution of single-family units among lot size ranges, as 
reported by the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing. As compared to the average lot size, the 
distribution of single-family units among the lot size ranges provides a more precise estimation as to the number 
of construction activity units. Within the industry sector and model firm framework, single-family units may be 
constructed by firms in both NAICS 236115 and 236117. The number of units in NAICS 236115 is determined by 
1) apportioning the total acreage for that NAICS sector among the different lot size ranges (according to the 
distribution of units among the lot size ranges) and then 2) dividing the relevant acreage apportioned to each lot 
size range by the average lot size within the range. However, because firms in NAICS 236117 may perform 
activities in both the single-family construction and multifamily construction category, EPA first disaggregated 
the total NAICS 236117 acreage between the two construction activity categories using the acreage distribution 
percentages reported in Table 4-9. Subsequently, EPA performed the same disaggregation of acreage falling in the 
single-family construction category among the different lot size ranges and then divided the number of acres by 
the average single-family lot size within the relevant range to derive the number of single-family housing units for 
NAICS 236117. The remaining acreage is divided by the average project size for multifamily housing 
construction to derive the number of multifamily housing projects for NAICS 236117.

FHWA. Therefore, EPA used the average project size previously determined from the NOI data to calculate the 
implied number of transportation projects.  
Table 4-16, below, reports the indicated number of unit or project starts, by year, for each of the construction 
activity categories and related business sectors.

a No information is available on the number of individual housing units within a single-family project. Therefore, the units count for NAICS 236115 and 
NAICS 236117 is for the number of units, not projects.  
b The number of single-family units and multifamily projects is determined for NAICS 236117 based on the residential acreage breakout reported in Table 
4-9.  
 
As a test of validity, EPA then compared the estimated the number of single-family units to single-family unit 
data present in the Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New Housing. Table 4-17 reports the average number of 
single-family housing units started during the 1990’s reported within the Census data. EPA’s estimated number of 
units reported within Table 4-16 – approximately 950,000, which is reasonably comparable to the Census’s 
reported average of approximately 1.1 million units. This simple data comparison is used as an example to help 
demonstrate and verify the overall reasonableness of EPA’s approach for estimating total developed acreage.

Comparable data are not available for multi-family, non-residential, and non-building projects, and therefore, this 
simple validity test is only performed for the single-family sector. 
4.4 Key Sources of Uncertainty and Limitations 
The primary sources of uncertainty and limitations in the analysis baseline are highlighted below: 
¾ Compilation of the C&D Firm Universe Potentially Subject to Regulation. As described in Section 
4.1.2, to develop the firm-level analysis baseline, EPA blended together firm-level data from the 
Economic Census and SUSB to reconcile inconsistencies between data reported at the level of the 
establishment versus the level of C&D firms. In addition, EPA reconfigured these data to develop firm-
level data by state. This process, although appropriate and credible for the stated purpose, inevitably 
introduces error into the baseline economic data. EPA has no basis for knowing the quantity or direction 
of error in these data.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 4: Baseline 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 4-17 
¾ Model Firm Revenue Values and Number of Firms by Industry Segment and Revenue Range are 
based on 2002 Data. EPA used C&D industry activity – in terms of numbers of firms, revenues, 
employees – for the year 2002 as the base year for the economic analysis. This year was chosen because it 
is the most recent year for which SUSB and Economic Census data are available for the C&D sectors. 
Although the current and future average values of revenue for firms in the various revenue range 
categories will most likely differ from the values observed in 2002, there is no obvious basis – e.g., an 
index of business revenue change – on which to adjust the average revenue values.  
¾ Baseline Financial Data for Model Firms. To develop the model firms, EPA assigned financial 
characteristics – balance sheet, income statement, and metrics of financial performance and condition – to 
each of the model firms as defined by the six NAICS sectors and seven revenue size ranges, from 
financial statement information reported by Risk Management Association (RMA) (see Section 4.1.3). 
RMA compiles and reports financial statement information by industry as provided by member 
commercial lending institutions. Because the financial statements received by RMA are for businesses 
applying for credit from member institutions, these data do not constitute a statistically valid random 
sample. Nevertheless, EPA, which has utilized the same data in previous economic analyses, believes 
these data are of high quality and do offer the advantage of being available at the 6-digit NAICS level and 
for quartile ranges of baseline financial performance and condition. 
¾ Acreage Intensity Source Data. There is uncertainty with respect to the Reed Construction data that 
underlies the estimated acreage intensity distributions for the multifamily and nonresidential building 
construction sectors. Recall that acreage intensity is defined as the number of acres developed per dollar 
value of activity accruing as revenue to the firm. Acreage intensity is an important data input to the 
economic analysis used for multiple purposes, including: to establish the baseline estimate of construction 
acreage across sectors and revenue range, and to establish the quantity of acreage developed by a model 
firm that could be within the scope of the regulation. The source of potential error derives from the Reed 
“value of construction” data, which is used as the denominator in estimating acreage intensity. The value 
field is intended to capture the value of the construction activity itself, and may not capture other 
components of eventual total project revenue, e.g., land value, financing costs, or developer’s markups. 
As such, the Reed-reported value may understate the overall project value, and thus revenue that could 
accrue from these activities (thus overstating the quantity of acreage developed – and therefore 
compliance cost incurred – per dollar of total project value). Furthermore, because this information is 
self-reported by builders/developers and not subsequently verified at the end of a project, there is 
fundamentally an unknown amount of error in the value estimates (see Section 4.2.2).

5 Economic Impact Analysis Results 
As described in Chapter 3, EPA undertook a number of analyses to gauge the cost and economic impact of the 
three regulatory options considered for the C&D industry regulation. These analyses include: 
1. An assessment of the potential cost and economic/financial impact of alternative regulatory options on the 
industries and firms likely to face compliance requirements and incur compliance costs from a C&D 
industry regulation. This analysis yields estimates of the numbers of firms in the affected C&D industry 
sectors that may incur adverse economic/financial effects: costs exceeding thresholds of concern relative 
to revenue, incurrence of financial stress from weakened financial performance and condition, and 
potential incurrence of negative business value, which may indicate a risk of business closure. This 
analysis also produces a first-order estimate (i.e., before accounting for potential market adjustment 
effects) of the resource cost of regulatory compliance (i.e., the cost of resources consumed by society in 
meeting regulatory requirements) and of the acreage affected by the regulatory options. Finally, this 
analysis supports an assessment of the potential for C&D regulatory options to pose a barrier to entry for 
new businesses seeking to enter the C&D industry 
2. An assessment of the potential single-family housing affordability effects of alternative regulatory 
options. This analysis estimates, by Metropolitan Statistical Area, the potential change in price for newly 
constructed single-family homes, and the associated number of prospective home buyers whose 
purchasing decisions may be affected by the potential increase in new home prices due to compliance 
requirements.  
3. An assessment of the total social cost of alternative regulatory options, reflecting the potential for change 
in the total output of the affected C&D industries as a result of cost-induced price increases in 
construction product markets. The reduction in construction industry activity and output reduces the 
resource cost of compliance estimated in the firm and industry impact analysis (the so-called “first-order” 
estimate). However, the reduction in construction industry activity and output also reduces the net 
economic welfare to society from production and consumption of C&D industry output. The estimates of 
impact on industry output are based on an analysis of market response to the regulatory options 
undertaken on a state-by-state basis. The social cost estimate reported from this analysis accounts for both 
the output reduction and the loss in net economic welfare from production and consumption of C&D 
industry output. The social cost estimate also accounts for expected Federal, State, and local government 
administrative costs for reviewing and processing discharge monitoring reports (DMRs), which are 
required for each in-scope project under Option 2 and Option 3, the most stringent option. 
4. An assessment of the economy-wide effects of alternative regulatory options, including the output and 
employment effects resulting from the consumption of society’s resources to achieve compliance with 
regulatory options, the output and employment effects resulting from reduced activity in the C&D 
industries, and the output and employment effects resulting from administrative activities performed by 
Federal, State, and local governments.  
5. An assessment of future cost and acreage effects of alternative regulatory options. As explained in earlier 
chapters, EPA’s analyses of the alternative regulatory options are based on a construction industry and 
construction activity baseline for 2002, which is the most recent year for which detailed economic 
information on the construction industry is available from the Economic Census and Small Business 
Administration, the two principal sources of baseline information for this analysis. Because the regulation 
will be implemented at a later time than this baseline analysis year, EPA projected forward the cost and 
acreage effects accounting for the expected levels of construction industry activity during the years in 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 5: EA Results 
5-2 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
which the regulation will begin to be implemented, and also accounting for the phase-in of the regulation 
as states renew their Construction General Permits, which will adopt and apply the provisions of this 
regulation to construction and development activities in their states. This projection relies on a recent 
forecast of total construction industry activity over the next several years.  
The remainder of this chapter first reviews the regulatory options considered in this analysis and then summarizes 
the findings from the impact analyses outlined above. The chapter includes four appendixes:  
1. Appendix 5-1: Primary Analysis Case – Detailed Firm and Industry Analysis Results by Industry Sector 
and Revenue Range 
2. Appendix 5-2: Adverse Analysis Case – Summary of Firm and Industry Analysis Results

4. Appendix 5-4: State-Level Compliance Cost and Acreage 
5.1 Overview of Proposed Regulatory Options 
This economic analysis evaluates the economic impacts of three regulatory options: 
¾ Option 1 would establish minimum sizing criteria for sediment basins used at construction sites with 10 
or more disturbed acres draining to one location. Under this option, permittees would be required to 
install sediment basins that provide either 3,600 cubic feet per acre of runoff storage, or be designed to 
store runoff from the local 2-year, 24-hour storm event, whichever is less expensive. This option also 
includes requirement for implementing a variety of erosion and sediment controls on all construction sites 
that are required to obtain a permit (e.g., larger than one acre). 
¾ Option 2 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, and in addition, requires construction sites of 
30 or more acres to meet a numeric turbidity limit in stormwater discharges from the site. The numeric 
turbidity standard would be applicable to stormwater discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-
year, 24-hour event. The turbidity standard would only apply to construction sites located in areas where 
the rainfall runoff erosivity factor (R-factor) as defined in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 
(RUSLE) is greater than or equal to 50 and if the soils on the site contain 10% or more by mass of soil 
particles smaller than 2 microns in diameter. 
¾ Option 3 incorporates the same requirements as Option 1, and in addition, requires all sites with 10 or 
more acres of disturbed land to meet a numeric turbidity standard. Unlike Option 2, the turbidity standard 
would apply to all sites, regardless of soil types or R-factor. The turbidity standard would apply to all 
stormwater discharges for all storm events up to the local 2-year, 24-hour event. 
EPA is proposing Option 2 for this rulemaking.  
5.2 Key Findings 
In this section, EPA reports the results from the five cost and impact analyses described in Chapter 3 and 
summarized at the beginning of this chapter. Table 5-1 summarizes the key cost and sediment removal figures for 
each option as provided by the engineering analysis.

5.2.1 Firm- and Industry-Level Cost and Impacts & Barriers to Entry Analysis 
5.2.1.1 Firm- and Industry-Level Cost and Impacts 
Table 5-2, below, presents EPA’s estimates of the cost and firm- and industry-level impact of the regulatory 
options. These results are based on the 2002 snapshot of industry and activity and are before possible reductions 
in the quantity of construction activity resulting from market adjustment to compliance cost-induced price 
increases. As described in Chapter 3, EPA performed these analyses for two impact assessment cases: the primary 
impact analysis case and the adverse impact analysis case. The results presented below are for the primary 
analysis case. EPA presents that the primary case impact analysis as its best estimate of firm- and industry-level 
impacts under general, long-term business conditions for the construction industry. The results for the adverse 
analysis case are presented in Appendix 6.2. Recall from Chapter 3 that the primary and adverse analysis cases 
are differentiated in the following ways: 
¾ The primary analysis case assumes that firms in the C&D industry pass through some of the incremental 
compliance costs and uses the general business conditions case definition for model C&D firms. The 
general business conditions case is meant to reflect the financial performance and condition of C&D 
industry businesses during normal – neither excessively strong nor weak – economic conditions for the 
specific industrial segments. The financial performance and condition of the C&D industry businesses for 
this case is reflected in the RMA model-firm financial statements and their costs of debt and equity. 
¾ The adverse analysis case assumes that firms in the C&D industry pass through none of the incremental 
compliance costs and uses the adverse business conditions case definition for model C&D firms. The 
adverse business conditions case is meant to reflect the financial performance and condition of C&D 
industry businesses during relatively weak economic conditions for the specific industrial segments. The 
financial performance and condition of the C&D industry businesses for this case is reflected in the 
relatively weaker RMA model-firm financial statements and by their relatively higher costs of debt and 
equity. In addition, the adverse analysis case assumes a slight contraction of the overall C&D industry 
relative to the primary analysis case. Additional detail on the adverse analysis case is provided with the 
results in Appendix 6.2. 
The results presented in Table 5-2 are aggregated across the affected industry sectors and revenue ranges used in 
the analysis. Disaggregated results, by industry sector and by revenue range for the primary analysis case, are 
presented in Appendix 6-1.

EPA Estimates         
 
The estimated levels of cost, affected acreage, and resulting firm and industry impacts reported in Table 5-2 vary 
substantially over the three primary regulatory options analyzed.  
¾ For Option 1, the least costly of the three options, EPA estimates total costs of $132 million ($2008) 
occurring on a total of 119,000 affected acres. A total of 3,200 firms are estimated to incur compliance 
costs under this option. Out of these 3,200 firms, none are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 or 3 
percent of revenue, while 17 firms are estimated to incur financial stress. These 17 firms represent 0.5 
percent of all firms incurring cost and essentially zero percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. 
A total of 18 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of regulatory 
requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to experience 
negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be additive.  
¾ For Option 2, EPA estimates total costs of $1,890 million ($2008) occurring on a total of 290,000 
affected acres. Thus, cost and affected acreage under Option 2 are approximately 14.3 and 2.4 times the 
corresponding values under Option 1. A total of 6,400 firms are estimated to incur compliance costs under 
this option. Out of these 6,400 firms, 774 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue, and 
33 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. The 774 firms incurring cost exceeding 1 
percent of revenue represent 12 percent of the firms that are estimated to incur costs, but less than 1 
percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. When the effect of cost pass-through is accounted for 
in the cost-to-revenue analysis – i.e., costs are reduced by the amount of estimated offsetting revenue 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 5: EA Results 
November 14, 2008  Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 5-5 
increase – 15 firms are estimated to incur (net) costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue. A total of 147 firms 
are estimated to incur financial stress as a result of regulatory requirements. These 147 firms represent 2.3 
percent of all firms incurring cost but less than 0.1 percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. A 
total of 103 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of regulatory 
requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to experience 
negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be additive. 
¾ For Option 3, the most costly option, EPA estimates total costs of $3,797 million ($2008) occurring on a 
total of 524,000 affected acres. Thus cost and affected acreage under Option 3 are approximately of 2.0 
and 1.8 times the corresponding values under Option 2. A total of 13,800 firms are estimated to incur 
compliance costs under this option. Out of these 13,800 firms, 2,475 are estimated to incur costs 
exceeding 1 percent of revenue, and 146 are estimated to incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. The 
2,475 firms with cost greater than 1 percent of revenue represent 18 percent of firms estimated to incur 
costs and 2.4 percent of all firms in the affected industry sectors. The 220 firms incurring cost greater than 
3 percent of revenue represent 1.6 percent of firms estimated to incur costs. When the effect of cost pass-
through is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue analysis – i.e., costs are reduced by the amount of 
estimated offsetting revenue increase – 39 firms are estimated to incur (net) costs exceeding 1 percent of 
revenue. A total of 445 firms are estimated to incur financial stress as a result of regulatory requirements. 
These 445 firms represent 3.2 percent of all firms incurring cost but 0.3 percent of all firms in the affected 
industry sectors. A total of 389 firms are estimated to experience negative business value as a result of 
regulatory requirements. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be estimated to 
experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact may not be 
additive. 
5.2.1.2 Barriers to Entry Analysis 
Overall, the C&D industry is a dynamic industry, with a relatively high rate of entry and exit as compared to the 
national economy. At the outset, this observation suggests relatively low barriers to entry for the industry and may 
suggest that an increase in factors associated with high barriers to entry would need to be substantial before a 
material barriers-to-entry effect would be observed. Table 5-3 reports the total number of firm or establishment 
entries and exits for the construction industry and for the total U.S. economy for the seven-year period 1998 to 
2004.44 EPA compared these numbers to the total base of firms or establishments to determine the percentage of 
entries and exits for each year, and calculated the average of these values over the seven data years. As reported in 
Table 5-3, the percentage of entries and exits for the C&D industry is higher than the comparable values for all 
U.S. industries.

As described in Chapter 3: Economic Impact Analysis Methodology, EPA assessed the potential for the C&D 
regulatory options to pose an entry barrier for new businesses by examining the extent to which the regulation 
                                                     
44  U.S. SBA reports the U.S. total figures by the number of firms and reports the Construction sector figures by the number of 
establishments. Since the relevant comparison is based on the percent of entries/exits as compared to the total base, the difference in 
reporting does not inhibit the comparison. 2004 is the latest year for which data are available from SBA.

would increase the capital required by firms of various revenue sizes to participate in the industry. A substantial 
increase in capital requirements could mean that some firms might not be able to assemble the capital necessary to 
participate in the industry. 
Table 5-4 summarizes the results from this analysis for the three regulatory options by business sector and 
revenue range. As shown in Table 5-4, under all options, nearly all model firms in the three lowest revenue ranges 
are expected to incur no compliance outlay and hence would experience no change in financing requirements for 
entering the C&D industry. Thus, the regulatory options are expected to create no more than a minimal additional 
barrier to entry for firms in these revenue ranges, which across the board, are comprised of small businesses.  
Within the higher revenue ranges (generally Revenue Range 4 and up) in which firms are estimated to perform 
projects that will be subject to compliance requirements, the additional financing requirement varies by regulatory 
option. For Option 2 (Table 5-4), the increase in financing requirement varies from approximately 0.6 percent to 
5.6 percent of baseline assets over the business sectors. This comparison assumes that the compliance outlay 
would be financed and recorded on the model firm’s balance sheet. To the extent that the compliance outlay is 
financed and recorded not on the firm’s baseline sheet but as part of a separate project-based financing for each 
individual project, this comparison is likely to overstate, perhaps substantially, the incremental burden of 
financing in relation to the going concern asset base of the model firms.  
The variation by business sector reflects differences in baseline assets in relation to revenue as reported in the 
Risk Management Association financial statements underlying the model firms. For example, in no instance for 
Option 2 is the estimated increase in financing requirements substantial in relation to baseline assets.  
It is important to note that EPA does not consider the estimated financing requirement and the relative burden of 
that requirement – additional financing requirement relative to baseline assets – to vary between existing C&D 
industry businesses and businesses seeking to enter the industry. As a result, EPA foresees no differential 
regulatory burden that would more adversely affect entering businesses than existing business and thus lead to a 
comparative barrier to entry for firms seeking to enter the industry. 
Finally, the expectation of an increase in financing requirements occurs primarily among the larger revenue 
ranges in the analysis. Given their business size, the firms in these revenue ranges would be expected to have 
better access to financing – both for debt and equity capital – than firms in the lower revenue ranges. Thus, the 
burden of any additional financing is comparatively less than would have been the case if the regulation was 
expected to impose compliance requirements on smaller businesses, which, in general, have less favorable access 
to capital.  
The less costly Option 1 would impose a comparatively lower increase in financing requirements while the more 
costly Option 3 would impose a comparatively high increase in financing requirements.

5.2.2 Single-Family Housing Affordability Analysis 
Because the C&D rule may increase the cost of housing construction and, as a result, the price (or rent) of 
housing, the regulation has the potential to affect the purchasing decisions of consumers of newly constructed 
housing. Given this potential effect, EPA performed a regional-level analysis (i.e., level of Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas (MSA)) that estimates the number and fraction of potential single-family home buyers whose 
purchasing decision may be affected by the potential price of newly constructed, single-family housing. The 
results of the analysis are produced at the MSA-level and reported at the national-level by aggregating the total 
number of impacted households across all MSAs. Detailed state-level results are presented in Appendix 6-2. As 
described in Chapter 3, EPA performed this analysis at two home price levels: the median price and lower 
quartile price for new single-family homes, by MSA. Also, as described in Chapter 3, for this analysis, EPA 
assumed that compliance costs would be fully passed through to consumers in increased housing prices. This 
assumption is effectively contradictory to the assumptions of partial and no cost pass-through that underlie the 
analysis of firm and industry-level regulatory impacts.  
Performing this analysis at the level of the MSA, instead of at the national level, is important because of the 
substantial variation in home prices and household income – and ultimately, affordability effects – across MSAs 
in the United States. Table 5-5, which reports the 5th percentile, 95th percentile, and average of new single-family 
home prices from the set of median- and lower-quartile MSA prices used in the analysis, underscores this 
observation in relation to new home prices.

5.2.2.1  Results of the Median-Priced Single-Family Home Analysis 
Table 5-6 shows, by regulatory option, the estimated dollar value and percentage change in the price for a new 
single-family home and the number of households in the market for a new, median-priced single family home 
whose purchasing decision may be practically affected by the price change. The price increase assumes: (1) a 
compliance cost based on the median lot size, 0.23 acres, for all new single-family housing as reported in the 
Census of Housing and (2) that compliance costs are fully passed through as an increased price to the home 
purchaser.45 This table also shows the number of affected households as a percentage of the total number of home-
purchasing households that also qualify to purchase the median-priced home, before compliance cost effect. The 
key conclusion from this analysis is that, for all regulatory options, the total number of households incurring an 
affordability effect is small in comparison to the number of all likely single-family home buyers in any given year 
who can also afford the same home. For Option 2, this percentage is less than 0.1 percent.

Table 5-7 shows the effect of the estimated national average change in home prices on a typical monthly payment 
by comparing the baseline and post-compliance monthly payments for each option. For example, the median 
home price analysis shows increases in monthly payments of $1 for Option 1, $14 for Option 2, and $15 for 
Option 3. In each case, the percentage increase in the monthly payment due to regulatory requirements is low – 
for example, 0.69 percent for Option 2.

The marginal affordability effects for likely buyers of newly constructed, single-family homes – in this case, a 
median-priced home – as illustrated in Table 5-6 and Table 5-7, do not mean that these households would be 
unable to afford a single-family home, or even not be able afford the exact same new single-family home. Any

potentially affected home buyer has a number of avenues through which any price increase due to the regulation 
might be mitigated: 
¾ Price negotiation. The home buyer may be able to offset the price increase through negotiation of the 
sales price. 
¾ Attribute substitution. The home buyer may be able to mitigate the effect of the price increase through 
substitution (e.g., purchasing a new home with marginally different attributes, or effectively the same new 
home in a marginally different location). 
¾ Purchase deferment. The home buyer may be able to mitigate the effect of the regulation by increasing 
the down-payment so that the there is no change in what would have otherwise been the monthly 
payment. If the home buyer lacks the financial resources to increase the down-payment at the preferred 
time of purchase, the increase in the down-payment might be achieved by delaying the purchase, and 
saving from current income to reach the needed down-payment value. 
¾ Purchase a home whose price is not affected by the regulation. Each of the preceding adjustments 
involves changes to purchase the desired new, in-scope home. However, the prospective home buyer may 
be able to mitigate the effect of the price increase by purchasing a new or existing home whose price does 
not increase as a result of the regulation.46 
The purchase deferment mitigation option means that the purchaser might need to delay the home purchase long 
enough to save the requisite increase in the down-payment. Depending on a household’s income and the amount 
of time over which the household saves the additional funds, the impact on a given household’s disposable 
income will vary. For example, for any given amount to be saved, the fraction of income that would have to be 
set-aside over a 3-month period is twice the fraction of income set-aside if savings are accrued over a six-month 
deferment period.47 
Table 5-8, below, presents the fraction of household income required to be saved, to offset the effect of the 
regulation on the monthly mortgage payment via an increase in the initial down-payment. The table shows the 
fraction of income required to be saved in order to accumulate the increase in down-payment over 3, 6, and 12 
month periods. In each case, the income used in the calculation is the income at which the prospective home 
buyer would just be able to purchase the home at the baseline price under conventional financing criteria. The 
results show, for example, that under Option 2, a household would need to set-aside 5.7% of its income over a 6-
month period to offset the regulation’s effect on the mortgage payment. The fraction of income required to be 
saved decreases, for any savings time period, for households that earn income in excess of this minimum income 
requirement. Therefore, the required increases in down payment in this table are overstated to the extent that the 
income of households interested in purchasing the median-priced home exceeds the minimum income threshold 
value. 
                                                     
46  Such substitutes are expected to be readily available given that nearly 93% of single-family homes available in the market would not 
be expected to incur cost under Option 2.

5.2.2.2 Results of the Lower-Quartile-Priced Single-Family Home Analysis 
The mitigating factors described in the preceding section also apply to the lower-quartile home price analysis and 
are likely to reduce the ultimate practical effects of the regulation on single-family home buyers. But in addition, 
other qualifications in this analysis are critical for properly understanding the practical implications of whether 
and to what extent households – in particular low/moderate-income households and first-time home buyers – 
could be affected by the regulation: 
¾ Home price changes due to the regulation are likely to decrease with baseline home sales price. An 
important factor to be accounted for in the analysis for the lower-quartile price home is that the 
compliance cost burden and potential home price increase will typically be less for the lower-quartile 
price home than for the median price home. As a result, simply carrying forward the same price effect as 
used for the median price analysis will overstate the typical impact. This occurs because, as shown in 
Census data, lot size typically declines with price for new single-family homes, thereby reducing the 
compliance cost burden, which is directly associated with lot size, and the resulting price impact per 
home. As shown in Figure 5-1, Census data indicate that about half of new, lower priced single-family 
homes are constructed on lots less than 7,000 square feet, and this fraction declines as home price 
increases. Based on the Census data, lower-priced homes will often have lot sizes that are smaller than the 
median value used in the preceding analysis.48 To account for this factor, EPA performed the affordability 
analysis for the lower-quartile price home under two compliance cost/price effect cases:  
 Using the median lot size for all new single-family housing, 0.23 acres, which yields the same 
compliance cost and price effect as in Table 5-6, above 
 Using a smaller lot size that is based on the Census-reported median lot size of attached new single-
family housing, 0.08 acres (as described in Section 3.4.2), which yields a compliance cost and price 
effect that is approximately 64 percent less than under the median lot size case (see Table 5-9, below). 
                                                     
48  The home price and lot size resolution for this analysis are limited by the data ranges reported by the Census: “$125,000 and below” 
and is the lowest home price range reported, and “7,000 square feet and below” is the lowest lot size range reported.

¾ Low/moderate-income home buyers are less likely to purchase newly constructed single-family homes 
than higher income home buyers. The practical impact of the regulation on low/moderate-income (and 
first-time home buyers, to the extent these home buyers are more likely to have low/moderate incomes) is 
also probably overstated in the analysis because these households are less likely to purchase newly 
constructed housing than higher income home buyers. As reported in the 2005 American Housing Survey 
(HUD, 2006a), in any given income range, the fraction of home purchases that are new, generally 
increases with income (see Figure 5-2). This information indicates that, in general, households with 
higher incomes are more likely to purchase a new home than households with lower income.

In addition to these specific considerations for low/moderate-income and first-time home buyers, it is also 
important to emphasize again that this affordability analysis assumes 100 percent cost pass through of compliance 
costs from builders to consumers. This assumption implies that the demand for new housing is highly inelastic 
(all costs pass through as a price increase with no change in the equilibrium quantity of new housing sold or 
rented). Such conditions would generally be expected to prevail during relative “boom” periods in the market for 
housing (e.g., most recently in 2005 - 2006).49 While it is possible that a substantial fraction of compliance costs 
could be passed through to housing consumers, the actual fraction is expected to be less than 100 percent in the 
steady state. Moreover, during periods of relative “bust” periods (e.g., today’s housing market weakness), the 
ability of home builders to pass through compliance costs could be considerably curtailed. The key point is that 
cost pass-through, which is ultimately reflected in the supply and demand price elasticity for new housing, is – in 
the steady state – expected to be less than 100 percent due to several factors, including (1) the availability of 
substitutes for any given home, and (2) the determination that rule is only expected to affect a small fraction – 
about 7 percent under Option 2 – of the total number of single-family home sales.50 As such, to the extent that 
actual cost pass-through is less than 100 percent, the potential affordability effects for all home-buyers are 
overstated.  
Below, Table 5-9 and Table 5-10 present the results of the affordability analysis for the lower-quartile priced 
home. Table 5-9 reports, by regulatory option and for the two lot size cases outlined above, the estimated dollar 
value and percentage change in the price for a new single-family home and the number of households with an 
affordability effect. As expected, the number of households estimated to incur annually the affordability effect is 
                                                     
49  It should be noted that EPA’s use of 2006 home prices for the analysis, described in Chapter 3, is therefore consistent with the 
analysis’ assumption of 100% cost pass-through given that “peak” market conditions generally prevailed during 2006. It would have 
been a relatively poor assumption to associate 100% cost-pass-through with price and market conditions present currently. 
50  Based on 2006 home sales data, EPA estimates that approximately 470,000 new, single-family home sales would be expected to incur 
cost under Option 2 out of a total of approximately 6.7 million single-family home sales.

smaller under the smaller lot size case of 0.08 acres (based on the median lot size for attached new single-family 
housing) than under the larger lot size of 0.23 acres (based on the median lot size for all new single-family 
housing): under Option 2, the estimated number of affected households declines from 3,243 to 1,165. As 
described above, EPA judges that the smaller lot size provides a better basis for assessing the affordability effect 
for the lower-quartile price analysis than the larger lot size used in the analysis for the median price. Regardless of 
the lot size case, the number of affected home buyers is small in relation to the number of single-family home 
purchasers who qualify to purchase the lower-quartile price home in the baseline (e.g., about 0.03% to 0.08% of 
such households, depending on the lot size case).

Lastly, Table 5-11 presents the fraction of household income required to be saved to offset the effect of the

5.2.3 Social Cost of the Proposed Options 
EPA reported, in Section 5.2.1, the resource cost of compliance for each C&D industry sector and proposed 
option that was estimated using the firm-analysis methodology described in Chapter 3. The firm-level estimate 
compliance cost, however, does not account for the potential affect of the proposed options on the quantity of 
construction activity/units performed in the various C&D markets. The incremental cost of compliance for each 
proposed option has the effect of increasing builders’ costs and can cause an upward shift the market’s supply 
curve. Part of the increased costs may raise the price of new housing, with the balance of increased costs being 
absorbed by the builder, depending on the relative elasticities of supply and demand. The resulting shift in market 
equilibrium may also reduce the quantity of construction units produced in a given market. 
EPA estimated a state-by-state linear partial equilibrium market model for each C&D building sector to estimate 
this potential market effect on the quantity of output. EPA’s assumption that compliance costs are will result in 
only small marginal changes in prices and quantities provides the basis for assuming that the supply and demand 
curves are linear in the relevant range of market effect. The estimated change in the quantity of output produced in 
each C&D market segment is then used to not only adjust the firm-level resource cost of compliance, but also to 
compute the economic value of the reduction in C&D output, and estimate the total loss of consumer and 
producer surplus (e.g., deadweight loss). 
The total social cost of the regulatory options is comprised of the quantity-adjusted resource cost of compliance, 
the deadweight loss to society, and government administrative costs for reviewing and processing discharge 
monitoring reports (DMR). The results of the social cost analysis are presented in Table 5-12. 
For Option 1, the least costly option, the total social cost is approximately $132 million with the total dead weight 
loss under $1 million (approximately $40,000). For Option 2, the total social cost is approximately $1,887 million 
with approximately $3.5 million in dead weight loss. Option 3, the most costly option, has a total social cost of 
approximately $3,790 million with approximately $8.2 million in dead weight loss.

analysis of total economic effects is intended to account for inter-industry linkages in the national economy by 
estimating the magnitude of output and employment changes derived from both the resource cost of compliance, 
the direct change C&D industry output, and the output and employment effects resulting from administrative 
activities performed by Federal, State, and Local governments. EPA used input-output multipliers from BEA to 
estimate the total economic effects of each option on the overall U.S. economy. The results are presented in Table 
5-13. It is important to emphasize that the total economic effects reported below, whether derived from resource 
cost outlays or the change in C&D industry output, are not costs in addition to the social cost of the rule. The 
reported output and employment effects are manifestations of activity arising from social cost. Moreover, the 
reported employment effects should not be interpreted strictly as jobs created or jobs lost. Employment effects in 
this context is simply a conversion of economic activity into employment equivalents – EPA does not have any 
basis for knowing whether all, none, or some of these “jobs” will actually be created or lost.

5.2.5 Projections of Future Social Cost and Compliance Acreage through 2025 
This section presents a projection of total social cost based on to more accurately reflect the industry’s anticipated 
activity level during 2010, when the rule begins, and out to 2025. In this analysis, EPA takes into consideration 
the expected “phase-in” of compliance across over the first five years after promulgation as states renew their 
Construction General Permit, which will adopt and apply the provisions of this regulation to construction and 
development activities in their states (i.e., not all states will come into compliance during 2010; compliance will 
phase-in from 2010 to 2014).

5-16 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
The primary estimates of total social cost, based on industry activity in 2002 and the assumption of full 
compliance by states subject to each regulatory option, are reported in Table 5-12 as $132 million for Option 1, 
$1,887 million for Option 2, and $3,790 million for Option 3. The results presented below in Table 5-14 differ in 
two important ways: they account for the phase-in of compliance from 2010 – 2014 as states renew their CGPs, 
and they account for the expected change in industry activity from 2002 to each year from 2010 and beyond. In 
Table 5-14, the first year of full compliance is 2014 because this is the first year when all states will have renewed 
their CGPs, and the total cost of Option 2 is $2,178 million. The difference between the 2002-based estimate of 
$1,887 million and the estimate of $2,178 in 2014 is created by the expected increase in overall C&D industry 
activity. In 2010, the total cost of the regulatory options is expected to be $0 for Option 1, $173 million for Option 
2, and $284 million for Option 3.51

Table 5-15 presents EPA estimate of the annualized value of total social cost from 2010 – 2025, using both a 3% 
and 7% discount rate (in 2008 dollars). The annualized cost of Option 2 is $1,829 to $1,970 million, depending on 
the discount rate.

Appendix 5-2: Adverse Analysis Case – Summary of Results for the Firm-Level Impact Analysis 
Method for Determining the Adverse Analysis Case Variables and Model Firms 
EPA estimated firm- and industry-level impacts under an adverse analysis case according to the specifications 
detailed within Section 5.2.1.1. This case is meant to illustrate the potential industry-level impact of the regulatory 
options during periods when the C&D industry or a given sector within the industry is operating under adverse 
business conditions. The adverse analysis case differs from the primary analysis case as follows: 
1. Model firms are defined on the basis of financial statements taken from an adverse performance period, as 
outlined below. The baseline financial condition and performance are thus weaker than the baseline 
condition and performance as used for the primary analysis case. 
2. Model firms are assigned a higher cost of capital, reflecting more difficult credit and equity financing 
conditions during a period of business weakness, than the cost of capital used in the primary analysis 
case. 
3. Model firms are assumed to recover none of the cost of compliance through product price increases. 
4. The total operating level of the C&D industry and total construction activity subject to regulatory 
requirements are assumed to be less than the baseline activity estimates.  
To perform this analysis, EPA adjusted the baseline financial statements for each of the model firms and the total 
estimated activity level in the C&D industry. EPA used Census data on the value of construction for each of the 
three general industry sectors from 1990 to 2007 to select the adverse business conditions year underlying the 
model firm financial statements and also to estimate an average deviation from trend during adverse performance 
years.  
Figure 5-3 through Figure 5-5 present the actual and estimated trend values52 of construction from 1990 to 2007 
for the residential, non-residential, and non-building sectors. Figure 5-6 through Figure 5-8 present the average 
annual growth of construction and the actual percent change in construction value from the previous year from 
1990 to 2007 for the residential, non-residential, and non-building sectors. As described previously, Risk 
Management Association provides financial statement data by industry sector and revenue range for the data years 
following the line drawn during the 2002 period. The highlighted data years – 2007 for the residential sector and 
2003 for both the non-residential and non-building sectors – are the RMA data-years used to define the model 
firm financial statements for the adverse analysis case.

Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 5: EA Results 
5-30 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
Table 5-22 through Table 5-24 present the data used to determine the adverse analysis case variables for each 
general industry sector. RMA provides financial statement data for the years in bold. The highlighted data year 
(2007 for the residential sector and 2003 for both the non-residential and non-building sectors) is the year used to 
define the adverse analysis case.  
Each table presents, by year, the actual value of construction as reported by Census. EPA estimated an 
exponential trend line from the actual values and, for each year, determined the percent deviation from the trend 
based on the difference between the actual value and the estimated trend line value. EPA then assigned years into 
categories of at trend, above trend, and below trend based on a deviation from trend value (e.g., ± 2.5 percent for 
the residential sector) that assigned an approximately equal number of years from the 18-year period into each of 
the performance categories. This assignment is the primary basis for determining the adverse performance years.  
EPA also looked at the difference in actual year-to-year growth from average growth over the period as a 
secondary indicator of adverse performance years. In the same way as described for the difference from trend 
determination, EPA assigned years into at trend growth, above trend growth, and below trend growth categories 
based on a deviation from trend value (e.g., ± 5.5 percent for the residential sector) that assigned an approximately 
equal number of years from the 17 years of year-to-year growth values into each of the performance categories. 
The average growth rate for each sector is reported in Table 5-25.53 Similar to determining whether a data year is 
at, above, or below the trend line, a deviation variable allowing for an approximately equal distribution of at, 
above, and below data years is introduced to determine the years that are at, above, or below average growth. 
For the residential sector, the adverse analysis year is straightforward: 2007 is by far the poorest performance year 
for which RMA data are available.54 The choice of 2003 as the adverse analysis case year for the non-residential 
and non-building sectors is less obvious: each of years 2002, 2003, and 2004 show weak performance for the non-
residential sector and the non-building sector’s performance is relatively on-trend for the entire RMA data period. 
EPA based its choice of 2003 as the adverse case year for the non-residential and non-building sectors on 
inspection of the RMA data and determination that this year generally showed the weakest financial performance 
and condition metrics for all of the revenue ranges in these sectors.55 
                                                     
53  The average growth rate is an average of the annual percent change in the actual value of construction from 1990-1991 to 2006-2007. 
54  Financial data for full-year 2007 and part- or full-year 2008 were not available at the time of the analysis for the proposed regulation. 
For the analysis of the final regulation, EPA will update the financial data to include more current data (full-year 2007 and part- or 
full-year 2008), which are expected to show more adverse financial performance and condition as business conditions in the 
construction and real estate sectors further deteriorated.  
55  Examining RMA data confirmed EPA’s decision to use 2003 as the adverse analysis year for the non-building sector.

The data presented in Table 5-22 through Table 5-24 were also used to determine the average percentage deviation from the trend in the below trend line 
years by sector. EPA used this percentage value, presented in Table 5-25, in the adverse analysis case to adjust downward the baseline level of activity 
by sector, affecting total compliance costs accordingly. EPA also reduced the total number of firms by sector and revenue range expected to engage in 
compliance activities based on this estimated percentage deviation from trend.

Adverse Analysis Case Results 
As stated previously, the adverse analysis case assumes that firms in the C&D industry pass through none of the 
incremental compliance costs and uses the adverse business conditions case definition for model C&D firms. The 
adverse analysis case reflects the model firm financial statements drawn from the adverse analysis year (shown in 
Table 5-22 and Table 5-24) as well as the contraction in the C&D industry sectors and total costs due to 
incorporating the average deviation of construction activity from trend in adverse performance years. As a result 
of the contraction in the number of firms and total activity, total estimated compliance costs decreased by 
approximately 10 percent under all three regulatory options. The number of firms incurring costs also decreased 
for each option. The results for the adverse analysis case are presented in Table 5-26.  
With respect to the firms incurring costs that exceed 1 and 3 percent of revenues, the impacts under the adverse 
analysis case are exactly the same regardless of whether one accounts for the effect of cost pass-through. This is 
simply because the cost pass-through fraction is assumed to be 0% in the adverse case, and thus, the effect is the 
same as though cost pass-through had not been taken into account.

a Note the number of firms and compliance cost/activity for each option is less than that reported previously in Table 5-2 because the adverse analysis case 
reflects the expected contraction in the C&D industry sectors during years of relatively adverse business conditions, which is based on the estimated average 
deviation from trend in adverse years.

Table 5-27 reports the firm-level impacts under the adverse analysis case in comparison to the firm-level impacts 
under the general analysis case (originally reported in Table 5-2). As reported in this table, the total compliance 
cost, compliance acreage, and numbers of firms in-scope and incurring cost declines in the adverse analysis case. 
This finding results from the modeled contraction in the C&D industry during periods of relative economic/ 
market weakness. That is, because the total quantity of C&D industry activity is shown to contract during periods 
of adverse business conditions (i.e., based on the deviation from trend analysis above), so to is the expected 
quantity of in-scope industry activity.

Table 5-27 also reports the numbers of firms estimated to incur an economic/financial impact according to the 
various impact measures presented earlier in this chapter.  
Firms Incurring Costs in Excess of One or Three Percent of Revenue – Without Accounting for the Effect of Cost 
Pass-Through 
The comparison of the General and Adverse Conditions cases for this measure indicates: 
¾ The number of impacted firms in the adverse case cost-to-revenue analysis is less than the absolute 
number of impacted firms in the general analysis case. This is due to the effect of industry contraction 
described above. 
¾ However, the number of impacted firms as percentages of all firms and all in-scope firms do not change. 
This results from the assumed linear contraction in C&D industry activity during adverse conditions. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 5: EA Results 
5-36 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
Firms Incurring Costs in Excess of One or Three Percent of Revenue – Accounting for the Effect of Cost Pass-
Through 
When the cost-to-revenue impact measure is calculated accounting for the effect of cost pass-through, the impact 
results are very different between the two cases. Under the General Conditions Case, firms receive the benefit of 
the estimated cost pass-through as an offset to compliance costs. However, under the Adverse Conditions Case, 
the expected cost pass-through declines to zero. As a result, even though this cost-to-revenue analysis accounts 
for cost pass-through, the effect of cost pass-through is zero in the Adverse Conditions Case, and the numbers and 
percentages of firms affected Adverse Conditions Case remains the same as though cost pass-through was not 
accounted for. Looking at the firm-level impact on this basis – accounting for the effect of cost pass-through, but 
with cost pass-through set to zero for the Adverse Analysis Case – provides a more realistic assessment of the 
potential economic/financial impact of incurring compliance costs during a period weak industry performance.  
In short, looking at the impacts adjusted for the effect of cost pass-through in both cases provides a comparison 
that aligns better with the relative pass-through conditions that would be expected during general and adverse 
performance periods. This comparison indicates: 
¾ The impacts on firms in the Adverse Conditions Case cost-to-revenue analysis increases substantially 
under Options 2 and 3 when compared to the General Conditions Case analysis. This is due to the fact 
that cost pass-through in the General Conditions Case is 85% for residential sectors and 71% for non-
residential sectors, while cost pass-through is assumed to be 0% in the Adverse Conditions Case. In this 
comparison, the number of firms estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue increases from 
15 to 698 under Option 2, and from 39 to 2,233 under Option 3. At the 3 percent of revenue threshold, the 
impact numbers increase from 0 to 30 under Option 2, and from 0 to 132 under Option 3.  
¾ And because the number of firms operating in the industry in the Adverse Conditions Case is assumed to 
be less than in the General Conditions Case, the relative increase in percentages of total firms incurring 
the indicated impact is greater than the increase in numbers of affected firms. In other words, although 
there is a contraction in in-scope activity during periods of adverse market conditions, the differential 
effect of cost pass-through outweights this effect, causing a net increase in the number of impacted firms. 
Firms Incurring Financial Stress and Negative Business Value 
Similarly, a comparison of the impact metrics for firm financial performance – incurrence of financial stress and 
negative business value – shows a significant increase in firm impacts under the Adverse Conditions Case. As 
described previously, this is due to a combination of factors, including: weaker baseline firm financial 
performance, higher costs of debt and equity, and the assumed inability to pass through costs in the adverse 
analysis case. That said, even though the number and percentage of adversely affected firms increases under the 
adverse analysis case, these numbers and percentages of impacted firms remains quite low relative to the C&D 
industry as a whole.

6 Benefits Assessment Methodology and Results 
This chapter provides an overview of the potential benefits to society related to reduced sediment discharges from 
construction sites that will result from the C&D regulation. A more detailed discussion of EPA’s methodology 
and results from the benefits assessment can be found in the Environmental Impact and Benefits Assessment for 
Proposed Effluent Guidelines and Standards for the Construction and Development Category (USEPA 2008b), 
hereafter referred to as the Environmental Assessment Document.  
Sediments and other pollutants from construction sites may have a wide range of effects on water resources 
located in the vicinity of construction sites. These environmental changes affect economic productivity (e.g., 
navigation, water storage, and water treatment) as well as environmental services valued by humans (e.g., 
recreation, public and private property ownership, existence services such as aquatic life, wildlife, and habitat 
designated uses). Related market benefits (e.g., avoided costs of producing various market goods and services) 
and non-market benefits are additive (Freeman 2003). In all cases, benefits are conceptualized and estimated 
based on established welfare theoretic models (Freeman 2003; Just et al. 2004). 
EPA considered four categories of quantifiable monetary benefits from the C&D Regulation: 
¾ Benefits to Navigation (Section 6.1) – Navigable waterways are often dredged to maintain their navigable 
depth and width. Reduced sediment settling in navigable channels is expected to reduce the cost of 
dredging in these channels, as it is related to the amount of sediment dredged; 
¾ Benefits to Water Storage (Section 6.2) – Water storage facilities (reservoirs) may also be dredged in 
order to regain capacity lost to sediment build-up. Reduced sediment settling in reservoirs is expected to 
reduce the cost of dredging in reservoirs that are dredged; 
¾ Benefits to Drinking Water Treatment (Section 6.3) – Drinking water must be treated for sediment and 
turbidity, among other things, and the treatment costs are related to the sediment and turbidity levels of 
the influent water. Reducing sediment and subsequently the turbidity that must be treated by drinking 
water treatment plants reduces the amount of chemicals needed for treatment, and also the amount of 
sludge generated from this treatment that must be disposed, lowering the cost of drinking water treatment; 
and, 
¾ Water Quality Benefits (Section 6.4) – Reducing sediment levels in U.S. waterways has the general effect 
of improving water quality, as suspended sediment is one of the determinants of water quality. Increased 
water quality has both explicit and implicit value to users of water bodies, which was quantified using 
willingness-to-pay estimates based on a meta-analysis of existing willingness-to-pay studies for water 
quality. 
The total benefits resulting from the reduced sediment and turbidity levels in U.S. waters induced by this 
regulation is estimated as the sum of these four categories of monetary benefits. Total benefits are summarized in 
Section 6.5. Lastly, Section 6.6 summarizes the key uncertainties and limitations underlying the analyses. 
More details of the conceptual framework underlying this benefits assessment and a discussion of additional 
benefits categories not monetized can be found in Chapter 4 of the Environmental Assessment Document. EPA 
used the SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) model (USGS 2008) to 
predict changes in sediment loadings and concentrations resulting from expected reductions in construction site 
sediment discharges brought about by this regulation. Details of SPARROW can be found in Chapter 6 and 
Appendix A of the Environmental Assessment Document.

6.1 Analysis of Benefits to Navigation 
This section presents a summary of EPA’s analysis of the navigable waterway maintenance costs that would be 
avoided by implementation of the C&D regulation. Further details of this analysis and an expanded discussion of 
its results can be found in Chapter 7 of the Environmental Assessment Document. 
The analysis of benefits to navigation includes four primary steps:  
¾ Identify navigable waterways that are regularly dredged and estimate the frequency of dredging in each 
waterway; 
¾ Estimate the navigable waterway maintenance cost per cubic yard of sediment dredged;  
¾ Estimate the total cost of navigable waterway maintenance under the baseline and post-compliance 
scenarios and, 
¾ Estimate cost savings from decreased dredging of navigable waterways due to the reduction in sediment 
discharged from construction sites. 
This analysis presents low, mid, and high estimates for dredging, the cost of dredging, and reductions in these two 
areas in order to provide a range of benefits values. This range of values was determined by varying certain 
assumptions made about current and future dredging activity in U.S. navigable waterways. The details of the 
assumptions made for each range are summarized in Chapter 7 of the Environmental Assessment Document. 
The cost savings for each post-compliance scenario is calculated as the difference in total annualized dredging 
costs between the baseline and each post-compliance scenario, and will be considered as the benefits to navigation 
resulting from the C&D regulation. Table 6-1, Table 6-2, and Table 6-3 present annualized avoided cost estimates 
for navigable waterway dredging for each of The Agency’s regulatory options, including low, midpoint, and high 
estimates for cost reductions under each of these scenarios. Each of these estimates was calculated using both 3 
and 7 percent annual discount rates to discount and annualize costs. 
Annualized savings from reduced dredging activity range from $690,000 to $49.2 million, varying based on the 
regulatory option and estimate range. EPA estimates that Region 4 will benefit from the most substantial 
reductions in dredging costs under all regulatory options. This is due to a large amount of dredging activity in this 
region and a large percentage reduction in sediment discharges expected as a result of the C&D regulation. 
Region 6, though it does account for a large portion of dredging activity, does not represent as large a portion of 
the cost savings due to its substantially lower cost per unit of dredged material ($1.79, compared to $5.39 in 
Region 4) and a larger number of construction sites exempted by rainfall and soil type waivers. Due to the lack of 
significant dredging activity in Region 8, no benefits are expected in this region. 
Option 1, a construction general permit requiring sedimentation basins on all sites larger than 10 acres and the 
implementation of best management practices on smaller sites, is EPA’s least stringent regulatory option. It is 
predicted to produce a range of cost savings between $690,000 and $1.8 million. Under this regulatory option, 
Region 4 will have the most significant savings, accounting for almost all of the benefits under this option. This 
option does not predict any savings in Regions 7, 8, or 9. 
Option 2 imposes a turbidity standard on construction sites larger than 30 acres in areas that have an “R-factor” 
(see Chapter 3 and the USEPA 2008a for more details) of greater than 50 and with soils containing greater than 
10 percent small particles, and requires a construction general permit for all other sites. This option will prevent 
an estimated 3.3 million cubic yards of sediment from entering navigable water bodies and requiring dredging. 
The midpoint estimate for cost savings under this option is between $12.6 and $12.9 million per year, ranging 
from $8.9 million to $23.8 million between the low and high estimates. EPA expects more than 99 percent of 
these benefits to accrue to Regions 1 through 6, as many areas in Regions 7 through 10 are exempt through soil

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 6-3 
type or rainfall waivers provided by this option. Region 4 again represents a significant portion of savings, though 
Region 6 is also expected to benefit from a reduction of more than $1.6 million per year in dredging costs. 
Option 3, which imposes a turbidity standard on all sites larger than 10 acres (in addition to the requirements of 
Option 1) and requires a construction general permit for others, is EPA’s most stringent regulatory option. This 
option would require on-site treatment of stormwater, substantially reducing its contribution to in-stream TSS and 
turbidity. Cost savings from this action range between $18.7 and $49.2 million, with a midpoint estimate of $26.5 
to $27.2 million. Region 4 is again the largest beneficiary from this regulation, with $21.3 to $21.9 million in 
savings for the midpoint estimate, and Regions 3 and 6 also benefit from $1.0 to $1.1 million and $2.4 to $2.5 
million in cost savings, respectively, under this option. The largest changes from Option 2 come in Region 9, 
which had many areas exempt due to rainfall under Option 2. Region 10 also sees a substantial increase in its 
benefits under this option, with the midpoint estimates rising from just over $157,200 and $161,900 (7 percent 
and 3 percent discount rates, respectively) under Option 2 to $602,200 and $620,100, respectively, under Option 
3. 
Overall, Regions 4 and 6 are the largest beneficiaries of reduced dredging costs from this action, both in terms of 
cost savings and the amount of sediment prevented from entering and settling in navigable waterways. This is 
likely an effect of the large portion of coastline located in these regions and their large proportion of dredging 
activity.

6.2 Analysis of Benefits to Water Storage  
This section provides a summary of EPA’s analysis to estimate the benefits to water storage facilities from 
reduced sediment discharge. A more detailed description of this analysis can be found in Chapter 8 of the 
Environmental Assessment Document. 
The analysis of these benefits includes the following steps: 
¾ Estimating the unit cost of sediment removal from reservoirs assumed to be dredged; 
¾ Estimating the sediment accumulation in reservoirs under the baseline scenario and the post-compliance 
regulatory scenarios and the amount expected to be dredged; and, 
¾ Estimating the cost savings from decreased dredging of reservoirs due to the reduction in sediment 
discharged from construction sites. 
Due to a lack of data on the frequency of reservoir dredging, EPA varied the assumed frequency of dredging 
between 2, 6, and 10 years to produce a range of avoided cost estimates. More details of this sensitivity analysis 
can be found in Chapter 8 of the Environmental Assessment Document. 
The difference between the anticipated dredging costs under the baseline and a particular post-compliance 
scenario represents the cost savings of that particular scenario. Table 6-4, Table 6-5, and Table 6-6 present 
reductions in sedimentation and subsequent avoided costs from reduced reservoir dredging for the three post-
compliance regulatory scenarios, including low, midpoint, and high estimates under each of these scenarios. 
Cost savings from a reduction in reservoir sedimentation range from $470,000 to $32 million, with EPA’s Option 
2 representing a savings of $17.6 million the midpoint estimate assuming a 3% discount rate, $15.9 million at a 
7% rate. The largest savings are predicted in Region 4 under all options, as SPARROW predicts the largest 
overall reductions in sediment accumulation in this region. Region 4 accounts for nearly 98% of all savings under 
Option 1, and more than 50% in both Options 2 and 3. Region 6 is also anticipated to benefit from savings 
between $4.3 and $4.8 million under Option 2, and by between $6.5 and $7.4 million under Option 3. 
Option 1, a construction general permit requiring sedimentation basins on all sites larger than 10 acres and the 
implementation of best management practices on smaller sites, is EPA’s least stringent regulatory option. As 
noted above, Region 4 is the only region to benefit significantly from this regulatory option, and accounts for 
$593,000 of the $606,000 in cost savings for the midpoint estimate of this option assuming a 3% discount rate, 
and $536,000 out of $548,000 at a 7% rate. 
Option 2 imposes a turbidity standard on construction sites larger than 30 acres in areas that have an “R-factor” 
(see Chapter 3 and the Technical Development Document for more details) of greater than 50 and have soils 
containing greater than10 percent small particles, and requires a construction general permit for all other sites. 
Cost savings under this option range between $13.7 and $18.7 million, with an expected value of $17.6 million 
assuming a 3% discount rate ($15.9 million at 7%). This option greatly increases expected savings for all regions, 
reducing reservoir sedimentation rates by more than 5 million kilograms per year in eight regions, and by more 
than 100,000 cubic yards per year in five of these regions. Region 4 is predicted to have a large portion of the 
savings, though Region 6 is also expected to benefit from $3.6 to $4.8 million dollars of reduced dredging costs 
each year. Region 7 has the next largest portion of savings, benefiting by at least $1.2 million in the midpoint 
estimate. The Agency expects the smallest reductions in reservoir sedimentation in Regions 8 and 9, where many 
sites will be exempt due to rainfall or soil type waivers. Both of these regions will experience a decline of 10,000 
cubic yards or less per year in the midpoint estimate of reservoir sedimentation.

Option 3, which imposes a turbidity standard on all sites larger than 10 acres (in addition to the requirements of 
Option 1) and requires a construction general permit for others, is EPA’s most stringent regulatory option. This 
option would require on-site treatment of stormwater, substantially reducing its contribution to in-stream TSS and 
turbidity. Expected cost savings from this action range between $23.8 and $32.5 million, with midpoint estimates 
of $30.6 million at 3% and $27.6 million at 7%. Region 4 is again the largest beneficiary from this regulation, 
with around $16.4 million in savings for the midpoint estimate assuming a 3% discount rate, and $14.8 million 
assuming a 7% discount rate. Region 6 is also estimated to benefit substantially from this regulation, with a 
reduction between $5.4 and $7.4 million. The drier Regions 8 and 9, which have many areas exempt under Option 
2, are expected to benefit much more substantially under Option 3, with expected savings in Region 9 more than 
ten times greater under Option 3 than under Option 2 and more than seven times greater in Region 8. Overall cost 
savings under this regulatory option nearly double for all estimate ranges. 
Overall, Regions 4 and 6 are the largest beneficiaries of reduced dredging costs from this action, with substantial 
cost and sedimentation reductions also occurring in Regions 7 and 10 under Options 2 and 3. These two options 
are expected to result in significantly higher savings than Option 1, and are also anticipated to provide a more 
even distribution of these avoided cost benefits among regions.

6.3 Analysis of Benefits to Drinking Water Treatment 
This section summarizes the estimation of the total expenditures to remove sediments from drinking water and the 
cost savings expected with the reduction of sediment discharges anticipated from the C&D regulation. Further 
details of this analysis and an expanded discussion of its results can be found in Chapter 9 of the Environmental 
Assessment Document. The cost of drinking water treatment followed the following steps: 
¾ Identifying RF1 reaches modeled by SPARROW that are sources for drinking water treatment plants; 
¾ Determining TSS reductions in these reaches; 
¾ Estimating the chemical cost of treating the turbidity caused by TSS in these reaches; 
¾ Estimating the cost of disposing of the sludge generated from this turbidity treatment; 
¾ Estimating the total costs of drinking water treatment under the baseline and post-compliance scenarios; 
and,  
¾ Estimating the cost savings from decreased drinking water treatment costs due to the reduction in 
sediment discharged from construction sites. 
To address uncertainty in its assumptions, EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis that varies assumptions about the 
treatment of highly turbid influent water and the cost of chemical inputs, and the results of the following analyses 
present low, midpoint, and high benefits estimates (see Chapter 9 of the Environmental Assessment Document for 
details). 
The total cost savings from lowered turbidity resulting from lower TSS concentrations in drinking water influent 
was estimated as the difference between drinking water turbidity treatment under the baseline and post-
compliance scenarios. Reductions in drinking water treatment costs for the three post-compliance regulatory 
scenarios are presented in Table 6-7, Table 6-8, and Table 6-9.  
The anticipated savings from reduced TSS and turbidity treatment at drinking water facilities are between 
$181,900 and $14.5 million, varying substantially between the least and most stringent regulatory options and 
also less dramatically between the low and high estimates. EPA’s Option 2 is expected to reduce TSS and 
turbidity treatment costs for drinking water facilities by between $2.9 and $8.0 million. As is the case with 
navigable waterway and reservoir dredging, Region 4 benefits most significantly and consistently from the TSS

November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 6-9 
reductions expected from this regulatory action. The avoided costs in Region 4 under Regulatory Option 1 
account for more than 90 percent of the total national savings. Other regions receive a larger portion of benefits 
under Regulatory Options 2 and 3, though Region 4 still accounts for the greatest proportion of the cost 
reductions. Regions 6 and 10 also show significant savings under Options 2 and 3, with savings in these regions 
between greater than $1 million in all estimates for these two options.  
Option 1, a construction general permit requiring sedimentation basins on all sites larger than 10 acres and the 
implementation of best management practices on smaller sites, is EPA’s least stringent regulatory option. Region 
4 receives the only considerable cost savings under this option, between $170,500 and $200,00. Savings in 
Regions 2, 5, and 8 are between $1,000 and $10,000, and in all other regions, expected cost reductions are less 
than $1,000. 
Option 2, imposes a turbidity standard on construction sites larger than 10 acres in areas that have an “R-factor” 
(see Chapter 3 and the Technical Development Document for more details) of greater than 50 and with soils 
containing greater than 10 percent small particles, and requires a construction general permit for all other sites. 
For the midpoint estimate of EPA’s Option 2, the national average reduction in treated turbidity is 1.7 NTU, 
though in Region 4 (where many of the benefits are expected) the reduction is more than 6 NTU. Region 10 is 
expected to benefit from an average reduction of 15.9 NTU in influent water turbidity, though its expected 
savings are lower than those in Region 4 due to the lower number of affected facilities in Region 10. The expected 
value of avoided costs for this estimate is $7.4 million. Estimated savings exceed $1 million in Regions 4 and 6, 
and 10. These savings are much greater than the near-zero savings expected under Option 1 for Regions 6 and 10. 
Regions 8 and 9 do not benefit as substantially as other regions, likely due to a large number of sites being 
exempted from the turbidity standard, which would otherwise shift turbidity treatment costs from the drinking 
water treatment facility to the construction site. 
Option 3, which imposes a turbidity standard on all sites larger than 10 acres (in addition to the requirements of 
Option 1) and requires a construction general permit for others, is EPA’s most stringent regulatory option. This 
option would require on-site treatment of storm water, substantially reducing its contribution to in-stream TSS 
and turbidity. Total avoided costs for this option are between $10.4 and $14.5 million, with a midpoint estimate 
around $13.1 million. The drier Regions 8 and 9, which have many areas exempt under Option 2, are expected to 
benefit much more substantially under Option 3. Estimated avoided costs in these regions are six to eleven times 
larger under this option, though still much lower than in other regions.  
As construction site discharges are more likely to contain smaller particles that contribute less to TSS and more to 
turbidity, the high estimates for Options 2 and 3 may be more relevant because EPA uses a conversion factor 
between TSS and turbidity that takes this into account. The high estimate for turbidity reductions under Option 2 
is 7.2 NTU nationwide, with a reduction of nearly 13 NTU in Region 4, and nearly 12 NTU in Region 6. Under 
Option 3, the high estimate is on average around 11.2 NTU nationwide, 22.2 NTU in Region 4, and 16.7 NTU in 
Region 6. 
Overall, Regions 4, 6, and 10 receive the largest proportion of the cost reductions from reduced turbidity in 
drinking water. Options 2 and 3 produce significantly larger cost savings than Option 1, which is expected to 
reduce treatment costs by only about $211,400 nationally (midpoint estimate). Midpoint estimates of avoided 
costs under Options 2 and 3 are $7.4 and $13.1 million, respectively, and are expected to distribute these savings 
more evenly among the 10 regions, though with the aforementioned regions benefiting most due to a more 
substantial effect of the C&D regulation in these regions.

6.4 Analyzing the Benefits of Water Quality Improvement  
As discussed in the preceding sections of this chapter, sediments and other pollutants from construction sites may 
have a wide range of effects on water resources located in the vicinity of the construction sites. The environmental 
changes affecting environmental services valued by humans are monetized in the preceding sections. Non-market 
benefits or existence services such as aquatic life, wildlife, and habitat designated use (Freeman 2003) need to be 
considered in addition to market benefits (e.g., avoided costs of producing various market goods and services). 
To link water quality changes from reduced sediment runoff to effects on human uses and support for aquatic and 
terrestrial species habitat, this analysis utilizes a water quality index (WQI) based on the one developed by 
McClelland (1974), which EPA has modified to rely on fewer parameters (U.S. EPA 2002, EPA 2004a). This 
index is linked to specific pollutant levels, which in turn are linked to the presence of aquatic species and 
suitability for particular recreational uses. The WQI allows the use of objective water quality parameters (e.g., 
dissolved oxygen concentrations) to characterize ecosystem services or uses provided by a given water body. The 
WQI is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is poor quality and 100 is excellent. The complete description 
and associated equations and tables can be found in Chapter 10 of the Environmental Assessment Document. 
This section describes the use of meta-analysis of surface water valuation studies for estimating benefits of water 
quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation. The technical details involved in the estimation of 
original meta-analyses are presented in Chapter 10 and Appendix A of the Environmental Assessment Document 
as well as in sources such as Johnston et al. (2005; 2006), Bateman and Jones (2003), Shrestha et al. (2007), 
Rosenberger and Phipps (2007), and U.S. EPA (2004c). 
6.4.1 Estimated Changes in Water Quality (∆WQI) from the C&D Regulation 
To estimate benefits of water quality improvements expected from the C&D regulation, EPA estimated WQI for 
each regulatory option. In calculating the post-compliance WQI, the Agency used option-specific TSS 
concentrations from the SPARROW output. The sediment loading estimates for each regulatory option reflect the 
expected reduction in sediment runoff under the regulatory options. The other contributing parameters to the WQI 
were held constant for all regulatory options.  
Each RF1 reach that has an improved WQI value from the baseline scenario to a regulatory option contributes to 
the estimated economic benefits. Based on the estimated WQI value under the baseline scenario, EPA categorized 
each RF1 reach using four WQI ranges (WQI < 25, 25≤WQI<50, 50≤WQI<70, and 70≤WQI). WQI values of less 
than 25 indicate that water is not even suitable for boating (the recreational use with the lowest required WQI), 
whereas WQI values greater than 70 indicate that waters are swimmable (the recreational use with the highest 
required WQI). For each WQI category under the baseline scenario and regulatory options in a given state, EPA 
estimated weighted average WQI using river miles as weights.  
The difference in WQI between baseline conditions and a given rulemaking scenario is a measure of the change in 
water quality attributable to the regulatory option. To monetize benefits of the C&D regulation, EPA used three 
ranges of water quality improvements ∆WQI≤0.1, 0.1<∆WQI≤0.5, 0.5< ∆WQI. For each combination, of the 
baseline water quality category and the improvement range, the Agency estimated average ∆WQI and the 
corresponding percentage of total river miles in the state.  
Table 6-10, Table 6-11, and Table 6-12 summarize changes in ambient water quality resulting from the C&D 
regulation. Appendix D of the Environmental Assessment Document provides more detail on water quality 
improvements by the baseline WQI range. EPA estimated that Option 1 is not expected to result in significant 
water quality improvements at the regional level with improvements in only 9,325 river miles or 1.6 percent of 
the 585,368 river miles included in the analysis. EPA Region 4 is essentially the only geographic region that 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
6-12 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
shows any significant water quality improvements with 9,177 RF1 miles (10.5 percent of indexed RF1 miles that 
recive C&D discharge) being affected. Region 5 is expected to have the next largest water quality improvement 
with 96 RF1 miles being affected under the post-compliance scenario.  
EPA’s Option 2 is estimated to improve ambient water quality in 111,418 (19.0 percent) RF1 miles nationwide. 
EPA’s Regions 2, 3, and 4 are estimated to improve water quality in 35 percent or more of total RF1 miles. EPA’s 
water quality analysis predicts that Regions 3 and 4 will experience most improvements in terms of both RF1 
miles (18,844 and 48,229) and percent of total regional river length (64.6 percent and 55.2 percent). EPA’s 
analysis also indicates that Region 4 would benefit the most in terms of the estimated magnitude of water quality 
improvements with 5.5 percent of indexed RF1 miles estimated to improve by greater than 0.5 WQI units. 
Conversely, EPA Region 8 is estimated to improve the least, with 0.3 percent of river miles benefiting from 
higher water quality.  
Option 3 yields the most significant results overall in terms of RF1 miles expected to improve under the post-
compliance scenario at136,488. The estimated scale of improvements range from 3.6 percent to 71.4 percent of 
RF1 miles that receive C&D discharge in EPA’s Region 8 and 3, respectively. EPA estimated that Region 4 will 
experience the largest water quality improvement by river miles with 54,727 RF1 miles (62.7 percent of indexed 
RF1 miles) affected. EPA’s analysis also shows that Region 4 will have the most RF1 miles (8,486) improving by 
greater than 0.5 WQI units. The Agency estimates that Region 9 will have the lowest water quality improvements 
with 2,193 miles showing any improvement under the post-compliance scenario. Table 6-12 presents water 
quality improvements by river miles according to water quality under the baseline scenario for each of EPA’s 
regulatory options. A more detailed table describing these changes by EPA region, as well as discussion of these 
results can be found in Chapter 10 of the Environmental Assessment Document.

6.4.2 Benefits of Water Quality Improvements  
To estimate non-market benefits of water quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation, EPA used a 
benefits transfer function based on meta-analysis results presented in Appendix D of the Environmental 
Assessment Document. The general approach follows standard methods illustrated by Johnston et al. (2005) and 
Shrestha et al. (2007), among many others (see Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). This function allows the Agency 
to forecast WTP based on assigned values for model variables, chosen to represent a resource change in the C&D 
policy context.  
Table 6-13 presents mean values and confidence interval boundaries of household WTP for water quality 
improvements resulting form reduced sediment discharges from construction sties by EPA region and regulatory 
option.

a EPA used the Krinsky and Robb (1986) procedure to estimate the lower and upper bound value of the non-use component of total WTP for each region, based 
on the results of the total WTP regression model. The Agency notes that this analysis provides confidence limits for WTP estimates related to the covariance 
matrix of meta-analysis parameter estimates. 
EPA Estimates 
 
As shown in Table 6-13 the estimated national average household WTP for water quality improvements resulting 
from the regulation range from $0.15 to $3.50 per household.. The estimated WTP values vary greatly across EPA 
regions depending on the regulatory option and the level of construction activity in a given region. Chapter 10, 
Section 10.1.3 of the Environmental Assessment Document provides detail on water quality improvements 
estimated to accrue from the C&D regulation. 
EPA estimates that the least stringent regulatory option (Option 1) is not expected to result in significant water 
quality improvements across all EPA regions. Region 4 is the only geographic region that shows any significant 
water quality improvements. The estimated WTP per household in Region 4 has a 10 percent lower bound of 
$0.21 per household and a 90 percent upper bound of $1.54 per household, with an average WTP of $0.70. The 
estimated WTP for water quality improvements in Regions 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 is negligible. Nationwide, 
household WTP has a mean value of $0.15 and 90 percent confidence interval bounds ranging from $0.04 to 
$0.32. 
Option 2 is estimated to improve ambient water quality in 19.0 percent RF1 river miles nationwide. The estimated 
national average WTP for water quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation is $2.59 per household 
per year. Regions 3 and 4 are estimated to see improvements in water quality in more than 40 percent of their total 
RF1 river miles. EPA’s analysis indicates that Region 3 households would be willing to pay the most ($5.90 per 
household per year) for water quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation. Region 4 has the second

largest household WTP of, $5.12. Conversely, households located in Region 8 are estimated to have the lowest 
estimated WTP for water quality improvements from the C&D regulation, $0.04.   
The most stringent option (Option 3) yields the most significant results overall in terms of RF1 miles expected to 
improve under the post-compliance scenario. The estimated scale of improvements ranges from 3.6 percent to 
71.4 percent of total RF1 river miles in Region 8 and 3, respectively. Nationwide, the 90 percent confidence 
interval for the estimated per-household WTP has a 10 percent lower bound of $1.33 and a 90 percent upper 
bound of $7.59, with a mean value of $3.50. 
6.4.3 Estimating Total WTP for Water Quality Improvements 
For each regulatory option, EPA calculated state-level WTP as follows First EPA estimated mean state-level per-
household WTP for each combination of the baseline water quality category (WQI baseline) and the expected change 
in WQI (∆WQI)). Then, the Agency assigned each reach in the analysis a mean household WTP value based on 
reach location, baseline water quality, and change in water quality. The WTP was then multiplied by the number 
of households in a given state in 2006 and the percentage of river miles in that state that comprise a given 
reach.The number of households per state was calculated by taking U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 
2006 for each state and dividing by average number of people per household for a given state as reported in U.S. 
Census Bureau (2006a, 2006b). The total WTP equation for each reach is provided below (Eq. 1): 
)),( erMilesPercentRivStateHHWQIWQIWTPTWTP baselinereach ××∆=  (Eq. 1) 
Where: 
TWTPreach = the reach-level welfare change from improved water quality  
WTP = the estimated state-level per-household WTP for water quality improvement for a 
given combination of the baseline water quality category (WQI baseline) and the 
expected change in water quality under the post-compliance scenario (∆ WQI) 
StateHH = the number of households in a given state 
PercentRiverMiles = the percentage of total river miles that are comprised of a given reach 
Finally, EPA aggregated reach-level benefits to the regional level. The regional benefits for the 10 EPA regions 
were then combined to calculate the national benefit of the regulation. Table 6-14 presents estimated benefits of 
the C&D regulation by EPA region and regulatory option.

EPA Estimates 
 
From this analysis, EPA estimates that the mean values for total annual benefits of water quality improvements 
range from $16.57 million under Option 1 to $398.53 million under Option 3. The estimated mean regional 
benefits vary from $0.00 to $163.74 million per year, depending on the level of construction activity and average 
rainfall in a given region and stringency of the regulatory option.  
As shown in Table 6-14, the least stringent option (Option 1) is not expected to result in significant water quality 
improvements in many EPA regions. Thus, this option yields the smallest benefits at the regional and national 
levels. The national benefits of water quality improvements under this option have a 10 percent lower bound 
estimate of $4.93 million, a 90 percent upper bound estimate of $36.63 million, and a national average of $16.57 
million.  Region 4 gains the most benefit from water quality improvement, with a total value of $16.10 million 
(97 percent of the total national benefits). Region 5 has the second largest benefits ($0.28 million), Region 5 
benefits account for 1.7 percent of the total national benefits. 
Under Option 2, the average national benefits are $295.01 million. The 90 percent confidence interval has a 10 
percent lower bound of $104.60 million and a 90 percent upper bound value of $634.72 million.  Region 4 gains 
the most benefits from water quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation ($118.34 million). EPA 
Region 8 receives the least amount of benfits, $0.17 million,  
Under Option 3, the estimated mean national benefits of water quality improvement from the regulation are 
$398.53 million with a 10 percent lower bound of $151.53 and a 90 percent upper bound of $863.49 million.  As 
with the other options, Region 4 receives the most benefit from water quality improvements, accounting for 41 
percent ($163.74 million) of the total national benefits. Region 8 is anticipated to gain least under this Option 3, 
with the total regional benefits estimated at $2.25 million per year. 
6.5 Estimating Total Monetized Benefits 
EPA estimated the total benefits under each post-compliance regulatory scenario by summing the benefits 
estimated for each of the four categories above. Table 6-15 presents low, midpoint, and high estimates of benefits 
under each regulatory option, consisting of benefits to navigation, to water storage, to drinking water treatment, 
and willingness to pay. It should be noted that these tables incorporate the confidence intervals of 10, 50, and 90 
percent from the WTP analysis into the low, mid, and high sensitivity analyses performed for the avoided cost 
estimates. Though these are conceptually different, they are both intended to present a range of values to account 
for some of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates. The sensitivity analyses create a range by varying EPA’s 
assumptions underlying the analysis, while the confidence interval presents high and low bounds from the meta-
analysis regression.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 6-19 
Table 6-16, Table 6-17, and Table 6-18 details total benefits by EPA region, regulatory option, and estimate 
range. These tables present benefits for navigable waterway dredging and water storage calculated using both 3 
and 7 percent discount rates. Benefits for for drinking water and WTP were calculated using a single year 
timeframe and did not require annualizing. Total national benefits vary significantly among the three regulatory 
options: under Option 1, the estimated benefits range from approximately $6 million to about $39 million, while 
benefits under Option 3 are estimated to range from $209.6 million to $956.1 million ($204.4 million to $959 
million using a 7 percent discount rate). 
As shown in Table 6-15, under EPA’s preferred regulatory option (Option 2), the estimated benefits range from 
around $133 and $136 million to between $684 and $685 million. The midpoint estimate is between $330.9 and 
$332.9 million, depending on the assumed discount rate. Non-market benefits estimated based on household WTP 
for surface water quality improvements account for the majority of total benefits from the C&D regulation. The 
estimated WTP for water quality improvements from reduced sediment discharges from construction sites under 
Option 2 ranges from $104.6 to $634.7 million with a mean value of $295.0 million. The estimated cost savings to 
industry and government through reduced costs of navigable waterway maintenance, reservoir dredging, and 
drinking water treatment ranges from $28.3 and $31.3 million to $48.8 and $50.1 million per year, with midpoint 
estimates of $35.9 to $37.9 million. Under Option 2, avoided cost benefits account for 7 to 23 percent of total 
benefits.  
Under the most stringent option (Option 3), the expected cost savings are between $67.3 and $70.9 million per 
year; WTP also increases to a mean value of $398.5 million. The estimated midpoint total national benefits are 
between $465.8 and $469.5 million per year.

Table 6-16, Table 6-17, and Table 6-18 detail total benefits by EPA region, regulatory option, and estimate range. 
Region 4 benefits the most from this regulation regardless of which regulatory option is chosen, as it experiences 
the largest reduction in sediment discharges which are expected to produce larger cost savings and water quality 
improvements.  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
6-20 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
Under Option 1, a CGP for all sites and sediment basin requirements for large sites, total benefits range between 
approximately $6 million in the low estimate and $39 million in the high estimate, with a midpoint estimate of 
approximately $18 million, regardless of the assumed discount rate. Region 4 is the sole region with expected 
benefits totaling more than $1 million, with estimates ranging from $6 to $38 million. The estimated benefits for 
other regions are modest at best, with midpoint estimates ranging from less than $500 to just under $291,000 
annually. EPA’s analysis shows that Option 1 would generate less than $500 in annual benefits in Region 10  
Option 2, which adds a turbidity standard to the regulation for certain construction sites, is expected to result in 
significant benefits in all regions. EPA expects total benefits under this option to be approximately $333 million, 
with a range of $136 to $684 million. Under this regulatory option, Regions 2 through 6 benefit most 
substantially, with Region 4 alone accounting for more than 41 percent of the total national benefits anticipated 
under this option. Region 10 is also expected to benefit by about $13 million in the midpoint estimate. The 
Agency expects benefits for this option to be substantially larger than those under Option 1, because the turbidity 
standard will target construction site stormwater effluent that is likely to produce the highest benefits in terms of 
TSS and turbidity reductions. However, areas of the country with low rainfall or low percentage of clay in their 
soils, such as Regions 8 and 9, do not benefit as significantly because many sites in these areas are likely to 
qualify for waivers of the turbidity standard. Conversely, construction sites are not likely to affect sediment or 
turbidity pollution on a large scale in these regions. 
The stringent Option 3, under which all large sites are required to meet an effluent turbidity standard, increases 
the midpoint estimate of total national benefits by 41 percent, and is expected to produce the most substantial 
increases over Option 2 in Regions 8 and 9, where many areas are exempt from the turbidity standard under that 
option. The Agency’s midpoint estimates for benefits in these regions under Option 3 are approximately $2.6 
million and $10.2 million, respectively. Option 3 is expected to generate benefits of $469 million, with a range of 
$210 to $956 million between the low and high estimates assuming a 3% discount rate; at a 7% discount rate 
benefits range between $204 and $960 million, with an expected value of $466 million. 
Reductions in sediment pollution originating from construction site stormwater discharges are anticipated to 
reduce TSS and turbidity levels in waterbodies across the country, reducing costs of dredging navigable 
waterways and reservoirs and of drinking water treatment, as well as leading to improvements in water quality 
that benefit the general public. The value of these improvements derives directly from the magnitude of the 
sediment and turbidity reduction in waterbodies receiving construction site stormwater effluent.

EPA Estimates 
 
6.6 Sources of Uncertainty and Limitations 
Total national benefit estimates of the C&D regulation are subject to the limitations and uncertainties inherent in 
the valuation approaches used for assessing benefits to navigation, water storage, drinking water treatment, and 
non-market benefits of water quality improvement. Because the combined effect of these limitations and 
uncertainties is likely to underestimate national level of benefits of this regulation, the estimated benefits should 
be interpreted in the context of these limitations. Additional uncertainties and limitations specific to each category 
of monetized benefits are subsequently discussed. 
6.6.1 Water Quality Model Limitations  
To estimate benefits of reduced sediment loadings to surface water, EPA relied on SPARROW (SPAtially 
Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes). The SPARROW model for suspended sediments has a number 
of limitations, some of which are inherent to the methodology and some the result of the particular model 
application. The key model limitations are: 
¾ Reliance on the Reach File 1 network. While the RF1 network provides reasonably comprehensive 
national coverage of major rivers, streams and other surface water bodies, coverage is limited in certain 
important respects. RF1 network coverage is limited to the conterminous U.S., thus excluding Alaska and 
Hawaii. In addition, while RF1 1:500,000-scale network reaches have associated data or estimates of 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
6-22 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
stream discharge and velocity that are required to specify the SPARROW model; the network excludes 
the majority of the nation's total stream mileage, and smaller streams in particular. The linear coverage of 
the RF1 network is approximately 700,000 miles (www.epa.gov/waterscience/basins/metadata/rf1.htm). 
By contrast, coverage of the USGS National Hydrographic Dataset, at 1:24,000 - 1:100,000 scale, is 
currently over 7 million miles (USGS 2007). Given that RF1 accounts only for 10% of the total river 
miles, the impacts of construction-related sediment on smaller stream reaches are likely to be significantly 
understated. As construction activities may be concentrated along lower-order streams not included in the 
RF1 network, the relative share of total sediments contributed by construction activities may be high on 
these reaches during active construction phases. By contrast, the specific impacts of construction 
activities may diminish in importance relative to contributions from spatially extensive and diffuse land 
uses, including agriculture, at the level of RF1 reaches. 
¾ Omission of coastal waters from the analysis of monetized benefits. The SPARROW model does not 
allow prediction of water quality changes in coastal waters. Therefore, all coastal waters in the U.S. 
(10,630 shoreline miles) are omitted from the analysis of monetized benefits.56 Because the estimated 
willingness to pay for water quality improvements is a function of the total river and shoreline miles that 
are expected to improve from reduced sediment discharges, this omission is likely to lead to 
understatement of the estimated willingness to pay for water quality improvements resulting from the 
C&D rule. 
¾ Omission of all ponds and lakes and reservoirs located off RF1 network from water quality 
analysis. All lakes, ponds, and reservoirs located off RF1 network are not included in the SPARROW 
model and thus are excluded from estimation of monetized benefits. The 2002 National Water Quality 
Inventory: Report to Congress (U.S. EPA 2007) reports 40.6 million acres of lakes and reservoirs in the 
conterminous U.S. The RF1 network includes approximately 3.9 million acres or 9.5 % of the total lakes 
and reservoir acres in the U.S.57 (U.S. EPA 2007). Omission of these water body types from the analysis 
of monetized benefits is likely to lead to understatement of benefits in two benefit categories: (1) 
nonmarket benefits of water quality improvements resulting from the C&D regulation and (2) reservoir 
dredging. 
¾ Restriction of the water quality analysis to the description of long-term mean water quality 
conditions. Construction activities are, by contrast, transient in nature, extending over weeks or months. 
Construction activities (unlike agricultural activities) are spatially compact, so they are sub-grid 
phenomenon with respect to the specification of the national scale of the sparrow model. The restriction 
to mean water quality conditions precludes an analysis of the frequency with which conditions of extreme 
sediment transport conditions (e.g., during an active construction period) occur. Although the predicted 
changes in average water quality conditions may be small, the expected changes in sediment 
concentrations under extreme sediment transport conditions may be significant. The analysis also predicts 
average water quality conditions in a reach that are representative of the center line of that reach. TSS 
concentrations near shore are likely to be higher and the expected changes in ambient water quality 
conditions near shore are likely to be greater. 
¾ Focus on one pollutant of concern (sediment). Existing case studies of environmental impacts 
associated with construction activities demonstrated that a number of pollutants are found in construction 
site discharges, including turbidity, nitrogen, phosphorus, BOD, metals, toxic organics, trash and debris, 
and as well as other miscellaneous pollutants (see Chapter 3 of the Environmental Assessment Document 
                                                     
56 EPA was able to estimate ambient concentrations of sediment [Total Suspended Solids (TSS)] within estuaries using SPARROW output 
in conjunction of the Dissolved Concentration Potential (DCP) approach (U.S. EPA 1997). However, estuarine reaches were not included 
in estimation of monetized benefits due to time constraint. 
57 The estimated total lake and reservoir acres do not include the Great Lakes. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 6-23 
for more details on other pollutant discharges from construction sites). However, EPA’s analysis of 
benefits from reduced construction site discharges focuses on total suspended solids only. This is likely to 
result in underestimation of the expected water quality changes resulting from the C&D regulation 
because the combined impact of several pollutants on ambient water quality conditions is likely to be 
greater than a single pollutant impact. Moreover, EPA’s analysis of willingness to pay for water quality 
improvements utilizes a water quality index (WQI) to link water quality changes from reduced sediment 
runoff to effects on human uses and support for aquatic and terrestrial species habitat. As described in 
Chapter 10 of the Environmental Assessment Document, EPA estimated the WQI for a given reach using 
a weighted geometric mean function of six parameters: dissolved oxygen, BOD, nitrogen, phosphorus, 
fecal coliform, and total suspended solids. The weight assigned to TSS is 0.11, while the combined 
weight of BOD, nitrogen, and phosphorus is 0.43. Therefore, the expected change in WQI resulting from 
reduced discharges from construction sites is likely to be underestimated. Finally, the original WQI 
developed by McCleland (1974) was based on nine pollutants and included two sediment-related 
parameters: TSS and turbidity. Turbidity is excluded from the reduced version of WQI and the associated 
weight (0.08) is distributed among other parameters, which also diminishes the effect of reduced sediment 
discharges on ambient water quality conditions (as measured by WQI-6).  
6.6.2 Benefits to Navigation 
¾ The USACE dredging database identifies dredging jobs by name, which is usually the name of the water 
body dredged. However, the data lack standardized naming conventions, so it is possible that the same 
water body is dredged under different names. This may result in the exclusion of dredging job names that 
only appear once in the database, but in fact were carried out in the same water bodies as a differently 
named job, which would result in a downward bias in EPA’s dredging frequency calculations and the 
project costs. 
¾ The navigable waterway data provide latitude/longitude information for some dredging jobs, which are 
used to link dredging jobs to RF1 reaches, but these data are incomplete. In cases where latitude/longitude 
information was not available for a particular job, EPA matched it to an RF1 reach using the job name. 
This is a potential source of inaccuracy, as the job name is often the waterway name, and may not be very 
specific (in cases such as the Mississippi or Colorado rivers). It is unclear whether this would lead to an 
over- or underestimate of benefits.  
¾ The cost per cubic yard and interval data obtained from the dredging database vary significantly, even for 
different occurrences of dredging in the same water body or within regions. Aggregating such highly 
varied data and using regional averages may bias the cost and interval estimates. The direction of this bias 
is, however, uncertain. 
6.6.3 Benefits to Water Storage 
¾ There is uncertainty as to the uniformity of sediment density, as it is related to the type of soil in the area. 
Using a single density to convert volume to weight for all sediment may reduce the accuracy of the 
resulting cost estimates. However, the direction of this potential bias is uncertain. 
¾ The lack of data on reservoir dredging results in uncertainty as to the types of reservoirs that are dredged 
and the cost of this dredging.  
¾ Though sediment pools are built to accumulate sediment and preserve the useful capacity of the reservoir, 
they may also fill up more rapidly than anticipated at their initial construction, increasing the sediment 
buildup in a reservoir and increasing the cost of dredging it. It is also possible that these sediment pools 
themselves may be dredged. This analysis assumes that to maintain the current water storage capacity in 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
6-24 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
the United States, all influent sediment will have to be removed in some manner, or replaced. Building 
replacement capacity is environmentally disruptive and may be more costly than sediment removal by 
dredging, therefore this analysis assumes that dredging will be used to maintain reservoir capacity. 
6.6.4 Benefits to Drinking Water Treatment 
¾ Sediment filtration systems and pre-sedimentation (allowing water to sit and sediment to filter out before 
treatment) at drinking water treatment facilities reduce the sediment concentration of the water before it 
enters chemical treatment, so that the turbidity level of the water entering the facility is not the turbidity 
level that is eventually treated with coagulants. Assuming that the differential between pre- and post- 
compliance sediment concentration is proportional to the differential between pre- and post-compliance 
turbidity treatment introduces uncertainty, as the lower sediment levels may be more or less affected by 
the pre-sedimentation and filtration processes. EPA’s analysis attempts to account for this uncertainty by 
varying the effectiveness of pre-sedimentation basins, and thus amount of TSS and turbidity treated by a 
drinking water treatment facility. 
¾ If a drinking water treatment facility produces sludge that is toxic (due to other pollutants in the water 
besides sediment), its disposal costs may be significantly higher because toxic sludge disposal is more 
restricted and costly. If the facility cannot separate the sludge generated by sediment treatment from the 
sludge generated by treatment of toxics (which is likely the case), then all of its sludge will be 
characterized as toxic. This analysis may understate the cost of disposal (and thus the cost savings of 
smaller quantities of sludge to be disposed of) for facilities that generate toxic sludge. 
6.6.5 Willingness to Pay Estimate 
A number of issues are common to all benefit transfers. Benefit transfer involves adapting research conducted for 
another purpose in the available literature to address the policy questions at hand. Because benefits analysis of 
environmental regulations rarely affords enough time to develop original stated preference surveys that are 
specific to the policy effects, benefit transfer is often the only option to inform a policy decision. As a result, they 
are nearly universal in benefit-cost analyses (Smith et al. 2002).  
¾ Benefit transfers are by definition characterized by a difference between the context in which resource 
values are estimated and that in which benefit estimates are desired (Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). The 
ability of meta-analysis to adjust for the influence of study, economic, and resource characteristics on 
WTP can minimize, but not eliminate, potential biases (Rosenberger and Stanley 2006; Rosenberger and 
Phipps 2007; Smith et al. 2002). As is typical in applied benefit transfers, the meta-analysis model used in 
this analysis provides a close, but not perfect, match to the context in which values are desired. Some 
related and additional limitations inherent to the meta-analysis model and the subsequent benefit transfer 
include:  
¾ It is difficult to identify accurately the beneficiary (human) population and characterize how household 
values attenuate with distance from the resource. The population considered in the benefits analysis of the 
C&D regulation does not represent all the households that are likely to hold values for water resources in 
a given state. Residents of other states may hold values for water resources outside of their home state, in 
particular if such resources have regional or national significance.  
¾ The Agency notes, as detailed by Loomis (1996; Loomis et al. 2000) and Bateman et al. (2006), among 
others, that there are numerous uncertainties and associated assumptions required to aggregate WTP 
across spatial jurisdictions. While these uncertainties are well known, the literature does not agree on 
appropriate, standardized guidance for benefit aggregations, and applied benefit-cost analysis almost 
universally requires simplifying assumptions in order to generate defensible welfare aggregations. In an 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 6: Benefits Analysis 
 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 6-25 
ideal context, analysts would have information necessary to estimate spatially referenced distance decay 
relationships for all changes resulting from policies under consideration (cf. Bateman et al. 2006). 
However, the Agency notes that even the most advanced literature provides only simple illustrations of 
such issues, and none methodologically sufficient to support regulatory analysis. As a result, the 
population considered in the benefits analysis of the C&D regulation does not represent all the households 
that are likely to hold values for water resources in a given state. Residents of other states may hold 
values for water resources outside of their home state, in particular if such resources have personal, 
regional, or national significance. 
¾ Some resource valuation studies have found that respondents in the typical contingent market situation 
may overstate their WTP compared to their likely behavior in a real-world situation. However, the 
magnitude of hypothetical bias on the estimated WTP is uncertain. Following standard benefit transfer 
approaches, including meta-analytic transfers, this analysis proceeds under the assumption that each 
source study provides a valid, unbiased estimate of the welfare measure under consideration (cf. Moeltner 
et al. 2006; Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). To minimize potential hypothetical bias EPA set independent 
variable values to reflect best benefit transfer practices. 
¾ The estimation of WTP may be sensitive to differences in the environmental water quality measures. 
Studies that did not use the WQI were mapped to the WQI so a comparison could be made across studies. 
The dummy variable (WQI) captures the effect of a study using (WQI=1) or not using the WQI (WQI=0). 
It was found that studies that did not use the WQI had lower WTP values. This may indicate that there 
may have been some systematic biases in the mapping of studies that did not use the WQI. In analyzing, 
benefits of this regulation, EPA set WQI to one reduce uncertainty in WTP estimates associated with 
studies that did not include WQI as a native survey instrument. See Appendix C for a detailed discussion 
of water quality measures used in the original studies included in metadata.  
¾ Transfer error may occur when benefit estimates from a study site are adopted to forecast the benefits of a 
policy site. Rosenberger and Stanley (2006) define transfer error as the difference between the transferred 
and actual, generally unknown, value. While meta-analysis is fairly accurate when estimating benefit 
function, transfer error may be a problem in cases where the sample size is small. While meta-analyses 
have been shown to outperform other function-based transfer methods in many cases, this result is not 
universal (Shrestha et al. 2007). This notwithstanding, results reviewed by Rosenberger and Phipps 
(2007) are “very promising” for the performance of meta-analytic benefit transfers relative to alternative 
transfer methods.

7 Social Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Rule 
This chapter brings together the total social costs, discussed in Chapter 5, and total monetized benefits, discussed 
in Chapter 6, to directly compare the estimated costs and benefits of the regulatory options. All costs and 
monetized benefits are presented as annual values – representative of a typical year’s expected impact – in 2008 
dollars. 
7.1 Summary of Social Cost 
Total social costs include: 
¾ The resource costs of compliance to the private sector and to governments; 
¾ The deadweight loss to society; and, 
¾ Administrative costs to federal, state, and local governments 
The resource cost to society of each regulatory option refers to the compliance outlays required after adjusted for 
the expected C&D market contraction due to the proposed options. The proposed options may have the effect of 
reducing C&D market output because the incremental cost of compliance for each proposed option has the effect 
of increasing builders’ costs and can cause an upward shift the market’s supply curve. Part of the increased costs 
may raise the price of new housing, with the balance of increased costs being absorbed by the builder, depending 
on the relative elasticities of supply and demand. The resulting shift in market equilibrium may reduce the 
quantity of construction units produced in a given market. This quantity-adjusted measure of the resource cost of 
compliance is the primary contributor to total social cost for all three options. It encompasses the BMP and new 
technology requirements as specified by the regulatory options. 
The C&D market adjustments that arise from incurring the resource cost of compliance have a number of 
implications for the welfare of society. When the supply curve shifts as a result of incremental compliance costs, 
consumers lose some of their benefits from the product in absorbing those compliance costs. The result is a 
change in consumer surplus, part of which eventually makes its way to the entities whose services are purchased 
to implement the requirements of the rule, and part of which becomes the consumer contribution to the dead 
weight loss of the proposed rule. There is also a change in producer surplus. Some producer surplus is similarly 
transferred to other producers whose services are purchased to implement the regulation due the partial absorption 
of compliance costs, and another portion of producer surplus is contributes the dead weight loss of the rule. 
Deadweight loss to society, another component of total social cost, therefore results from losses of both consumer 
and producer surplus. 
The final component of total social cost includes the administrative costs associated with state and local 
governments’ administration of federal rule requirements to regulated entities within their jurisdictions. EPA 
assumed for the current analysis that the NPDES Phase I and Phase II stormwater permit programs are fully 
implemented and that any new regulatory requirements would be superimposed on these programs. However, EPA 
does expect a small additional administrative burden to government entities under the proposed options. Federal 
and state and local governments will incur costs for processing and analyzing discharge monitoring reports 
(DMR’s) for projects that incur cost under the proposed rule. 
As shown in Table 7-1, these three elements of cost sum to the total social cost of each regulatory option.

7.2 Summary of Monetized Benefits 
The reduction of sediment and other pollutants entering surface waters from construction sites as a result of the 
C&D regulation will have a wide range of market and nonmarket benefits, as described in Chapter 6. As noted 
previously in Chapter 6 and emphasized here, EPA’s estimate of total monetized benefits does not represent the 
full-range and magnitude of benefits expected from this rule because certain categories of benefits are not able to 
be monetized. 
Total estimated monetized benefits include: 
¾ Benefits to navigation; 
¾ Benefits to water storage; 
¾ Benefits to drinking water treatment; and, 
¾ Benefits to water quality.  
Benefits to navigation include reduced sediment settling in navigable channels, reducing the cost of dredging in 
these channels. Benefits to water storage include reduced sediment settling in reservoirs, reducing the cost of 
dredging in reservoirs that are currently dredged to recapture lost capacity. Benefits to drinking water treatment 
include reduced sediment, a reduction in the amount of chemicals needed for treatment, and a reduction in the 
amount of sludge generated from this treatment that must be disposed. Furthermore, reducing sediment levels in 
U.S. waterways has the general effect of improving water quality, as suspended sediment is one of the 
determinants of water quality. Increased water quality has both explicit and implicit value to users of water 
bodies, which was quantified using willingness-to-pay estimates based on a meta-analysis of existing WTP 
studies for water quality. The WTP estimate provides an estimate of the monetary value of recreational benefits of 
water quality improvements, including swimming, fishing, boating, and other outings. Property value increases 
stemming from water quality improvements and reduced flood risk due to decreased sediment are also implicit in 
the WTP estimate. However, all estimates of monetized benefits are subject to a degree of uncertainty resulting 
from limitations in the data EPA obtained on current dredging activity and drinking water treatment, as well as 
uncertainty inherent in WTP valuation. These uncertainties are described in detail in Chapter 6, Section 6.6. The 
estimates of monetized benefits presented in Table 7-1, below, are mid-point estimates from the ranges presented 
previously in Table 6-15. 
EPA did not include benefits to commercial fishing and shell fishing or benefits to industrial and agricultural 
water use in its monetized benefits estimate due to insufficient available data, although these benefits may be 
substantial. Sediment runoff from construction sites has been documented to reduce standing fish crops and 
shellfish populations in receiving waterbodies, which may reduce the size of commercial harvest with negative 
market implications for both firms and consumers. Industries that use surface water for cooling and hydraulic 
purposes receive benefits from lower sediment levels in water, as high levels of sediment increase wear on 
equipment. High sediment concentrations in surface water used for agricultural irrigation can harm crops by 
reducing absorption, inhibiting soil aeration, and creating dried layers of silt that may prevent seedlings form 
emerging. Reductions in the risk and frequency of these negative effects of sediment in surface water are 
considered benefits of this regulation. 
7.3 Comparison of Social Cost and Monetized Benefits 
The elements of social cost and monetized benefits and the net monetized benefits are presented in Table 7-1.  
Anticipated social costs are greater than the monetized benefits. It is important to emphasize once again that 
Chapter 6 discusses several other classes of benefits that could not be monetized but are likely to provide real 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 7: Cost & Benefits 
 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 7-3 
social benefits, and therefore, the estimate of monetized benefits is not as complete an estimate as that of total 
social cost.

8 Assessing the Impact of the C&D Regulatory Options on Small Entities – 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. et seq., Public Law 96-354), amended by the 1996 Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), requires EPA to consider the economic impact that a new rule 
will have on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to ensure that, in developing rules, agencies identify and 
consider ways to avoid undue impacts on small entities that will be affected by the regulation, whether as small 
entities that will be subject to regulatory requirements or as small governments that will be responsible for 
administering the regulation.58 While the RFA does not require an agency to minimize a rule’s impact on small 
entities if there are legal, policy, factual, or other reasons for not doing so, it does require that agencies: 
¾ Determine, to the extent feasible, the economic impact on small entities subject to the rule; 
¾ Explore regulatory options for reducing any significant economic impact on a substantial number of such 
entities; and, 
¾ Explain the ultimate choice of regulatory approach. 
For any notice-and-comment rule it promulgates, EPA must either certify that the rule “will not, if promulgated, 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities” (“SISNOSE”) or prepare a 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the Agency cannot make this certification. Small entities include small 
businesses, small organizations as defined by SBA, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
50,000. 
To evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rule on small entities, EPA conducted an RFA/SBREFA 
Screening Analysis, which includes: 
¾ Determining the number of C&D firms subject to the rule within each NAICS industry and associated 
revenue range. 
¾ Estimating the potential economic impacts on small entities based on a cost-to-revenue analysis. 
Appendix 8-1 presents a sensitivity analysis that illustrates how a typical small C&D firm could be affected by the 
regulation under alternative assumptions about the magnitude of per-acre compliance costs, the quantity of in-
scope activity performed by a small builder, and cost pass-through from the small firm to the consumer for any 
given project. 
8.1 Definition of Affected Small Entities 
The RFA defines a “small entity” as a small business (which is defined at the parent firm level, not at the 
establishment level), small not-for-profit organization, or small governmental jurisdiction. EPA expects that the 
principal impact of the C&D options on small entities will fall on small businesses that undertake C&D activities 
and small governmental units involved in permitting C&D activities. 
The RFA provides that EPA generally define small businesses according to the size standards established by 
SBA. SBA establishes criteria for identifying small businesses based on either the number of employees or annual 
revenues (13 CFR 121). These size standards vary by NAICS (North American Industrial Classification System) 
                                                     
58  Impacts on small governments are detailed in the UMRA analysis, Chapter 10 in this document.

code, and previously by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Qualifying revenue levels differ among 
NAICS industries, and within the C&D industry are as follows: 
¾ NAICS 236 (Construction of Buildings): $33.5 million 
¾ NAICS 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), except 2372: $33.5 million 
¾ NAICS 2372 (Land Subdivision of NAICS 237): $7.0 million 
8.2 Determining the Number of In-Scope Small C&D Firms 
SUSB 2002 data provide the primary basis for estimating the number of small businesses potentially subject to the 
rule. As described in the industry profile (Chapter 2), a number of adjustments and exclusions were performed to 
determine the baseline universe of firms, revenue, employees, and average firm revenue for the C&D sectors that 
EPA estimates will be affected by the proposed regulation. The analysis baseline only reflects those sectors that 
can perform activities that result in land disturbance that are NPDES permitees and those with sufficient data for 
analysis. Table 4-3 in Chapter 4, Developing the Analysis Baseline, reflects the baseline industry “snapshot” prior 
to determining the breakout of small and large firms. Based on the estimates of the number of firms by revenue 
size range within each of the relevant NAICS sectors, EPA used the small business revenue-size standards to 
estimate the number of small firms that could be within the scope of the C&D rule. The reported estimates of 
small business firms by NAICS sector are “best reasonable approximations” accounting for two considerations: 
1. As described in Chapter 4, for the firm- and industry-level analysis, EPA allocated the Land Subdivision 
sector (NAICS 23721) among the four primary building construction sectors: NAICS 236115 – New 
single-family housing construction (except operative builders); NAICS 236116 – New multifamily 
housing construction (except operative builders); NAICS 236210 – Industrial building construction; and 
NAICS 236220 – Commercial and institutional building construction. As a result, this sector, which has a 
lower small business size criterion of $7.0 million, is blended in with sectors with a higher small business 
size criterion of $31 million. For the estimation of number of small entities potentially affected by the 
regulation and the assessment of potential impacts on those entities, EPA used the $31 million cut-off for 
separating small businesses and large businesses. As a result, EPA’s implicit estimate of the number of 
small businesses in the Land Subdivision will likely overstate the actual number of small businesses in 
this sector, by including firms with revenue greater than $7.0 million in the small business count.  
2. The small business size criterion used in this analysis ($31.0 million) lies within the SUSB/Economic 
Census revenue range of $10 to $50 million. As a result, it is not possible to estimate precisely from the 
SUSB firm data the number of those firms that are small businesses, according to the SBA business size 
criterion. Including all of the relevant revenue size range in the small firm count will likely overstate the 
number of small firms while including none of the relevant revenue size range in the small firm count will 
likely understate the small firm count. If firms were distributed uniformly by revenue size within this 
revenue range, then approximately 59 percent of the firms would qualify as small business.59 However, 
based on the distribution of the reported numbers of firms by the reported revenue ranges for these 
industries – in which the larger numbers of firms lie in the lower revenue ranges – EPA expects that firms 
will not be uniformly distributed by revenue in this revenue range, and instead that firms will be 
disproportionately concentrated at the lower end of the range. Based on this expectation, for this analysis, 
EPA assumed that 75 percent of the firms in the $10 to $50 million revenue range would be small 
businesses.  
As described in Chapter 2, a very large share of total C&D industry firms and a large absolute number of firms 
are likely to be defined as small businesses and will likely undertake activities within the scope of the C&D rule. 
                                                     
59  ($33.5 million -$10 million) ÷ ($50 million - $10 million) = 0.5875.

Overall, EPA estimates that a total of 152,300 firms are in the C&D industry sectors of concern for this 
regulation. Of this total, EPA estimates that approximately 148,800 firms, or about 98 percent, are defined as 
small businesses (see Table 8-1, below).  
Although a large percentage of C&D industry businesses are defined as small business, many of these firms are 
not likely to complete projects that fall within the coverage size thresholds of the regulatory options considered in 
this analysis. EPA assessed whether small businesses would likely perform projects of sufficient size to be within 
the scope of the C&D regulation using the acreage intensity concept described in Chapter 3. EPA considers firms 
that are capable of starting annually a single project of at least one acre to be within the potential scope of a C&D 
regulation. In addition to listing total firms and small firms by sector, Table 8-1 also identified the number of 
firms by sector and size classification that EPA estimates are capable of starting annually a single project of at 
least one acre. As shown in Table 8-1, EPA estimates that a much smaller number of small businesses – 
approximately 78,200 firms – are capable of performing in-scope projects than the total of small businesses, 
approximately 148,800, in the total C&D industry. From this analysis, 70,600, or 47 percent, of the small 
businesses in the C&D industry sectors of concern are estimated not to be capable of performing in-scope 
projects.  
In assessing the potential impact of specific regulatory options on small businesses, EPA considered whether 
small firms would be capable of performing projects within the acreage size ranges for which a regulatory option 
is estimated to require compliance outlays (e.g., at least 10 acres, at least 20 acres, etc.). This assessment leads to 
further reductions in the number and percentage of small businesses that will be affected by the C&D regulation. 
Table 8-2 reports the number of small firms that are expected to incur costs under each of the regulatory options.

8.3 Estimating Economic Impacts on Small C&D Firms 
EPA assessed the impacts on small businesses by examining the ratio of estimated compliance costs to firm-level 
revenues based on model firm-based analysis of firm- and industry-level impacts. Impacts are determined by the 
number and percentage of businesses incurring costs that exceed 1 percent and 3 percent of revenue. EPA believes 
that, for the C&D industry, a SISNOSE determination should not be based primarily on the absolute number of 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 8: RFA Analysis  
8-4 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
small entities affected due to the nature of the firms that comprise this industry. This judgment is based on the 
facts that (1) this industry is comprised of a very large number of firms and (2) virtually all of these firms (98 
percent) are small firms, according to SBA size criteria. Rather than rely on the absolute number of affected small 
firms, EPA believes the percentage of impacted small entities provides a better basis for determining whether a 
given regulatory option can meet the criteria for a no-SISNOSE determination.  
The potential for impacts to small businesses was an important consideration for EPA in developing and 
analyzing regulatory options for the C&D rule. In the end, the regulatory options that EPA focused on as the 
principal candidates for proposal are all expected to exclude the majority of C&D industry small entities from 
direct regulatory requirements and incurrence of costs to comply with the rule. For all three of the options 
presented in this analysis, fewer than 15 percent of the estimated 78,168 in-scope small businesses are expected to 
incur costs, and, for Option 2, approximately 5 percent of in-scope small businesses are expected to incur 
compliance costs.   
Finally, EPA emphasizes that the proposed regulation includes no requirements – in terms either of regulatory 
coverage or of the technical requirements for compliance – that would affect small firms more adversely than 
large firms: that is, the proposed regulation does not confer a competitive advantage to large firms.  
In the firm- and industry-level analysis, compliance costs are assigned to model firms by revenue range based on 
an estimate of the quantity of acreage subject to compliance requirements that firms in a given revenue range are 
able to perform. As described in Chapter 3, the percentages of firms within each revenue range that are estimated 
to incur compliance costs exceeding one or three percent of revenue are calculated using the construction 
category-specific acreage intensity distributions previously developed and described in Chapter 4. Specifically, 
for each model firm by sector and revenue range, the calculation first determines the levels of compliance cost 
that would exceed one and three percent of revenue – these are referred to as critical compliance cost levels. The 
analysis then calculates the acreage intensity that would yield the critical compliance cost, given the relationships 
for determining compliance cost by model firm. Finally, the analysis looks to the distributions of acreage intensity 
by construction activity to estimate the percentage of firms within the revenue range for which compliance cost 
would exceed the indicated critical compliance cost values (see Chapter 3).  
The cost-to-revenue calculation is performed in two ways:  
1. Using the unadjusted compliance cost. This metric indicates the potential burden of compliance costs in 
relation to revenue, without accounting for EPA’s assessment that some of the compliance cost will be 
offset by increased revenue. 
2. Using the compliance cost adjusted by the increase in revenue that is estimated to occur from passing on a 
part of the compliance cost increase to customers as a price increase. This measure may provide a more 
meaningful measure of potential compliance cost burden. In this calculation, the total compliance cost is 
reduced by the increase in revenue resulting from cost pass-through. The resulting comparison is of net 
compliance cost burden (i.e., after the offsetting revenue increase) to baseline revenue. 
In both instances, the analysis assumes that some of the compliance cost will be passed through to consumers and 
thus offset by increased revenue. However in the first instance, the calculation of the cost-to-revenue ratio does 
not account for this effect; in the second instance, the calculation does account for the estimated revenue increase 
as an offset to compliance cost.  
Table 8-2, following page, presents the findings from the small business impact assessment for the primary 
regulatory options considered in this analysis. In addition to presenting the results from the cost-to-revenue 
analysis, Table 8-2, also presents results for two other measures of firm-level effects: (1) the number and percent 
of small firms potentially incurring “financial stress” because of compliance requirements and (2) the number and 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 8: RFA Analysis 
 
November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 8-5 
percent of small firms whose business value is expected to become negative because of the regulation (i.e., 
potential closures).  
As reported in Table 8-2, the cost to small business of the C&D options is less than the total cost of the regulatory 
options as reported in the preceding chapter. As reported in Table 5-1 (Chapter 5), total annual costs for all firms 
are approximately $132 million for Option 1, $1.9 billion for Option 2, and $3.8 billion for Option 3. In 
comparison, the total estimated costs for small businesses are less than one-third of these values: approximately 
$41 million (31 percent of the all-firms total) for Option 1, approximately $0.35 billion (18 percent of all-firms 
total) for Option 2, and $1.2 billion (32 percent of all-firms total) for Option 3.  
The impacts of these regulatory options on small businesses by regulatory option are as follows: 
¾ For Option 1, EPA estimates that approximately 2,300 small businesses will incur costs. These 2,300 
firms represent about 1.5 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 3 
percent of those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of 
a C&D regulation. EPA estimates that none of these small businesses incur costs exceeding 1 or 3 percent 
of revenue, regardless of whether the expected increased revenue offset to compliance costs is accounted 
for in the cost-to-revenue comparison. In these 2,300 firms, EPA estimates that 12 will potentially incur 
financial stress as a result of the regulatory option and 14 would potentially incur negative net business 
value – an indicator of potential closure. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may also be 
estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial impact 
may not be additive. The number of small businesses estimated to incur financial stress or potential 
closure, represent approximately 0.01 percent of the total small businesses in the C&D sectors and about 
0.02 percent of those estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. 
¾ For Option 2, EPA estimates that approximately 3,700 small businesses will incur costs. These 3,700 
firms represent about 2.5 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 5 
percent of those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of 
a C&D regulation. For this option, EPA estimates that about 395 small businesses would incur costs 
exceeding 1 percent of revenue and 17 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 3 percent of 
revenue – without accounting for the expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs. Both 
numbers represent very small percentages of the small firm universes. The 395 firms estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue represent about 0.2 percent of all small C&D sector firms and 0.5 
percent of estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. The 17 firms estimated to incur costs 
exceeding 3 percent of revenue are less than one-tenth of a percent of both small business counts. If the 
expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue calculation, 
7 small businesses are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue and none are estimated to 
incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. EPA estimates that 81 small businesses will potentially incur 
financial stress and 56 are potential closures. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may 
also be estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial 
impact may not be additive. Although these impact values are higher than the numbers for Option 1, the 
Option 2 estimates remain small percentages of the small firm counts. 
¾ Option 3 imposes a higher economic/financial burden on small businesses than Option 2, although the 
impact values, when considered as percentages of total and in-scope small businesses, remain small. For 
Option 3, EPA estimates that approximately 10,200 small businesses will incur costs. These 10,200 firms 
represent about 7 percent of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 13 percent of 
those small businesses estimated capable of performing projects potentially within the scope of a C&D 
regulation. For this option, EPA estimates that 1,868 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 1 
percent of revenue and 111 small businesses would incur costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue – again, 
without accounting for the expected cost pass-through offset to compliance costs. The 1,868 firms 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 8: RFA Analysis  
8-6 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue represent about 1 percent of all small C&D sector 
firms and 2 percent of estimated potentially in-scope small businesses. The 111 firms estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue are 0.1 percent of the small in-scope firms. If the expected cost pass-
through offset to compliance costs is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue calculation, 28 small businesses 
are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue and no small businesses are estimated to incur 
costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue. EPA estimates that 318 small businesses will potentially incur 
financial stress and 295 are potential closures. Some of the firms estimated to incur financial stress may 
also be estimated to experience negative business value, and as a result, these two measures of financial 
impact may not be additive.  
Overall, EPA estimates the small business impacts of all three of the primary options are not substantial on the 
basis of the small percentages of total small businesses and estimated small businesses that would potentially be 
adversely affected by the C&D regulatory options. Although EPA estimates that Option 2 would potentially cause 
approximately 395 firms to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue, EPA does not judge this impact to be so 
substantial or so significant as to warrant a SISNOSE finding. The number of affected firms represents a small 
percentage of all small businesses (0.2 percent) and all small in-scope businesses (0.5 percent) in the C&D 
industry sectors of concern. The estimated effects relative to the 3 percent of revenue threshold are even smaller, 
at only 17 firms. Thus, EPA does not judge the number of adversely affected small businesses to be substantial. 
Moreover, if the expected pass-through of these compliance costs is accounted for in the cost-to-revenue analysis, 
then the number of adversely affected firms falls to zero under both cost-to-revenue impact thresholds. On this 
basis, EPA further concludes that the adverse impact is not significant.

EPA Estimates 
 
8.4 Consideration of Small Entity Impacts in Regulatory Option Selection 
As described at page 8-3, above, EPA considered carefully the potential impact of the regulation on small 
businesses in developing and analyzing regulatory options. In particular, EPA set aside from consideration those 
regulatory options that would have extended regulatory coverage to project sizes that would more likely be within 
the performance capability of small businesses. The result of this effort are proposed options that EPA judges will 
have a small effect, overall, on small businesses based on any of the relevant measures of small business impact 
assessment. For example, the results for Option 2 indicate the following: 
¾ Number and percentage of small businesses estimated to incur compliance costs out of the total of small 
businesses in the C&D industry and potential in-scope small businesses:  
 Approximately 3,700 small businesses are estimated to incur costs, which represent about 2.5 percent 
of all estimated small businesses in the affected C&D sectors and 5 percent of potentially in-scope 
small businesses. 
¾ Number and percentage of small businesses estimated to incur compliance costs exceeding cost-to-
revenue impact thresholds out of the total of potential in-scope small businesses and of the total of small 
businesses estimated potentially to be within the scope of the regulation:  
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 8: RFA Analysis  
8-8 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
 395 small businesses are estimated to incur costs exceeding 1 percent of revenue, or only 0.2 percent 
of all small C&D sector firms and 0.5 percent of estimated potentially in-scope small businesses 
 17 small businesses are estimated to costs exceeding 3 percent of revenue, or less than one-tenth of a 
percent of both small business counts. 
¾ Number and percentage of small businesses estimated to incur other measures of adverse economic 
impact – financial stress and/or potential business closure – again out of the total of potential in-scope 
small businesses and of the total of small businesses estimated to incur compliance costs from the 
regulation: 
 81 small businesses are estimated to potentially incur financial stress, or fewer than 0.1 percent of 
both small C&D sector firms and estimated potentially in-scope small businesses 
 56 small businesses are assessed as potential closures, or again less than 0.1 percent of both small 
C&D sector firms and estimated potentially in-scope small businesses.

Appendix 8-1: Economic Impacts on Small Model C&D Firms Under Different In-Scope Activity 
Cases 
In the firm-level analysis, firms that are not of sufficient size (i.e., revenue) to perform an in-scope project on 
their own do not incur direct compliance cost under the regulation. However, large construction projects, in 
particular, could be completed by multiple firms who otherwise would not be able to complete an in-scope project 
on their own given the size of their business. For example, a single developer can sell “pieces” of a project to 
small independent firms. Under this configuration, the initial developer could incur the direct costs of the 
regulation but then pass those costs – in whole or in part – on to other project participants, including small 
businesses.60 We will call this the Large Developer-Small Builder configuration. The purpose of this sensitivity 
test is to examine the impact of the regulation on small firms who may incur costs under this kind of business 
configuration, and who otherwise would not be in-scope of the regulation. 
The analysis illustrates how a typical small C&D firm could be affected by the regulation by assuming that all of 
the firm’s new construction activity incurs compliance costs, and then testing cost-to-revenue impacts across a 
wide range of assumptions about revenue per acre, compliance cost per-acre, and rate of cost pass-through for 
any given project. 
This illustrative sensitivity analysis is structured as follows: 
¾ The analysis is performed for a small model C&D firm that would otherwise incur no compliance costs 
under Option 2 of the proposed C&D regulation. We have selected the model firm that represents 
Revenue Range 2 ($1M - $3M) in the New Single-Family Residential Construction (NAICS 236115) 
sector for this analysis. 
¾ For the analysis of this model firm, we estimate a 3x4 matrix of cost-to-revenue impacts. The matrix of 
impacts is defined by three “in-scope activity cases” and four acreage intensity cases. 
In-Scope Activity Cases. The three in-scope activity cases are included to establish a range of per-acre 
compliance costs that the model firm may incur depending on the kind of project in which the firm 
typically engages: 
 Assume the model firm performs in-scope activity in a 10-30 acre project (i.e. pond cost) 
 Assume the model firm performs in-scope activity in a 30+ acre project (i.e. treatment cost) 
 Assume the model firm performs in-scope activity in a mix of projects proportional to the national 
mix of projects incurring cost under Option 2 (i.e. blended pond & treatment cost) 
Acreage Intensity Cases. The four acreage intensity assumptions (e.g., acres developed per million 
dollars of revenue) are included to establish a range for the quantity of acreage, based on in-scope 
revenue, performed by the model firm under each activity case.61 For each activity case, we look at four 
acreage intensity assumptions: the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile acreage intensity values for the 
single-family construction sector.  
                                                     
60  Or, a configuration could exist where several small firms combine their resources to undertake a project, where all of the firms “share” 
the direct cost of the regulation in some way. This configuration is not addressed in the sensitivity analysis outlined here. 
61  In other words, the acreage-intensity assumptions help to account for the potentially great variability in the kind of construction 
activity that could be performed by the model firm.

¾ Before estimating the 3x4 matrix of model firm impacts, we must establish the quantity of in-scope model 
firm revenue.62 We establish the in-scope model firm revenue using two assumptions about the total 
model firm revenue: 63 
 We assume approximately 94% of the model firm’s revenue is associated with new single-family 
construction, and is therefore potentially in-scope. This assumption is based on the Census’ NAICS 
sector firm specialization data.64 
 We assume that all of the firm’s potentially in-scope revenue (e.g., 94%) is actually derived from in-
scope projects. This conservative assumption belies the reasonable expectation that, in all likelihood, 
only some of a firm’s activity will actually be performed in in-scope projects. For example, under the 
proposed Option 2, only about 51% of all new residential acreage developed is expected to incur costs 
under the regulation. 
¾ We begin to estimate the matrix of impacts by first estimating the quantity of in-scope acreage performed 
by the model firm for each acreage intensity case using the estimate of in-scope model firm revenue and 
the acreage intensity value (e.g., in-scope revenue * acres/revenue = in-scope acres). The total compliance 
cost associated with that acreage is then estimated for each in-scope activity case in the matrix using the 
per-acre compliance costs (e.g., in-scope acres * cost/acre = total cost). 
¾ We then assumed that the developer passes through 100% of the compliance cost to the small builder. 
¾ Lastly, cost-to-revenue impacts for the small model firm are estimated for each matrix option using two 
different assumptions (0% and 85%) about cost pass-through from the small builder to the consumer. 
Table 8-3 summarizes the revenue characteristics of the model C&D firm in this analysis. The table shows that 
this model firm has approximately $1.47 million of in-scope revenue; that is, revenue generated from construction 
activity that is performed on in-scope acreage and therefore incurs a compliance cost.

Percent of Revenue from New Construction 94% 
Percent of New Construction Revenue In-Scope 100% 
Model Firm Revenue/Activity Incurring Cost $1,467,810 
Source: EPA Analysis 
 
Table 8-4 presents the results of this analysis for Option 2. Cost-to-revenue impacts on the small C&D firm 
increase as you move down the acreage intensity cases in any column, or as you move across the in-scope activity 
cases for any acreage intensity case. The greatest impact on the small model firm is therefore observed for the 30+ 
acre in-scope activity case (column 3) and the 90th percentile acreage intensity case. For the highest impact case, 
costs absorbed by the model firm represent 0.22% – 1.45% of firm revenues, depending on the cost pass-through 
assumption. One could reasonably expect impacts to be even less if one relaxes the conservative assumption that 
all of the firms new construction activity occurs in in-scope projects. The results for potential compliance costs 
incurred under Options 1 and 3 are presented in Table 8-5. 
                                                     
62  In-scope model firm revenue, when combined with acreage intensity, determines the quantity of model firm acreage that incurs costs. 
That quantity of acreage is then assigned costs based on the in-scope activity case 
63  Although model firm compliance cost is determined by in-scope revenue, the cost-to-revenue results are still based on total firm 
revenue. 
64  It would be preferable to have this information by revenue range, however is not readily available from the Census.

9 Assessing the C&D Regulatory Options in Accordance with Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) Requirements  
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), P.L. 104-4, requires federal agencies to assess 
the effects of their regulatory actions on state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. Under section 
202 of UMRA, EPA generally prepares a written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for proposed and 
final rules with “federal mandates” that may result in expenditures by state, local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. 
Before EPA promulgates a rule for which a written statement is needed, section 205 of UMRA directs EPA to 
consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt the least costly, most cost-effective or least 
burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule. The provisions of section 205 do not apply when 
they are inconsistent with applicable law. Moreover, section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the 
least costly, most cost-effective or least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes with the proposed 
rule an explanation of why that alternative was not adopted. 
In addition, before EPA establishes any regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments, including tribal governments, the Agency is to develop a small government agency plan pursuant to 
section 203 of UMRA. The purpose of the plan is to provide for notifying potentially affected small governments, 
thus enabling officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely input in the development of 
EPA regulatory proposals with significant federal mandates, and informing, educating, and advising small 
governments on compliance with the regulatory requirements. 
Lastly, UMRA requires the statutory authority for the rule to be cited. A detailed discussion of the objectives and 
legal basis for the proposed rule will be presented in the Federal Register preamble a proposed regulation. 
In accordance with these UMRA requirements, EPA evaluated the impact of the C&D regulatory options on (1) 
government entities, (2) small governments, and (3) private entities.  
9.1 Assessing Costs to Government Entities 
The purpose of this part of the UMRA analysis is to estimate the potential regulatory burden of the C&D 
regulatory options on State, Local, and Tribal governments. For this assessment, EPA considered two concepts of 
potential government burden: 
¾ Administrative Costs. Administrative costs are those costs associated with state and local governments’ 
administration of federal rule requirements to regulated entities within their jurisdictions.  
¾ Compliance Costs. Governments build or hire contractors to perform construction and development 
activities on a material quantity of developed space in any given year. These government projects will 
need to comply with the proposed rule just as private sector projects will, and therefore, governments are 
assumed to incur some incremental compliance costs.   
The total of the administrative costs for permitting and related activities and the compliance costs estimated to apply 
to government are the total costs to government. 
The following sections discuss EPA’s proposed methodology for assessing these costs to governments. 
Economic Analysis of Construction & Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 9: UMRA 
9-2 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute November 14, 2008 
9.1.1.1 Administrative Costs 
EPA assumed for the current analysis that the NPDES Phase I and Phase II stormwater permit programs are fully 
implemented and that any new regulatory requirements would be superimposed on these programs. However, EPA 
expects a small additional administrative burden to government entities under the proposed options. Federal and 
state and local governments will incur costs for processing and analyzing discharge monitoring reports (DMR’s) 
for projects that incur cost under the proposed rule. EPA has estimated preliminary results of the additional 
administrative cost to governments for administering the DMR’s.65 
The cost to federal and state and local governments for processing and analyzing DMR’s is a function of (1) the 
number of DMR’s received by the permitting authority, (2) the labor hour requirement to process and analyze the 
DMR, and (3) the labor rate and associated overhead costs of the federal and state and local employees who 
process DMR’s. EPA assumed that one DMR will be required for each project that incurs cost under Option 2 and 
Option 3. EPA engineering analysis estimates 60,411 projects under Option 2 and 119,356 projects under Option 
3 will require the submittal of a DMR. Furthermore, depending on the project location, the DMR will either be 
received by the federal or the state or local authority.66 The breakout of projects into the federal and the state and 
local DMR jurisdiction is determined from the option specific turbidity requirement acreage by state. For both 
Option 2 and Option 3, the percent of total acreage subject to the turbidity monitoring requirement is determined 
for the five states that will file their DMR’s to the federal authority. This percentage is applied to the total number 
of projects to determine the number of projects covered by the federal and the state and local DMR jurisdictions. 
The labor hour requirement for the processing and review of the DMR is from the Information Collection Request 
(ICR) for National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Sewage Sludge Monitoring Reports. 
The ICR estimates that an average of 10 minutes (0.17 hrs) is required to review and process the DMR. 
Furthermore, 20 percent of the DMR’s submitted will require some form of follow-up action due to non-
compliance. The follow-up action requires an average of 30 minutes (0.5 hrs) per DMR (U.S. EPA, 2005). 
Therefore, EPA has assumed that 80 percent of projects will require 0.17 labor hours whereas the other 20 percent 
will require 0.67 labor hours. 
Labor rates for federal government employees are based on the Base General Schedule Pay Scale from a federal 
employment website. The GS-12, Step 5 estimated hourly rate, including a 1.6 multiplier accounting for overhead 
and fringe benefits67, is $50.31 in 2008 dollars (FedJobs, 2008). Labor rates for state and local government 
employees are based on the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics Employer Costs for Employee 
Compensation. The state and local employer cost-per-hour for employee compensation (including benefits) is 
$37.73 in December 2007 dollars (U.S. DOL, 2007). 
Table 9-1 details the calculation of the government administrative costs. Total costs are provided for both the 
federal and state and local governments.  
 
                                                     
65  Processing and reviewing DMR’s is only required under Option 2 and Option 3. Option 1 does not have any turbidity monitoring 
requirements. 
66  Alaska, District of Columbia, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico do not have approved NPDES programs. 
Therefore, the administrative cost for their project DMR’s is attributed to the federal government. 
67  The 1.6 overhead and fringe benefits multiplier is assumed according to the EPA ICR Handbook.

9.1.1.2 Compliance Costs 
Governments will likely bear some of the compliance costs associated with the regulatory options, assuming that 
these costs are passed on from developers and builders. EPA estimated the compliance costs potentially incurred 
by government entities, based on the value of construction work done by government agencies (federal, state, and 
local) as a percentage of the total value of construction, as reported in the U.S. Census publication, Construction 
Spending for 2002. Table 9-2 shows, for each regulatory option, total compliance costs by general construction 
activity category, and broken between the private sector and various public sectors. Table 9-3 provides the same 
breakout of total acreage incurring costs.

9.2 Assessing Costs and Impacts on Small Government Entities 
In addition to looking at total outlays by governments for the C&D regulatory options, in accordance with UMRA 
requirements, EPA also considered the extent to which these outlays would fall specifically on small 
governmental entities, and the potential impact of these entities. The assessment of impacts on small 
governmental entities involved two steps: (1) identifying small government entities (i.e., those serving 
populations of less than 50,000, (5 USC 601[5])), (2) estimating the share of total government costs for the 
regulatory options incurred by small governments, and (3) estimating the potential impact from these costs based 
on comparison of small government outlays with small government revenue and outlays.  
The smallest unit of government potentially affected by the rule is at the sub-county (i.e., municipal or township) 
government level. The evaluation of potential impact on these entities began by estimating the share of local-
government compliance and administrative costs (as described in previous section) incurred by small 
governments, as follows: 
¾ EPA identified the sub-set of local-government entities determined to be small government entities. The 
determination is based on a national estimate – from the U.S. Census – of the population served by local 
jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000 population (i.e., of the total population in local jurisdictions, the 
percentage of that population in local jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000 people); 
¾ Based on the proportion of population served by small governments out of total population in local 
jurisdictions, EPA allocated local-government compliance and administrative costs to the sub-set of local-
government entities determined to be small. This allocation assumes that government construction 
activity and incurrence of compliance and administrative costs are proportional to population;68 
¾ EPA compared the local government share of compliance and administrative costs against several 
baseline indicators to assess the extent of potential impacts on small governmental entities. The indicators 
                                                     
68  Approximately 92 percent of the total U.S. population in 2002 lived in areas governed by a municipality or town/township. Of those 
served by these sub-county governments, approximately 51 percent lived in areas served by municipal or town/township governments 
with populations of less than 50,000. Therefore, EPA estimated that 51 percent of local government compliance costs affect projects 
undertaken by small government entities.

include total government revenue, capital outlay, and capital outlay for construction only. The comparisons 
indicate the materiality of the compliance and administrative outlays in relation to the baseline government 
revenue and outlay levels. 
Table 9-6 reports total compliance and administrative costs estimated to be incurred by small government entities 
and the findings from comparing these outlays with the three baseline measures.

9.3 Assessing Costs and Impacts on Private Entities 
The potential economic impacts for private entities that were analyzed were divided into two major groups: 
¾ Impacts on the individual projects, establishments, and firms in the construction industries, and  
¾ Impacts at the national level and on the national economy. 
EPA’s analysis of impacts on private entities was previously detailed in Chapter 3: Economic Impact Analysis 
Methodology and results were reported in Chapter 5: Economic Impact Analysis Results.
