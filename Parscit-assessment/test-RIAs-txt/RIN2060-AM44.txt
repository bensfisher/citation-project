SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing national emission 
standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for new and existing industrial, commercial, 
and institutional boilers and process heaters.1 The proposed rule would require all major sources 
to meet hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions standards reflecting the application of the 
maximum achievable control technology (MACT). Under a separate action, EPA is also 
proposing a NESHAP for two area source categories: industrial boilers and institutional and 
commercial boilers.2 The proposed emission standards for controlling mercury and polycyclic 
organic matter (POM) emissions are based on the MACT. The proposed emission standards for 
controlling other HAPs are based on EPA’s proposed determination as to what constitutes the 
generally available control technology (GACT) or management practices. As part of the 
regulatory process, EPA is required to develop a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). The RIA 
includes an economic impact analysis (EIA) and a small entity impacts analysis and documents 
the RIA methods and results. 
1.1 Executive Summary 
The key results of the RIA are as follows: 
 Engineering Cost Analysis: EPA estimates the proposed major source NESHAP’s 
total annualized costs will be $2.9 billion (2008$). For the area source NESHAP, 
EPA estimates the total annualized costs will be $0.5 billion. 
 Market Analysis: Under the proposed major source NESHAP, the Agency’s 
economic model suggests the average national prices for industrial sectors could be 
0.01% higher with the NESHAP, while average annual domestic production may fall 
by about 0.01%. Because of higher domestic prices, imports rise by 0.01% per year. 
Market-level effects for the proposed area source NESHAP are smaller when 
compared to the proposed major source rule; average price, production, and import 
changes are less than 0.01%. 
 Social Cost Analysis: The estimated social cost of the proposed major source rule is 
just under $2.9 billion (2008$). In the near term, the Agency’s economic model 
suggests that industries are able to pass approximately $0.8 billion of the rule’s costs 
to consumers (e.g., higher market prices). Domestic industries’ surplus falls by $2.5 
billion, while other countries on net benefit from higher prices (a net increase in rest-
of-the world [ROW] surplus of $0.1 billion). Additional costs and fuel savings for 
                                                 
1 On June 19, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit) vacated the 
NESHAP for industrial/commercial/institutional boilers and process heaters. This action provides EPA’s 
proposed rule in response to the court’s vacatur. 
2 Gas-fired boilers are not part of the area source categories of industrial boilers and institutional/commercial boilers. 
 1-2 
new and existing major sources that are not included in the economic model represent 
a net benefit of $0.4 billion. The estimated social cost of the proposed area source 
rule is approximately $0.5 billion (2008$). In the near term, the Agency’s economic 
model suggests that industries are able to pass approximately $0.3 billion of the rule’s 
costs to consumers. Domestic industries’ surplus falls by $0.3 billion and the net 
increase in ROW surplus is less than $0.1 billion. Additional costs and fuel savings 
for unknown, existing, and new area sources not included in the economic model 
results represent a net benefit of $0.1 billion. 
 Employment Changes: Near-term employment changes associated with the 
proposed major source rule are estimated to be less than 8,000 job losses; over a 
longer time period, net employment effects range between 6,000 job losses to 12,000 
job gains. For the area source rule, near-term employment changes associated with 
the proposed major source rule are estimated to be less than 1,000 job losses; over a 
longer time period, net employment effects also range between 1,000 job losses to 
3,000 job gains. 
 Small Entity Analyses: EPA performed a screening analysis for impacts on small 
entities by comparing compliance costs to sales/revenues (e.g., sales and revenue 
tests). EPA’s analysis found the tests were typically higher than 3% for small entities 
included in the screening analysis. EPA has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis (IRFA) that discusses alternative regulatory or policy options that minimize 
the rule’s small entity impacts. It includes key information about key results from the 
Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel. 
 Benefits Analysis: In the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates the 
PM2.5 co-benefits of the proposed major source rule are $17 billion to $41 billion and 
$15 billion to $37 billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates respectively. In the year of full 
implementation (2013), EPA estimates the PM2.5 co-benefits of this proposed area 
source rule are $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion and $910 million to $2.2 billion, at 3% and 
7% discount rates respectively. All estimates are in 2008 dollars. Using alternate 
relationships between PM2.5 and premature mortality supplied by experts, higher and 
lower co-benefits estimates are plausible, but most of the expert-based estimates fall 
between these estimates. The benefits from reducing other air pollutants have not 
been monetized in this analysis, including reducing 370,000 tons of carbon monoxide, 
37,000 tons of HCl, and 1,000 tons of HF, 8.3 tons of mercury, 3,400 tons of other 
metals, and 1,200 grams of dioxins/furans each year from major and area sources. In 
addition, ecosystem benefits and visibility benefits have not been monetized in this 
analysis. 
 Net Benefits: The net benefits for the proposed major source rule only are $14 billion 
to $38 billion and $12 billion to $34 billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates, 
respectively in 2013. The net benefits for the area source rule only are $500 million to 
$1.9 billion and $410 million to $1.7 billion in 2013, at 3% and 7% discount rates, 
respectively. All estimates are in 2008 dollars.

SECTION 2 
INDUSTRY PROFILES 
In this section, we provide an introduction selected industries that are affected by the 
proposed rules. The industries were selected based on high facility population counts within 3-
digit NAICs industries reported in the combustion facility survey. The purpose is to give the 
reader a general understanding of economic aspects and industry trends to provide additional 
context for the economic impact analysis. 
2.1 Food Manufacturing 
2.1.1 Introduction 
Food manufacturing involves the transformation of raw agricultural and livestock 
products into processed food. Between 1997 and 2002, shipment values stagnated, falling 0.38%, 
while the number of employees and payroll increased 2.71% and 7.76%, respectively 
(Table 2-1). This trend reversed between 2002 and 2006, as shipment values rose 4.77 % and 
number of employees and payroll fell 5.94% and 3.28% respectively (Table 2-1). Shipments, 
payroll, and employment continued to increase between 2006 and 2007, but there was a notable 
drop in the number of establishments between 2002 and 2007 (Table 2-1). As Table 2-2 shows, 
payroll per employee grew 4.91% from 1997 to 2002 and continued to increase, albeit at a 
slower rate of 2.83%, from 2002 to 2006. Between 2006 and 2007, the payroll per employee 
declined as the growth in employees outpaced the increase in the annual payroll (Table 2-2). 
The food manufacturing industry consists of nine different industry groups, each 
distinguished by the livestock or agricultural products used as raw materials for the processed 
food products as follows: 
 Animal Food Manufacturing (North American Industry Classification System 
[NAICS] 3111) 
 Grain and Oilseed Milling (NAICS 3112) 
 Sugar and Confectionery Product Manufacturing (NAICS 3113) 
 Fruit and Vegetable Preserving and Specialty Food Manufacturing (NAICS 3114) 
 Dairy Product Manufacturing (NAICS 3115) 
 Animal Slaughtering and Processing (NAICS 3116) 
 Seafood Product Preparation and Packaging (3117) 
 Bakeries and Tortilla Manufacturing (NAICS 3118)

Many major environmental regulations directly affect the food manufacturing industry 
and/or other markets that provide key goods and services to the industry (e.g., energy). RTI’s 
multimarket model is specifically designed to analyze these types of regulations. The model 
emphasizes the links among industrial sectors and provides policy makers with new insights 
about the direct and indirect effects of a regulatory program and the distribution of costs across 
the U.S. economy. 
2.1.2 Supply and Demand Characteristics 
Next, we provide a broad overview of the supply and demand sides of the food 
manufacturing industry. We emphasize the economic interactions this industry has with other 
industries and people, including identifying the key goods and services used by the industry and 
the major uses and consumers of food manufacturing products. 
2.1.2.1 Goods and Services Used in Food Manufacturing 
In 2006, the cost of materials made up 57% of the value of shipments in food production. 
Total employee compensation accounted for 12% of this value, with half of that coming from 
production workers’ wages (Table 2-3). 
The top 10 industry groups supplying inputs to food production accounted for 84% of the 
total intermediate inputs to the industry, with the top three industry groups (food products, 
animal products, and crop products) accounting for over half of the total intermediate inputs 
(Table 2-4). Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution accounted for 2% of the 
total intermediate inputs, whereas boilers, tanks, and shipping containers accounted for 1%. 
2.1.2.2 Energy 
The Department of Energy (DOE) classifies the entire food products industry as an 
energy-intensive industry to model within its Industrial Demand Module (DOE, 2008a). In 2002, 
food manufacturing accounted for 6.86% of the total fuel consumption by all manufacturing 
industries (NAICS 311–339) and 19.24% of the conventional boiler use fuel consumption by all 
manufacturing industries (DOE, Energy Information Administration, 2007).

In both 2005 and 2006, purchased electricity and fuel each accounted for 1% of the total 
value of shipments in food manufacturing (Table 2-3). In 2002, total energy consumption totaled 
1,116 TBTU, a 7% increase over 1998 (Table 2-5). Of this total fuel consumption, the largest 
share (41.72%) was consumed for indirect uses including conventional boiler use and combined 
heat and power (CHP) and/or cogeneration process (MECS Table 5.2). Between 1997 and 2005, 
while the manufacturing sector as a whole used less electricity, food manufacturing used more 
electricity (Figure 2-3). From 2005to 2006, the electricity consumption increased by nearly 9% 
(Table 2-5).

a Net electricity is obtained by summing purchases, transfers in, and generation from noncombustible renewable 
resources, minus quantities sold and transferred out. It does not include electricity inputs from on-site 
cogeneration or generation from combustible fuels because that energy has already been included as generating 
fuel (for example, coal). 
b Distillate fuel oil includes Nos. 1, 2, and 4 fuel oils and Nos. 1, 2, and 4 diesel fuels. 
c Natural gas includes natural gas obtained from utilities, local distribution companies, and any other supplier(s), 
such as independent gas producers, gas brokers, marketers, and any marketing subsidiaries of utilities. 
d Examples of liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) are ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, normal butane, butylene, 
ethane-propane mixtures, propane-butane mixtures, and isobutene produced at refineries or natural gas processing 
plants, including plants that fractionate raw natural gas liquids (NGLs). 
e Other includes net steam (the sum of purchases, generation from renewables, and net transfers), and other energy 
that respondents indicated was used to produce heat and power.

2.1.2.3 Uses and Consumers 
The majority of food manufacturing’s total commodity output (58%) is sold for personal 
consumption. Of the sales for intermediate use, 42% are sold back into the food manufacturing 
industry (Table 2-6). 
2.1.3 Firm and Market Characteristics 
This remaining subsection describes geographic, production, and market data. These data 
provide the basis for further analysis, including regulatory flexibility analyses, and give a 
complete picture of the recent historical trends of production and pricing. 
2.1.3.1 Location 
In 2002, California had the most food manufacturing establishments in the United States, 
followed by New York and Texas (see Figure 2-4). In addition, Pennsylvania, Illinois, 
Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Florida had over 1,000 establishments in their states.

2.1.3.2 Production Capacity and Utilization 
Capacity utilization of the food manufacturing industry did not fall off during the 
recession of 2001 as much as the manufacturing sector as a whole (Figure 2-5). Food 
manufacturing’s capacity utilization has remained higher than manufacturing as a whole and 
went above 85% in the spring of 2008. The effects of the recent economic downturn have not 
affected capacity utilization as sharply in the food industry relative to the overall manufacturing 
sector (Figure 2-5).

<http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/>. 
2.1.3.3 Employment 
The geographic distribution of employment in food manufacturing varies substantially 
from the distribution of establishments. In 2002, Arkansas, ranked thirty-first in number of 
establishments and had the eighth most employees (53,844) because of its national high of 199 
employees per establishment. New York, ranked second in number of establishments, had only 
the tenth most employees (50,012). North Carolina and Georgia also had greater than 50,000 
employees, despite having fewer than 600 establishments (Figure 2-6).

2.1.3.4 Plants and Capacity 
Production capacity in food manufacturing only grew 17.94% between 1997 and early 
2008, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.45%. This is substantially less than the 
42.50% growth for the manufacturing industry as a whole (Figure 2-7). 
2.1.3.5 Firm Characteristics 
In fiscal year 2007, the top eight food manufacturing companies each had greater than 
$10 billion in sales. These companies, however, are global, many with a large portion of both 
sales and production coming from operations outside of the United States (Table 2-7). The 
largest U.S. food manufacturing company, Kraft Foods Inc., has 50.27% of its long-lived assets 
located outside of the United States (Kraft Foods Inc., 2008).

Manufacturing Food
 2-12 
For the industry as a whole, the number of corporations as well as the number of 
corporations with net income in the food manufacturing industry grew between 2004 and 2005. 
Although the overall number of companies continued to grow in 2006, the number of those with 
a positive net income declined along with profit margins and total receipts (Table 2-8).

2.1.3.6 Size Distribution 
The primary criterion for categorizing a business as small is number of employees, using 
definitions by the SBA for regulatory flexibility analyses. The data describing size standards are 
provided in Table 2-9. Over 80% of the NAICS industries within the food manufacturing 
industry use a cutoff of 500 employees. In 2002, enterprises with fewer than 500 employees 
accounted for 32% of employment and 23% of receipts within food manufacturing (Table 2-10). 
2.1.3.7 Domestic Production 
Between 1997 and early 2008, overall manufacturing production grew faster (34.88%) 
than the food manufacturing component (26.18%) (Figure 2-8). The food manufacturing industry 
has been less volatile, particularly during the recession of 2001 and the current economic 
downturn. 
2.1.3.8 International Trade 
In 2006, the United States regained a trade surplus in food manufacturing it had briefly 
lost during 2004 to 2005 (see Figure 2-9). The trade surplus in 2007 was over $4 billion. Both 
exports and imports have declined since their 2008 peak as a result of the global economic 
recession.

2.1.3.9 Market Prices 
Prices of goods in food manufacturing have moved generally in line with prices in overall 
manufacturing (see Figure 2-10). Both indexes increased over 31% since between early 2003 and 
early 2008, a CAGR of 5.13%. This rise was followed by a marked decline in recent years along 
with the downward trend in prices throughout the economy.

2.2 Wood Product Manufacturing 
2.2.1 Introduction 
According to a report by Standard & Poor’s (2008), a number of factors are shaping the 
current economic environment for wood products, including, but not limited to, the housing 
slump, high input costs, low prices for lumber and other building materials, and a weak dollar. 
Table 2-11 shows that revenues in this industry are not entirely predictable, exhibiting a drop in 
shipment revenue between 1997 and 2002 but a rise back to within $5 billion of the 1997 value 
in 2006 and a decline to within $14 billion of the 2006 value in 2007.

The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes this industry’s facilities into three categories: 
“sawmills and wood preservation;” “veneer, plywood, and engineered wood product 
manufacturing;” and “other wood product manufacturing.” These are further divided into the 
following types of facilities as defined by the Census Bureau: 
 Sawmills and Wood Preservation 
– Sawmills and Wood Preservation (NAICS 32111): This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following manufacturing 
activities: (a) sawing dimension lumber, boards, beams, timber, poles, ties, 
shingles, shakes, siding, and wood chips from logs or bolts; (b) sawing round 
wood poles, pilings, and posts and treating them with preservatives; and 
(c) treating wood sawed, planed, or shaped in other establishments with creosote 
or other preservatives to prevent decay and to protect against fire and insects. 
Sawmills may plane the rough lumber that they make with a planing machine to 
achieve smoothness and uniformity of size. 
 Veneer, Plywood, and Engineered Wood Product Manufacturing 
– Veneer, Plywood, and Engineered Wood Product Manufacturing (NAICS 32121): 
This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the 
following manufacturing activities: (a) veneer and/or plywood, (b) engineered 
wood members, and (c) reconstituted wood products. This industry includes 
manufacturing plywood from veneer made in the same establishment or from 
veneer made in other establishments, and manufacturing plywood faced with non-
wood materials, such as plastics or metal. 
 Other Wood Product Manufacturing 
– Millwork (NAICS 32191): This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing hardwood and softwood cut stock and dimension stock 
(i.e., shapes); wood windows and wood doors; and other millwork including wood 
flooring. Dimension stock or cut stock is defined as lumber and worked wood 
products cut or shaped to specialized sizes. These establishments generally use 
woodworking machinery, such as jointers, planers, lathes, and routers to shape 
wood. 
– Wood Container and Pallet Manufacturing (NAICS 32192): This industry 
comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wood pallets, wood 
box shook, wood boxes, other wood containers, and wood parts for pallets and 
containers. 
– All Other Wood Product Manufacturing (NAICS 32199): This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wood products (except 
establishments operating sawmills and wood preservation facilities; and 
establishments manufacturing veneer, plywood, engineered wood products, 
millwork, wood containers, or pallets). 
 2-19 
Figure 2-11 shows that the industry proportion of the value of shipments for other wood 
product manufacturing (51%) was greater than the value of shipments for sawmills and wood 
preservation (27%) and veneer, plywood, and engineered wood products (22%). Figure 2-12 
indicates that the majority of employees in this industry fell under other wood products (60%). 
Veneer, plywood, and engineered wood products had the same percentage (20%) of employees 
as sawmills and wood preservation (20%), even though it contributed to a lesser portion of the 
value of shipments. 
2.2.2 Supply and Demand Characteristics 
Next, we provide a broad overview of the supply and demand sides of the wood product 
manufacturing industry. We emphasize the economic interactions this industry has with other 
industries and people and identify the key goods and services used by the industry and the major 
uses and consumers wood products.

2.2.2.1 Goods and Services Used in Wood Product Manufacturing 
In 2007, the cost of materials made up 59% of the total shipment value of goods in the 
wood product manufacturing industry (Table 2-13). Total compensation of employees 
represented 22% of the total value in 2007. Both the number of total shipments and the number 
of employees in this industry decreased between 2005 and 2007—the former by 14% and the 
latter by 3%. 
The top 10 industry groups supplying inputs to the wood product industry accounted for 
80% of the total intermediate inputs according to 2008 Bureau of Economic Analysis data 
(Table 2-14). The largest comes from the wood product industry itself. This is quite 
understandable, since the descriptions of the various industries within wood product 
manufacturing imply that they supply each other with products in order to add value and 
distribute their products to the broader market. The top five inputs are rounded out by forestry 
and logging products, wholesale trade, management of companies and enterprises, and truck 
transportation, which together make up 70% of the total cost of input.

2.2.2.1.1 Energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) categorizes wood product 
manufacturing (NAICS 321) as a non-energy-intensive industry. The 2008 Annual Energy 
Outlook predicts that the wood product industry will be one of five (out of eight) non-energy-
intensive industries experiencing positive average growth of delivered energy consumption 
between 2006 and 2030 (DOE, 2008).

2.2.2.2 Uses and Consumers 
Table 2-16 shows that three of the top four consumers of wood products are represented 
by the construction sector of the economy (NAICS 23). New residential construction, new 
nonresidential construction, and maintenance and repair construction consume 35% of the total 
commodity output in this industry. The top 10 consumers of wood products make up 54% of the 
demand for wood products. Although many of the top consumers deal with construction, repair, 
or real estate services, other types of consumers, such as food services and drinking places, rail 
transportation, plastics and rubber products manufacturing, and other, use these products.

This section describes geographic, production, and market data. These data provide the 
basis for further analysis, including regulatory flexibility analyses, as well as a complete picture 
of the recent historical trends of production and pricing. 
2.2.3.1 Location 
As Figure 2-14 illustrates, the states with the largest number of wood product 
manufacturing establishments are dispersed throughout the country, with a significant 
concentration of establishments in the northeastern states. Other states with many establishments 
include California, Texas, and North Carolina.

2.2.3.2 Production Capacity and Utilization 
Capacity utilization of the wood product manufacturing industry has been experiencing 
capacity utilization increases and declines with more extreme fluctuations than those of all 
manufacturing industries combined. The decline in wood product manufacturing is similar to 
total manufacturing between 1997 and 2002. However, capacity utilization in total 
manufacturing, which peaked in 2006, started increasing at a faster rate than wood product 
manufacturing, but decreased sharply after its peak. Wood product manufacturing experienced 
its own rapid decrease in capacity utilization between 2007 and 2009, though not at the same rate 
as total manufacturing (Figure 2-15).

Manufacturing: Geographic Area Series: Industry Statistics for the States, Metropolitan and Micropolitan 
Statistical Areas, Counties, and Places: 2002.” <http://factfinder.census.gov>; (July 23, 2008). 
2.2.3.3 Employment 
California has the largest number of employees in the wood product manufacturing 
industry with over 39,000 reported in the 2002 census followed by over 32,000 in Oregon 
(Figure 2-17). The states with the highest number of employees do not directly correlate with the 
states with the highest number of establishments. States such as Indiana, Georgia, Arkansas, and 
Oregon had fewer than 600 establishments, as shown in Figure 2-14, but had more than 20,000 
employees, whereas states such as Ohio and New York had fewer than 20,000 employees but 
more than 600 establishments. 
2.2.3.4 Plants and Capacity 
While the capacity of the manufacturing sector has been growing consistently since 1997, 
the wood product manufacturing industry has experienced inconsistent growth. After a small 
amount of growth in capacity between 1997 and 2001, the wood product manufacturing 
industry’s capacity dipped between 2002 and 2005 but has been growing at a slow rate since then 
though it started to dip again in 2008 and 2009 (Figure 2-17).

2.2.3.5 Firm Characteristics 
In 2006, the top 10 paper and forest product companies produced over $75 billion in 
sales, with the top two companies—International Paper and Weyerhaeuser—generating nearly 
$22 billion each (Table 2-17. The top two companies’ revenue consists of 58% of the revenue of 
the top 10 companies in Standard & Poor’s (S&P’s) list (Benwart, 2006). Although these 
numbers do not exclusively reflect wood products, they do convey the market environment in 
which firms in this sector compete. 
2.2.3.6 Size Distribution 
The primary criterion for categorizing a business as small is the number of employees, 
using definitions by the SBA for regulatory flexibility analyses. According to SUSB reports for 
2002, small companies were the recipients of the majority of receipts in 2002; 53% of receipts 
were generated by companies with fewer than 500 employees (Table 2-18). The number of 
employees in the small business cutoff is 500 employees for all subindustries in the wood 
product manufacturing industry (Table 2-19).

2.2.3.7 Domestic Production 
Similar to industry capacity rates, industry production rates for wood product 
manufacturing have decreased since 2006 compared to the steady increase in production for the 
manufacturing sector since 1997 (Figure 2-18). Similar to capacity utilization trends 
(Figure 2-16), the index shows a faster rate of decline for wood products than the entire 
manufacturing sector. 
2.2.3.8 International Trade 
Since 1997, the wood product manufacturing industry has contributed to an increasing 
trade deficit (Figure 2-16). The value of imports has fluctuated greatly since 1997; however, 
exports have remained fairly constant, with seasonal changes, since 1997.

2.2.3.9 Market Prices 
Prices of goods in the wood product manufacturing industry have remained roughly the 
same since 2005. The prices for the entire manufacturing sector increased between 2003 and 
2008 but have decreased since August 2008. Producer price indices (PPIs) show that producer 
prices for wood products increased by 6% from 2004 to 2007 (Figure 2-20).

2.3 Paper Manufacturing 
2.3.1 Introduction 
The paper manufacturing subsector is an essential component of all business operations 
worldwide. Broadly speaking, paper and paperboard are manufactured by converting timber or 
other recycled material into products such as printing and writing papers, newsprint, tissue, and 
containerboard (Benwart, 2006). The subsector has been experiencing a decline in shipments as 
of late. From 1997 to 2007, shipments in the industry declined 7%, and employment declined by 
27% (Table 2-21). While total payroll dropped 26% over this time, annual payroll per employee 
rose 2% from 1997 to 2007 because of the decline in the number of employees (Table 2-20). 
Shipments per employee grew 28% from 1997 to 2007, with much of that growth taking place 
between 2002 and 2006 (Table 2-21).

The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes this industry’s facilities into two categories: pulp, 
paper, and paperboard manufacturing and converted paper product manufacturing. These are 
further divided into the following types of facilities as defined by the Census Bureau (2001): 
 Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard: 
– Pulp Mills (NAICS 32211): This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing pulp without manufacturing paper or paperboard. The 
pulp is made by separating the cellulose fibers from the other impurities in wood 
or other materials, such as used or recycled rags, linters, scrap paper, and straw. 
– Paper Mills (NAICS 32212): This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing paper from pulp. These establishments may 
manufacture or purchase pulp. In addition, the establishments may convert the 
paper they make. The activity of making paper classifies an establishment into 
this industry regardless of the output. 
– Paperboard Mills (NAICS 32213): This industry comprises establishments 
primarily engaged in manufacturing paperboard from pulp. These establishments 
may manufacture or purchase pulp. In addition, the establishments may also 
convert the paperboard they make. 
 Converted Paper Products: 
– Paperboard Containers Manufacturing (NAICS 32221): This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in converting paperboard into containers 
without manufacturing paperboard. These establishments use corrugating, cutting, 
and shaping machinery to form paperboard into containers. Products made by 
these establishments include boxes; corrugated sheets, pads, and pallets; paper 
dishes; and fiber drums and reels. 
– Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing (NAICS 32222): This 
industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the 
following manufacturing activities: cutting and coating paper and paperboard; 
cutting and laminating paper and paperboard and other flexible materials (except 
plastics film to plastics film); bags or multiwall bags or sacks of paper, metal foil, 
coated paper, or laminates or coated combinations of paper and foil with plastics 
film; laminated aluminum and other converted metal foils from purchased foils; 
and surface coating paper or paperboard. 
– Stationary Product Manufacturing (NAICS 32223): This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in converting paper or paperboard into products 
used for writing, filing, art work, and similar applications. 
– Other Converted Paper Products (NAICS 32229): This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in one of the following manufacturing 
activities: 
 converting paper and paperboard into products (except containers, bags, 
coated and treated paper and paperboard, and stationery products), or 
 2-36 
 converting pulp into pulp products, such as disposable diapers, or molded pulp 
egg cartons, food trays, and dishes. 
Figure 2-21 shows that the value of shipments for converted paper products was 54% of 
the value of all paper products in 2007, while the value of shipments for pulp, paper, and 
paperboard products was 46%. Figure 2-22 indicates that 70% of industry employees worked in 
the converted paper product category of the industry due to the labor intensive aspects of those 
facilities.

2.3.2 Supply and Demand Characteristics 
Next, we provide a broad overview of the supply and demand sides of the paper 
manufacturing industry. We emphasize the economic interactions this industry has with other 
industries and people and identify the key goods and services used by the industry and the major 
uses and consumers of paper manufacturing products. 
2.3.2.1 Goods and Services Used in Paper Manufacturing 
In 2007, the cost of materials made up 53% of the total shipment value of goods in the 
paper manufacturing industry (Table 2-22). Total compensation of employees represented 15% 
of the total value in 2007, down from 17% in 2005. The total number of employees dropped by 
2%, between 2005 and 2007, while shipments increased by 3% in the same period. 
The top 10 industry groups supplying inputs to the paper manufacturing subsector 
accounted for 70% of the total intermediate inputs according to 2008 Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA) data (Table 2-23). Inputs for pulp, paper, and paperboard products are notably 
different from inputs for converted paper products because the NAICS 3221 group represents the 
initial step in the paper manufacturing process; thus, its inputs include more raw resources such 
as wood products, forestry and logging products, natural gas, and electricity. This becomes 
evident when observing inputs for converted paper products: 49% of the cost of inputs comes 
from pulp, paper, and paperboard products. 
2.3.2.1.1 Energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) categorizes paper manufacturing 
(NAICS 322) as an energy-intensive subsector. The 2008 Annual Energy Outlook predicts that 
the paper-producing subsector will be one of four subsectors experiencing positive average 
growth of delivered energy consumption between 2006 and 2030 (DOE, 2008). 
Energy generation from the recovery boiler is often insufficient for total plant needs, so 
facilities augment recovery boilers with fossil fuel–fired and wood waste–fired boilers (hogged 
fuel) to generate steam and often electricity. Industry wide, the use of pulp wastes, bark, and 
other papermaking residues supplies 58% of the energy requirements of pulp and paper 
companies (EPA, 2002). 
Likewise, Table 2-24 shows that total energy use decreased between 1998 and 2006 by 
14%. Figure 2-24 indicates that total electrical power use changed sporadically between 2002 
and 2004 but decreased consistently and rapidly after 2004.

Over the last 25 years, the pulp and paper subsector has changed its energy generation 
methods from fossil fuels to a greater use of processes such as increases in the use of wood 
wastes in place of fuel (Table 2-25). During the 1972–1999 period, the proportion of total 
industry power generated from the combination of woodroom wastes, spent liquor solids, and 
other self-generated methods increased from about 41% to about 56%, while coal, fuel oil, and 
natural gas use decreased from about 54% to about 36% (EPA, 2002).

2.3.2.2 Uses and Consumers 
Products manufactured in the NAICS groups 3221 and 3222 have different, but 
complementary, consumer profiles. NAICS 3221 supplies a significant portion of NAICS 3222 
demand (37% of total commodity output). Both industries specialize in products with 
intermediate uses, with an average of 92% of sales between the two going toward this purpose. 
NAICS 3222 has a very diverse assortment of subsector groups from which it receives demand. 
Food manufacturing makes up 21% of the demand, making members of this industry the largest 
consumer of converted paper products (Table 2-26). Pulp, paper, and paperboard products have a 
large trade deficit, while converted paper products have a very small trade surplus.

2.3.3 Firm and Market Characteristics 
This section describes geographic, production, and market data. These data provide the 
basis for further analysis, including regulatory flexibility analyses, and give a complete picture of 
the recent historical trends of production and pricing. 
2.3.3.1 Location 
As Figure 2-24 illustrates, California is home to the most paper manufacturing 
establishments in the United States, followed by Illinois and some bordering northeastern states. 
The location of establishments in the paper manufacturing industry varies a great deal by 
subsector. Wisconsin and New York have the most pulp, paper, and paperboard establishments, 
while California dominates with over 500 converted paper product establishments. Overall, the 
United States has 561 pulp, paper, and paperboard establishments and 4,956 converted paper 
product establishments.

2.3.3.2 Production Capacity and Utilization 
Capacity utilization of the paper manufacturing subsector has been experiencing a steady 
decline, similar to the decline of the total manufacturing sector. However, paper manufacturing 
has managed to use its capacity at a consistently higher rate than the average for manufacturing 
industries (Figure 2-25).

2.3.3.4 Plants and Capacity 
While the manufacturing sector has been growing consistently since 1997, the paper 
manufacturing sector has not experienced the same amount of success in the same period. 
Despite a small amount of growth in capacity between 1997 and 2001, the paper manufacturing 
subsector’s capacity has declined to as much as 7% below 1997 capacity levels (Figure 2-27). 
2.3.3.5 Firm Characteristics 
In 2006, the top 10 paper and forest product companies produced over $75 billion in 
sales, with the top two companies—International Paper and Weyerhaeuser—generating nearly 
$22 billion each (Table 2-27). The top two companies’ revenue consists of 58% of the revenue of 
the top 10 companies in Standard & Poor’s (S&P’s) list (Benwart, 2006). Although these 
numbers do not exclusively reflect paper products, they do convey the market environment in 
which firms in this sector compete.

2.3.3.6 Size Distribution 
The primary criterion for categorizing a business as small is the number of employees, 
using definitions by the SBA for regulatory flexibility analyses. According to SUSB reports for 
2002, large companies dominated revenue-generating transactions in the paper manufacturing 
subsector; 80% of receipts were generated by companies with 500 employees or more 
(Table 2-28). This was especially true in the pulp, paper, and paperboard group, in which large 
companies generated 92% of receipts. The number of employees in the small business cutoff 
varies according to six-digit NAICS codes (Table 2-29). The cutoff for all subsectors in the pulp, 
paper, and paperboard group is 750 employees, while the cutoff for most converted paper 
product groups is 500 employees.

2.3.3.7 Domestic Production 
Similar to industry capacity rates, subsector production rates for paper manufacturing 
have witnessed a decreasing rate of production compared to the steady increase in production for 
the manufacturing sector since 1997 (Figure 2-28). It seems that the paper manufacturing sector 
was not able to return to its former levels of growth following the 2001 recession; it has 
experienced a downward production trend since then.

2.3.3.8 International Trade 
Since 1997, paper manufacturing products, both pulp, paper, and paperboard products 
and converted paper products, have contributed to an increasing trade surplus in this sector 
(Figure 2-29). Imports and exports have been changing at similar rates since 1999. 
2.3.3.9 Market Prices 
Prices of goods in paper manufacturing have been increasing at a rate consistent with all 
manufacturing products (Figure 2-30). Producer price indices (PPIs) show that producer prices 
for paper in 2007 increased by 20% since 1997, while producer prices for all manufacturing 
goods increased by roughly 27%.

2.4 Chemical Manufacturing 
2.4.1 Introduction 
The chemical manufacturing industry produces over 70,000 chemical substances, many 
of which are ubiquitous in American life. Broadly speaking, chemical manufacturing operates by 
converting feedstocks into chemical products that can serve as intermediate goods or final 
products such as medicine, soap, and printer ink. From 1997 to2007, shipments in the industry 
grew 42%, while employment declined by 8% (Table 2-30). While total payroll dropped 0.6% 
over this time, annual payroll per employee rose 7.8% from 1997 to 2007 because of the decline 
in the number of employees (Table 2-31). Shipments per employee grew 54% from 1997 to 
2007, with much of that growth taking place between 2002 and 2006 (Table 2-31). 
Chemical manufacturing (NAICS 325) covers a diverse set of industry groups, which we 
have aggregated into the following three groups: 
 Bulk Chemicals—Includes the most energy-intensive industry groups as aggregated 
by the Department of Energy (DOE) (DOE/EIA-0554, 2008): Basic Chemical 
Manufacturing (NAICS 3251); Resin, Rubber, and Artificial Fibers Manufacturing 
(NAICS 3252); and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing (NAICS 3253). 
 Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing (NAICS 3254)—Consists primarily of 
pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing. This industry group is the largest importer 
of goods within chemical manufacturing. 
 Other Chemical Manufacturing: Consists of Paint, Coating, and Adhesive 
Manufacturing (NAICS 3255); Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toiletry 
Manufacturing (NAICS 3256); and Other Chemical Product and Preparation 
Manufacturing (NAICS 3259). 
In 2007, each of these groups generated approximately one-third of the total employment in 
chemical manufacturing (Figure 2-31). The bulk chemicals group accounted for the biggest share 
of chemical manufacturing’s total value of shipments (Figure 2-32).

2.4.2 Supply and Demand Characteristics 
Next, we provide a broad overview of the supply and demand side of the chemical 
manufacturing industry. We emphasize the economic interactions this industry has with other 
industries and people, including identifying the key goods and services used by the industry and 
the major uses and consumers of chemical manufacturing products. 
The top 10 industry groups supplying inputs to the chemical manufacturing industry in 
2002 accounted for 71% of the total intermediate inputs (Table 2-32). Bulk chemicals’ 
production was the most energy intensive, using 79% of the chemical manufacturing inputs from 
petroleum and coal products, electric power generation, transmission and distribution, and 
natural gas distribution.

2.4.2.1 Goods and Services Used in Chemical Manufacturing 
In2007, the cost of materials made up 49% of chemical manufacturing’s total shipment 
value (Table 2-32). Total compensation to employees represented 9% of total shipment value, 
down from 10% in 2005. 
2.4.2.1.1 Energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) classifies bulk chemical 
manufacturing as an energy-intensive industry. Pharmaceuticals and other chemical 
manufacturing are categorized as non-energy-intensive industries, grouped together with other 
industry groups under the “Balance of Manufacturing” category (DOE, 2008). 
Fuel used in chemical production can either facilitate chemical processes or provide the 
feedstock to derive value-added chemicals. In 2007, 70% of chemical manufacturing’s energy 
bill was spent on fuel used as feedstocks (O’Reilly, 2008). These fuel costs represented 2% of 
chemical manufacturing’s total value of shipments (Table 2-33). 
As a whole, chemical manufacturing use less energy over the last 10 years. According to 
DOE, natural gas use by the chemical manufacturing industry dropped 30% from 1998 to 2006, 
and electricity use fell 10% (Table 2-34). From 1997 to 2005, when data ceased to be available, 
chemical manufacturing used less electricity relative to the manufacturing sector as a whole 
(Figure 2-33). 
2.4.2.2 Uses and Consumers 
Products manufactured in the groups bulk chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other 
chemicals have very different consumer profiles. Bulk chemicals is dominated by intermediate 
use, representing 93% of its total commodity output and 56% of the total intermediate use of 
chemical manufacturing products. Pharmaceuticals has both a high level of demand from 
personal consumption, accounting for 67% of the total personal consumption of chemical 
manufacturing products, and a large trade deficit (Table 2-35).

a Net electricity is obtained by summing purchases, transfers in, and generation from noncombustible renewable 
resources, minus quantities sold and transferred out. It does not include electricity inputs from on-site 
cogeneration or generation from combustible fuels because that energy has already been included as generating 
fuel (for example, coal). 
b Distillate fuel oil includes Nos. 1, 2, and 4 fuel oils and Nos. 1, 2, and 4 diesel fuels. 
c Natural gas includes natural gas obtained from utilities, local distribution companies, and any other supplier(s), 
such as independent gas producers, gas brokers, marketers, and any marketing subsidiaries of utilities. 
d Examples of liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) are ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, normal butane, butylene, 
ethane-propane mixtures, propane-butane mixtures, and isobutene produced at refineries or natural gas processing 
plants, including plants that fractionate raw natural gas liquids (NGLs). 
e Other includes net steam (the sum of purchases, generation from renewables, and net transfers), and other energy 
that respondents indicated was used to produce heat and power.

2.4.3 Firm and Market Characteristics 
This remaining subsection describes geographic, production, and market data. These data 
provide the basis for further analysis, including regulatory flexibility analyses, and give a 
complete picture of the recent historical trends of production and pricing. 
2.4.3.1 Location 
In 2002, California had the most chemical manufacturing establishments in the United 
States, followed by Texas and New Jersey (Figure 2-34). The composition of establishments in 
these states differs among the different industry groups. Despite the fact that each group 
employed an approximately equal share of people in 2002, 54% of the total establishments were 
other chemicals establishments, and only 13% were pharmaceutical establishments.

2.4.3.2 Production Capacity and Utilization 
Capacity utilization of the chemical manufacturing industry has been broadly in line with 
the manufacturing sector (Figure 2-35). In the second half of 2005, the chemical manufacturing 
industry’s capacity utilization fell dramatically because of the multiple hurricanes affecting the 
Gulf Coast states. The impact of the economic downturn in 2001 can be seen in the capacity 
utilization of both manufacturing and chemical manufacturing. 
2.4.3.3 Employment 
The geographic distribution of employment in chemical manufacturing differs largely 
among the different groups. In California, 52% of the chemical manufacturing employment 
comes from the pharmaceutical industry, while 60% of the chemical manufacturing employment 
in the Gulf Coast states comes from bulk chemicals manufacturing (Figure 2-36). 
2.4.3.4 Plants and Capacity 
Production capacity in chemical manufacturing has grown 33% since 1997. This growth, 
however, is 9% less than the growth rate for the manufacturing industry as a whole 
(Figure 2-37).

2.4.3.5 Firm Characteristics 
In 2007, the top six companies by chemical sales had greater than $10 billion in sales. 
Together, their sales are greater than the next 44 highest chemical companies combined. These, 
however, are global companies, with a large portion of both sales and production coming from 
operations outside of the United States (Table 2-36). The largest chemical manufacturing 
company, Dow Chemicals, has 108 out of 150 manufacturing sites located outside of the United 
States (Dow Chemical Company, 2008). 
In 2007, 58%of U.S. chemical manufacturing corporations generated net income. 
Including those with and without net income, chemical manufacturers had an average before-tax 
profit margin of 10.24%. Profitability is highest for pharmaceutical and medicine corporations 
(Table 2-37).

2.4.3.6 Size Distribution 
The primary criterion for categorizing a business as small is number of employees, using 
definitions by the SBA for regulatory flexibility analyses. The data describing size standards are 
provided in Table 2-38. In 2002, enterprises with fewer than 500 employees accounted for 27% 
of employment and 15% of receipts within the chemical manufacturing industry). 
2.4.3.7 Domestic Production 
In the late 1990s, overall manufacturing production was growing much faster than the 
chemical manufacturing component (Figure 2-38). Following the recession of 2001, however, 
the components have moved broadly in line with one another, except for the drop in chemical 
manufacturing production caused by the hurricane season of 2005. 
2.4.3.8 International Trade 
In the year 2000, the United States moved from having a trade surplus to a trade deficit in 
chemical manufacturing products (Figure 2-39). This change occurred because the trade deficit 
in pharmaceutical manufacturing, currently at $35 billion, overwhelmed the trade surplus of bulk 
chemicals and other chemical manufacturing combined, currently at $22 billion. 
2.4.3.9 Market Prices 
Prices of goods in chemical manufacturing have accelerated rapidly in the last 2 years, 
having outpaced overall manufacturing since 2002 (Figure 2-40). Much of this recent 
acceleration seen in the industry PPI is due to the bulk chemicals segment, largely reflecting the 
rapid increase in fertilizer prices.

SECTION 3 
ENGINEERING COST ANALYSIS 
We provide an overview of the engineering cost analysis used to estimate the additional 
private expenditures industry may make in order to comply with the rule. A detailed discussion 
of the methodology used to estimate cost impacts is presented in Appendices C and D. 
3.1 Major Sources 
To estimate the national cost impacts of the proposed rule for existing sources, EPA 
developed average baseline emission factors for each fuel type/control device combination based 
on the emission data obtained and contained in the Boiler MACT emission database. If a unit 
reported emission data, we assigned its unit-specific emission data as its baseline emissions. For 
units that did not report emission data, we assigned the appropriate emission factors to each 
existing unit in the inventory database, based on the average emission factors for boilers with 
similar fuel, design, control devices. We then compared each unit’s baseline emission factors to 
the proposed MACT floor emission limit to determine if control devices were needed to meet the 
emission limits. The control analysis considered fabric filters, carbon bed adsorbers, and 
activated carbon injection to be the primary control devices for mercury control, electrostatic 
precipitators for units meeting mercury limits but requiring additional control to meet the PM 
limits, wet scrubbers to meet the HCl limits, tune-ups, replacement burners, and combustion 
controls for CO and organic HAP control, and carbon injection for dioxin/furan control. We 
identified where one control device could achieve reductions in multiple pollutants, for example 
a fabric filter was expected to achieve both PM and mercury control in order to avoid 
overestimating the costs. We also included costs for testing and monitoring requirements 
contained in the proposed rule. The resulting total national cost impact of the proposed rule is 
10.0 billion dollars in capital expenditures and 3.2 billion dollars per year in total annual costs. 
Considering estimated fuel savings resulting from work practice standards and combustion 
controls, the total annualized costs are reduced to 2.9 billion. The total capital and annual costs 
include costs for control devices, work practices, testing and monitoring. Table 3-1 of this shows 
the capital and annual cost impacts for each subcategory. Costs include testing and monitoring 
costs, but not recordkeeping and reporting costs.

Using Department of Energy projections on fuel expenditures, the number of additional 
boilers that could be potentially constructed was estimated. The resulting total national cost 
impact of the proposed rule in the 3rd year is 17 million dollars in capital expenditures and 6.2 
million dollars per year in total annual costs, when considering a 1 percent fuel savings. 
A discussion of the methodology used to estimate cost impacts is presented in 
“Methodology and Results of Estimating the Cost of Complying with the Industrial, 
Commercial, and Institutional Boiler and Process Heater NESHAP (2010)” in the Docket. 
3.2 Area Sources 
To estimate the national cost impacts of the proposed rule for existing sources, EPA 
developed several model boilers and determined the cost of control for these model boilers. The 
EPA assigned a model boiler to each existing unit based on the fuel, size, and current controls. 
The analysis considered all air pollution control equipment currently in operation at existing 
boilers. Model costs were then assigned to all existing units that could not otherwise meet the 
proposed standards. The resulting total national cost impact of the proposed rule for existing 
units is $279 million dollars in total annualized costs after considering fuel savings from 
efficiency improvements. The total annualized costs for installing controls, conducting an annual 
 3-3 
tune-up and an energy assessment, and implementing testing and monitoring requirements, is 
$696 million. Table 3-2 of this preamble shows the total annualized cost impacts for each 
subcategory.

b Impacts for new units assume the number of units online in the first 3 years of this rule (2010 to 2013). 
EPA also estimated the number of additional boilers that could be potentially constructed. 
The resulting total national cost impact of the proposed rule on new sources by the 3rd year, 
2013, is $311 million dollars in total annualized costs. When accounting for a 1 percent fuel 
savings resulting from improvements to combustion efficiency, the total national cost impact on 
new sources is $260 million.

SECTION 4 
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
EPA prepares an RIA to provide decision makers with a measure of the social costs of 
using resources to comply with a program (EPA, 2000). The social costs can then be compared 
with estimated social benefits (as presented in Section 6). As noted in EPA’s (2000) Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses, several tools are available to estimate social costs and range 
from simple direct compliance cost methods to the development of a more complex market 
analysis that estimates market changes (e.g., price and consumption) and economic welfare 
changes (e.g., changes in consumer and producer surplus). 
The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) adopted a standard market 
analysis as described in the Office’s resource manual (EPA, 1999). The approach uses a single-
period multimarket partial equilibrium model to compare pre-policy market baselines with 
expected post-policy market outcomes. The analysis’ time horizon is the intermediate run; some 
production factors are fixed and some are variable and is distinguished from the very short run 
where all factors are fixed and producers cannot adjust inputs or outputs (EPA, 1999, 5-6). The 
intermediate time horizon allows us to capture important transitory stakeholder outcomes. Key 
measures in this analysis include industry-level changes in price levels, production and 
consumption, jobs, international trade, and social costs (changes in producer and consumer 
surplus). 
4.1 Partial Equilibrium Analysis (Multiple Markets) 
The partial equilibrium analysis develops a market model that simulates how stakeholders 
(consumers and industries) might respond to the additional regulatory program costs. In this 
section, we provide an overview of the economic model. Appendix A provides additional details 
on the behavioral assumptions, data, parameters, and model equations. 
4.1.1 Overview 
Although several tools are available to estimate social costs, current EPA guidelines 
suggest that multimarket models “…are best used when potential economic impacts and equity 
effects on related markets might be considerable” and modeling using a computable general 
equilibrium model is not available or practical (EPA, 2000, p. 146). Other guides for 
environmental economists offer similar advice (Berck and Hoffmann, 2002; Just, Hueth, and 
Schmitz, 2004). Multimarket models focus on “short-run” time horizons and measure a policy’s 
near-term or transition costs (EPA, 1999). The multimarket model contains the following 
features: 
 4-2 
 Industry sectors and benchmark data set 
– 100 industry sectors 
– a single benchmark year (2010) 
– estimates of industry employment 
 Economic behavior 
– industries respond to regulatory costs by changing production rates 
– market prices rise and fall to reflect higher energy and other non-energy material 
costs and changes in demand 
– customers respond to these price increases and consumption falls 
 Model scope 
– 100 sectors are linked with each other based on their use of energy and other non-
energy materials. For example, the construction industry is linked with the 
petroleum, cement, and steel industries and is influenced by price changes that 
occur in each sector. The links allow EPA to account for indirect effects the 
regulation has on related markets. 
– production adjustments influence employment levels 
– international trade (imports/exports) responds to domestic price changes 
 Model time horizon (“short run”) for a single period (2013) 
– fixed production resources (e.g., capital) lead to an upward-sloping industry supply 
function 
– firms cannot alter input mixes; there is no substitution among production inputs 
(capital, labor, energy intermediates, and other intermediate goods and services) 
– price of labor (i.e., wage) is fixed 
– investment and government expenditures are fixed 
4.1.2 Economic Impact Analysis Results 
4.1.2.1 Market-Level Results 
Market-level impacts include price and quantity adjustments including the changes in 
international trade (Figure 4-1). Under the proposed major source NESHAP, the Agency’s 
economic model suggests the average national prices for industrial sectors could be 0.01% higher 
with the NESHAP, while average annual domestic production may fall by about 0.01%. Because 
of higher domestic prices, imports rise by 0.01% per year. Market-level effects for the proposed 
area source NESHAP are smaller when compared to the proposed major source rule; average 
 4-3 
 
Figure 4-1. Market-Level Changes by Source and Option 
 
price, production, and import changes are less than 0.01%. Industrial sector details are provided in 
Appendix B. 
4.1.2.2 Social Cost Estimates Major Source Rule 
In the near term, the Agency’s economic model suggests that industries are able to pass on 
$0.8 billion (2008$) of the proposed area source rule’s costs to U.S. households in the form of 
higher prices (Table 4-1). Existing U.S. industries’ surplus falls by $2.5 billion and the net loss in 
aggregate is $3.3 billion. As U.S. prices rise, other countries are affected through international 
trade relationships. The price of goods produced in the United States increase slightly and 
domestic production declines, replaced to a certain degree by imports; the model estimates a net 
gain of $0.1 billion to foreign companies. After accounting for international trade effects, the 
Agency’s economic model projects the net surplus loss associated with the proposed rule is $3.2 
billion. As shown in Figure 4-2, the surplus losses are concentrated in other services (20 percent); 
lumber, paper, and printing (19 percent); and chemicals (16 percent)

The Agency also considered other elements of the engineering cost analysis that could not 
be modeled within the multimarket model (e.g., fuel savings benefits [existing and new major 
sources] and total annualized compliance costs [new major sources]). The net effect of the 
adjustments is a total surplus loss estimate of $2.9 billion. 
4.1.2.3 Social Cost Estimates Area Source Rule 
In the near term, the Agency’s economic model suggests that industries are able to pass on 
$0.3 billion (2008$) of the proposed area source rule’s costs to U.S. households in the form of 
higher prices (Table 4-2). Existing U.S. industries’ surplus falls by $0.3 billion and the net loss 
for U.S. stakeholders is $0.6 billion. As U.S. prices rise, other countries are affected through 
international trade relationships. Households that buy U.S. exports pay higher prices and purchase 
fewer U.S. produced goods. Other countries that that sell goods to the United States benefit; the 
model estimates a net rest of the world gain of less than $0.1 billion. After accounting for 
international trade effects, the Agency’s economic model projects the net surplus (consumer and 
producer) loss associated with the proposed rule is $0.6 billion. As shown in Figure 4-3, the 
surplus losses are concentrated in the other services (86 percent ).

The Agency also considered other elements of the engineering cost analysis that could not 
be modeled within the multimarket model (e.g., fuel-savings benefits [existing and new area 
sources] and total annualized compliance costs [unknown existing and new area sources]). The 
net effect of the adjustments is a total surplus loss estimate of $0.5 billion. 
4.1.2.4 Job Effects 
Precise job effect estimates cannot be estimated with certainty. Morgenstern et al. (2002) 
identify three economic mechanisms by which pollution abatement activities can indirectly 
influence jobs: 
 higher production costs raise market prices, higher prices reduce consumption, and 
employment within an industry falls (“demand effect”); 
 pollution abatement activities require additional labor services to produce the same 
level of output (“cost effect”); and

 post regulation production technologies may be more or less labor intensive (i.e., 
more/less labor is required per dollar of output) (“factor-shift effect”). 
Several empirical studies, including Morgenstern et al. (2002), suggest the net 
employment decline is zero or economically small (e.g., Cole and Elliot, 2007; Berman and Bui, 
2001). However, others show the question has not been resolved in the literature (Henderson, 
1996; Greenstone, 2002).  Morgenstern et al. use a six-year panel (U.S. Census data for plant-
level prices, inputs (including labor), outputs, and environmental expenditures) to econometrically 
estimate the production technologies and industry-level demand elasticities. Their identification 
strategy leverages repeat plant-level observations over time and uses plant-level and year fixed 
effects (e.g., plant and time dummy variables). After estimating their model, Morgenstern show 
and compute the change in employment associated with an additional $1 million ($1987) in 
environmental spending. Their estimates cover four manufacturing industries (pulp and paper, 
plastics, petroleum, and steel) and Morgenstern, et al. present results separately for the cost, factor 
shift, and demand effects, as well as the net effect. They also estimate and report an industry-wide 
average parameter that combines the four industry-wide estimates and weighting them by each 
industry’s share of environmental expenditures. 
EPA has most often estimated employment changes associated with plant closures due to 
environmental regulation or changes in output for the regulated industry (EPA, 1999a; EPA, 
2000). This analysis goes beyond what EPA has typically done in two ways. First, because the 
multimarket model provides estimates for changes in output for sectors not directly regulated, we 
were able to estimate a more comprehensive “demand effect.” Secondly, parameters estimated in 
the Morgenstern paper were used to estimate all three effects (“demand,” “cost,” and “factor 
shift”). This transfer of results from the Morgenstern study is uncertain but avoids ignoring the 
“cost effect” and the “factor-shift effect.” 
We calculated “demand effect” employment changes by assuming that the number of jobs 
declines proportionally with multi-market model’s simulated output changes. These results were 
calculated for all sectors in the EPA model that show a change in output. 
We also calculated a similar “demand effect” estimate that used the Morgenstern paper. 
EPA selected this paper because the parameter estimates (expressed in jobs per million ($1987) of 
environmental compliance expenditures) provide a transparent and tractable way to transfer 
estimates for an employment effects analysis.  Similar estimates were not available from other 
studies. To do this, we multiplied the point estimate for the total demand effect (−3.56 jobs per 
million ($1987) of environmental compliance expenditure) by the total environmental compliance 
 4-8 
expenditures used in the partial equilibrium model. For example, the jobs effect estimate for the 
Major Source Rule is estimated to be 7,000 jobs (−3.56× $3.2 billion × 0.60).1 Demand effect 
results are provided in Figure 4-4. 
 
Figure 4-4. Job Losses/Gains Associated with the Proposed Rules: 2013 
 
We also present the results of using the Morgenstern paper to estimate employment “cost” 
and “factor-shift” effects. Although using the Morgenstern parameters to estimate these “cost” 
and “factor-shift” employment changes is uncertain, it is helpful to compare the potential job 
gains from these effects to the job losses associated with the “demand” effect. Figure 4-4 shows 
that using the Morgenstern point estimates of parameters to estimate the “cost” and “factor shift” 
employment gains may be greater than the employment losses using either of the two ways of 
estimating “demand” employment losses. The 95% confidence intervals are shown for all of the

estimates based on the Morgenstern parameters. As shown, at the 95% confidence level, we 
cannot be certain if net employment changes are positive or negative. 
Although the Morgenstern paper provides additional information about the potential job 
effects of environmental protection programs, there are several qualifications EPA considered as 
part of the analysis. First, EPA has used the weighted average parameter estimates for a narrow 
set of manufacturing industries (pulp and paper, plastics, petroleum, and steel). Absent other data 
and estimates, this approach seems reasonable and the estimates come from a respected peer-
reviewed source. However, EPA acknowledges the proposed rule covers a broader set of 
industries not considered in original empirical study. By transferring the estimates to other 
industrial sectors, we make the assumption that estimates are similar in size. In addition, EPA 
assumes also that Morgenstern et al.’s estimates derived from the 1979-1991 still applicable for 
policy taking place in 2013, almost 20 years later. Second, the multi-market model only considers 
near term employment effects in a U.S. economy where production technologies are fixed. As a 
result, the modeling system places more emphasis on the short term “demand effect” whereas the 
Morgenstern paper emphasizes other important long term responses. For example, positive job 
gains associated with “factor shift effects” are more plausible when production choices become 
more flexible over time and industries can substitute labor for other production inputs. Third, the 
Morgenstern paper estimates rely on sector demand elasticities that are different from the demand 
elasticity parameters used in the multi-market model. As a result, the demand effects are not 
directly comparable with the demand effects estimated by the multi-market model. Fourth, 
Morgenstern identifies the industry average as economically and statistically insignificant effect 
(i.e., the point estimates are small, measured imprecisely, and not distinguishable from zero.) EPA 
acknowledges this fact and has reported the 95 percent confidence intervals in Figure 4-4. Fifth, 
Morgenstern’s methodology assumes large plants bear most of the regulatory costs. By 
transferring the estimates, EPA assumes a similar distribution of regulatory costs by plant size and 
that the regulatory burden does not disproportionately fall on smaller plants.

SECTION 5 
SMALL ENTITY ANALYSES 
The RFA as amended by SBREFA generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (SISNOSE). Small 
entities include small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit 
enterprises. EPA assessed the potential small entity economic impacts using a screening analysis. 
After reviewing screening analysis results, EPA has determined it cannot certify that the proposed 
rules will not have a SISNOSE and presumes that both proposed rules are not eligible for 
certification under the RFA as amended by SBREFA. As a result, EPA has prepared and included 
an IRFA that discusses alternative regulatory or policy options that minimize the rules’ small 
entity impacts. It includes information about key results from the SBAR panel. 
5.1 Small Entity Screening Analysis 
5.1.1 Small Businesses 
The sectors covered by the rule were identified through lists of small entities at major and 
area sources provided by the engineering analysis. Table 5-1 provides a list of the sectors affected 
(3-digit NAICS) and the range of SBA size definitions. 
5.1.1.1 Representative Small Business Analysis Using Census Statistics of U.S. Businesses 
For each 3-digit NAICS code, the SUSB provides national information on the distribution 
of economic variables by industry and enterprise size (U.S. Census, 2008). The Census Bureau 
and the Office of Advocacy of the SBA supported and developed these files for use in a broad 
range of economic analyses.1 Statistics include the total number of establishments and receipts for 
all entities within an industry; however, only a subset of entities will be covered by the proposed 
rule. SUSB also provides statistics by enterprise employment and receipt size. 
The Census Bureau’s definitions used in the SUSB are as follows: 
 Establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 
conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.

 Receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes. 
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the total employment of all associated establishments. 
Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008) apply to an establishment’s 
“ultimate parent company,” we assumed in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is 
consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for SBREFA 
screening analyses, and the terms are used interchangeably. 
The analysis generated a set of establishment sales tests (represented as cost-to-receipt 
ratios) for NAICS codes associated with sectors listed in Table 5-2. Although the appropriate 
SBA size definition should be applied at the parent company (enterprise) level, we can only 
compute and compare ratios for a model establishment owned by an enterprise within an SUSB 
size range (employment or receipts). Using the SUSB size range helps us account for receipt 
differences between establishments owned by large and small enterprises and also allows us to 
consider the variation in small business definitions across affected industries. Using establishment 
receipts is also a conservative approach, because an establishment’s parent company (the 
“enterprise”) may have other economic resources that could be used to cover the costs of the 
regulatory program. 
For each representative establishment in the SUSB data, we developed a range of facility-
level cost numerators based on the engineering cost analysis. For major sources, we used the 
maximum and minimum small entity facility-level costs observed within each 3-digit NAICS 
code. For area sources, we were limited to two representative small entity facility-level costs 
(approximately $26,000,000 to $1.4 million) 1. Using these cost data and the Census estimates of 
average establishment receipts, a substantial number of SUSB NAICS/enterprise categories have 
ratios over 3% (Figure 5-1). 
                                                 
1 Prior to computing the cost-to-receipt ratios, we adjusted the engineering compliance costs to reflect 2002 dollars 
using the implicit price deflators for gross domestic product (GDP). The values used are 2002 = 92.118 and 2008 
= 108.483 (U.S. BEA, 2010).

5.1.1.2 Additional Small Business Analysis Using Sample of Small Businesses Identified in 
Combustion Facility Survey 
Next, we performed a more detailed analysis that compares the Census SUSB 
representative small entity results with a firm-specific sample of major small private enterprises. 
In this approach, we identified a sample of survey facility names listed as small, traced the 
ultimate parent company name to verify the facility was owned by a small business, and collected 
the most recent parent company sales and employment figures. As Table 5-2 shows, the average 
cost-to-sales ratios for small major source companies are above 5%. The median ratios are below 
one percent for the primary option and above 5 percent for Option 1E.

5.1.2 Small Governmental Jurisdictions and Not-for--Profit Enterprises  
In addition to the private sector, this rule also covers sectors that include entities owned by 
small and large governments and not-for-profit enterprises. Given the uncertainty and data 
limitations associated with identifying and appropriately classifying these entities, we computed a 
“revenue” test, where the annualized compliance cost is a percentage of annual revenues (U.S. 
Census, 2005a and b). 
Compliance costs were estimated for model facilities for major and area sources for 
multiple options. A summary of the compliance costs used for the small entity analysis follows: 
Major Sources: 
 Primary option: $3.0 million (median cost small public facility) 
 Option 1E and 1N: $4.5 million (median cost small public facility) 
Area Sources: 
 Primary option: 
– Other public: $3.0 million 
– Hospital: $11,300 
– Schools: $4,500 
– Churches: $2,200 
 5-6 
 Option 1E and Option 1N: 
– Other public: $2.9 million 
– Hospital: $141,000 
– Schools: $346,000 
– Churches: $45,000 
From the 2002 Census (in 2008 dollars), the average revenue for small governments 
(counties and municipalities with populations fewer than 10,000) are $3 million per entity, and 
the average revenue for local governments with populations fewer than 50,000 is $7 million per 
entity. Churches are assumed to have an operation budget of $150,000. 
The analysis shows that small major source public facilities would have cost-to-revenue 
ratios that exceed 10% under the both regulatory options. The following small area source 
facilities would have cost-to-revenue ratios exceeding 1 percent: 
 Primary option: other public (ratio > 10 percent) and churches (ratio = 1.5 percent) 
 Option 1E and Option 1N: other public (ratio > 10 percent), hospitals (ratio > 3 
percent), schools (ratio > 10 percent), and churches (ratio >10 percent). 
5.2 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IFRA) 
An IRFA illustrates how EPA considered the proposed rule’s small entity effects before a 
rule is finalized and provides information about how the objectives of the rule were achieved 
while minimizing significant economic impacts on small entities. We provide a summary of IRFA 
elements; the preambles for each rule provide additional details. 
5.2.1 Reasons Why Action Is Being Considered 
In 2004, EPA promulgated national emission NESHAP for new and existing 
industrial/commercial/institutional boilers and process heaters. However, in 2007, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit) vacated the NESHAP for 
industrial/commercial/institutional boilers and process heaters. The proposed action provides 
EPA’s proposed rule in response to the court’s vacatur. Under authority of section 112 of the 
Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is also proposing a NESHAP for two area source categories: 
industrial boilers and institutional/commercial boilers. 
5.2.2 Statement of Objectives and Legal Basis of Proposed Rules 
The proposed rules would protect air quality and promote public health by reducing 
emissions of the HAPs. Section 112(d) of the CAA requires EPA to establish NESHAPs for both 
 5-7 
major and area sources of HAPs that are listed for regulation under CAA section 112(c). A major 
source emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any single HAP or 25 
tpy or more of any combination of HAP. An area source is a stationary source that is not a major 
source. 
5.2.3 Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities 
The sectors covered by the rule were identified through lists of small entities at major and 
area sources included in the survey. A listing of the sectors affected (3-digit NAICS) and the 
range of SBA size definitions are provided in Table 5-1. EPA believes a substantial number of 
small entities will be affected by the proposed rules, but data limitations preclude us from 
providing precise estimates of the number of small entities affected. 
5.2.4 Description and Compliance Costs 
5.2.4.1 Major Sources 
A discussion of the methodology used to estimate cost impacts is presented in 
“Methodology and Results of Estimating the Cost of Complying with the Industrial, Commercial, 
and Institutional Boiler and Process Heater NESHAP” in the Docket and Section 4 of the RIA. 
5.2.4.2 Area Sources 
A detailed discussion of the methodology used to estimate cost impacts is presented in the 
memorandum “Estimation of Impacts for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers Area 
Source NESHAP” in the Docket and Section 4 of the RIA. 
5.2.5 Description of Federal Rules that May Overlap or Conflict with Proposed Rules 
The proposed major source rule regulates source categories covering industrial boilers, 
institutional boilers, commercial boilers, and process heaters that may include combustion units 
that are already regulated by other MACT standards. Therefore, EPA proposes to exclude any 
boiler or process heater that is already or will be subject to regulation under another MACT 
standard. Boilers located at area source facilities may be regulated pursuant to CAA section 129. 
Section 129(h) states that no unit subject to standards under section 129 shall be subject to 
standards under section 112(d) of the CAA. As a result, EPA proposes to exclude any boiler that 
is subject to regulation under section 129. EPA has codified new source performance standards 
(NSPS) for industrial boilers (40 CFR 60, subparts Db and Dc), but the NSPS does not regulate 
sources of HAPs. As a result, sources subject to the NSPS will still be subject to the proposed 
rules. However, EPA has minimized the monitoring requirements, testing requirements, and 
recordkeeping requirements to avoid duplicating NSPS requirements.

5.2.6 Description of Regulatory Alternatives that Minimize Significant Economic Impacts on 
Small Entities 
As required by section 609(b) of the RFA, as amended by SBREFA, EPA has conducted 
outreach to small entities and convened a SBAR Panel to obtain advice and recommendation of 
representatives of the small entities that potentially would be subject to the requirements of this 
rule. On January 22, 2009, EPA’s Small Business Advocacy Chairperson convened a Panel under 
section 609(b) of the RFA. In addition to the Chair, the Panel consisted of the Director of the 
Sector Policies and Programs Division within EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget. 
As part of the SBAR Panel process, we conducted outreach with representatives from 14 
various small entities that would be affected by this rule. The small entity representatives (SERs) 
included associations representing schools, churches, hotels/motels, wood product facilities, and 
manufacturers of home furnishings. We met with these SERs to discuss the potential rulemaking 
approaches and potential options to decrease the impact of the rulemaking on their 
industries/sectors. We distributed outreach materials to the SERs; these materials included 
background on the rulemaking, possible regulatory approaches, preliminary cost and economic 
impacts, and possible rulemaking alternatives. The Panel met with SERs from the industries that 
will be directly affected by this rule on February 10, 2009, to discuss the outreach materials and 
receive feedback on the approaches and alternatives detailed in the outreach packet. (EPA also 
met with SERs on November 13, 2008, for an initial outreach meeting.) The Panel received 
written comments from the SERs following the meeting in response to discussions at the meeting 
and the questions posed to the SERs by the Agency. The SERs were specifically asked to provide 
comment on regulatory alternatives that could help minimize the rules’ impact on small 
businesses. 
5.2.6.1 Panel Recommendations for Small Business Flexibilities 
The Panel recommended that EPA consider and seek comment on a wide range of 
regulatory alternatives to mitigate the impacts of the rulemaking on small businesses, including 
those flexibility options described below. The following section summarizes the SBAR Panel 
recommendations. EPA has proposed provisions consistent with four of the Panel’s 
recommendations. 
Consistent with the RFA/SBREFA requirements, the Panel evaluated the assembled 
materials and small-entity comments on issues related to elements of the IRFA. A copy of the 
Final Panel Report (including all comments received from SERs in response to the Panel’s 
 5-9 
outreach meeting), as well as summaries of both outreach meetings that were held with the SERs, 
is included in the docket for the proposed rules. A summary of the Panel recommendations is 
detailed below. The proposals include proposed provisions for all but one of the Panel 
recommendations. 
5.2.6.1.1 Work Practice Standards. The panel recommended that EPA consider requiring 
annual tune-ups, including standardized criteria outlining proper tune-up methods targeted at 
smaller boiler operators. The panel further recommended that EPA take comment on the efficacy 
of energy assessments/audits at improving combustion efficiency and the cost of performing the 
audits, especially to smaller boiler operators. 
A work practice standard, instead of MACT emission limits, may be proposed if it can be 
justified under section 112(h) of the CAA, that is, it is impracticable to enforce the emission 
standards due to technical or economic limitations. Work practice standards could reduce fuel use 
and improve combustion efficiency, which would result in reduced emissions. 
In general, SERs commented that a regulatory approach to improve combustion 
efficiency, such as work practice standards, would have positive impacts with respect to the 
environment and energy use and save on compliance costs. The SERs were concerned with work 
practice standards that would require energy audits and implementation of audit findings. The 
basis of these concerns rested on the uncertainty that there is no guarantee that there are available 
funds to implement a particular audit’s findings. 
5.2.6.1.2 Subcategorization. The Panel recommended that EPA allow subcategorizations 
suggested by the SERs, unless EPA finds that a subcategorization is inconsistent with the CAA. 
SERs commented that subcategorization is a key concept that could ensure that like 
boilers are compared with similar boilers so that MACT floors are more reasonable and could be 
achieved by all units within a subcategory using appropriate emission reduction strategies. SERs 
commented that EPA should subcategorize based on fuel type, boiler type, duty cycle, and 
location. 
5.2.6.1.3 Health Based Compliance Alternatives (HBCA). The Panel recommended that 
EPA adopt the HBCA as a regulatory flexibility option for the boiler MACT rulemaking. The 
panel recognized, however, that EPA has concerns about its legal authority to provide an HBCA 
under the CAA, and EPA may ultimately determine that this flexibility is inconsistent with the 
CAA. 
 5-10 
SERs commented that adopting an HBCA would perhaps be the most important step EPA 
could take to mitigate the serious financial harm the boiler MACT would otherwise inflict on 
small entities using solid fuels nationwide; therefore, HBCA should be a critical component of 
any future rule to lessen the impact on small entities. 
5.2.6.1.4 Emissions Averaging. The Panel recommended that EPA consider a provision 
for emission averaging and long averaging times for the proposed emission limits. 
SERs commented that a measure EPA should consider to lessen the regulatory burden of 
complying with the boiler MACT is to allow emissions averaging at sources with multiple 
regulated units. SERs commented that another approach that can aide small entity compliance is 
to set longer averaging times (i.e., 30 days or more) rather than looking at a mere 3-run (hour) 
average for performance. Given the inherent variability in boiler performance, an annual or 
quarterly averaging period for all HAP would prevent a single spike in emissions from throwing a 
unit into noncompliance. 
5.2.6.1.5 Compliance Costs. The Panel recommended that EPA carefully weigh the 
potential burden of compliance requirements and consider for small entities options, such as 
emission averaging within the facility, reduced monitoring/testing requirements, or allowing more 
time for compliance. 
SERs noted that recordkeeping activities, as written in the vacated boiler MACT, would 
be especially challenging for small entities that do not have a dedicated environmental affairs 
department.

SECTION 6 
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
6.1 Synopsis 
In this section, we provide an estimate of the monetized benefits associated with reducing 
particulate matter (PM) for the proposed Boiler MACT Rule and Boiler Area Source Rule. For 
these rules, the PM reductions are the result of emission limits on PM (as a surrogate for metals) 
as well as emission limits on other HAPs. The total PM2.5 reductions are the consequence of the 
technologies installed to meet these multiple limits. These estimates reflect the monetized human 
health benefits of reducing cases of morbidity and premature mortality among populations 
exposed to the PM2.5 precursors reduced by this rulemaking. Using a 3% discount rate, we 
estimate the total monetized benefits of the proposed Major and Area Source Boiler Rules to be 
$18 billion to $43 billion in the implementation year (2013). Using a 7% discount rate, we 
estimate the total monetized benefits of the proposed Major and Area Source Boiler Rules to be 
$16 billion to $39 billion in the implementation year. All estimates are in 2008$. 
These estimates reflect EPA’s most current interpretation of the scientific literature. 
Higher or lower estimates of benefits are possible using other assumptions; examples of this are 
provided in Figure 6-2. Data, resource, and methodological limitations prevented EPA from 
monetizing the benefits from several important benefit categories, including benefits from 
reducing hazardous air pollutants, ecosystem effects, and visibility impairment. The benefits from 
reducing hazardous air pollutants have not been monetized in this analysis, including reducing 
370,000 tons of carbon monoxide, 37,000 tons of HCl, 1,000 tons of HF, 8.3 tons of mercury, 
3,400 tons of other metals, and 1,200 grams of dioxins/furans each year. 
6.2 Calculation of PM2.5 Human Health Benefits 
This rulemaking would reduce emissions of PM2.5, SO2, and VOCs. Because SOx and 
VOCs are also precursors to PM2.5, reducing these emissions would also reduce PM2.5 formation, 
human exposure, and the incidence of PM2.5-related health effects. For these rules, the PM 
reductions are the result of emission limits on PM (as a surrogate for metals) as well as emission 
limits on other HAPs. The total PM2.5 reductions are the consequence of the technologies installed 
to meet these multiple limits. Due to analytical limitations, it was not possible to provide a 
comprehensive estimate of PM2.5-related benefits. Instead, we used the “benefit-per-ton” 
approach to estimate these benefits based on the methodology described in Fann et al. (2009). The 
key assumptions are described in detail below. These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the 
total monetized human health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) 
 6-2 
of reducing one ton of PM2.5 from a specified source. EPA has used the benefit per-ton technique 
in several previous RIAs, including the recent NO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010b). Table 6-1 
shows the quantified and unquantified benefits captured in those benefit-per-ton estimates.

Consistent with the Portland Cement NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2009a), the PM2.5 benefits 
estimates utilize the concentration-response functions as reported in the epidemiology literature, 
as well as the 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation study as a sensitivity analysis. 
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported in Pope 
et al. (2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary PM benefits 
estimate. 
 One estimate is based on the C-R function developed from the extended analysis of the 
Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by Laden et al. (2006). This study, published 
after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, has been used as 
an alternative estimate in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and PM2.5 benefits estimates in RIAs 
completed since the PM2.5 NAAQS. 
 Twelve estimates are based on the C-R functions from EPA’s expert elicitation study 
(Roman et al., 2008) on the PM2.5 -mortality relationship and interpreted for PM 
benefits analysis in EPA’s final RIA for the PM2.5 NAAQS. For that study, twelve 
experts (labeled A through L) provided independent estimates of the PM2.5 -mortality 
concentration-response function. EPA practice has been to develop independent 
estimates of PM2.5 -mortality estimates corresponding to the concentration-response 
 6-3 
function provided by each of the twelve experts, to better characterize the degree of 
variability in the expert responses. 
The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 
population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).1 These are logical choices for anchor points in our presentation 
because, while both studies are well designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths and 
weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for using both studies to generate benefits 
estimates. Previously, EPA had calculated benefits based on these two empirical studies, but 
derived the range of benefits, including the minimum and maximum results, from an expert 
elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality (Roman et al., 
2008).2 Within this assessment, we include the benefits estimates derived from the concentration-
response function provided by each of the twelve experts to better characterize the uncertainty in 
the concentration-response function for mortality and the degree of variability in the expert 
responses. Because the experts used these cohort studies to inform their concentration-response 
functions, benefits estimates using these functions generally fall between results using these 
epidemiology studies (see Figure 6-2). In general, the expert elicitation results support the 
conclusion that the benefits of PM2.5 control are very likely to be substantial. 
Readers interested in reviewing the methodology for creating the benefit-per-ton estimates 
used in this analysis should consult Fann et al. (2009). As described in the documentation for the 
benefit per-ton estimates cited above, national per-ton estimates are developed for selected 
pollutant/source category combinations. The per-ton values calculated therefore apply only to 
tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source combinations (e.g., SO2 emitted from electric 
generating units; NO2 emitted from mobile sources). Our estimate of PM2.5 control benefits is 
therefore based on the total PM2.5 emissions controlled by sector and multiplied by this per-ton 
value. 
The benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified versions of 
the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis. Specifically, 
this analysis uses the benefit-per-ton method first applied in the Portland Cement NESHAP RIA 
(U.S. EPA, 2009a), which incorporated three updates: a new population dataset, an expanded 
geographic scope of the benefit-per-ton calculation, and the functions directly from the 
                                                 
1 These two studies specify multi-pollutant models that control for SO2, among other pollutants.

in the presentation of benefits estimates.  
 6-4 
epidemiology studies without an adjustment for an assumed threshold.3 Removing the threshold 
assumption is a key difference between the method used in this analysis of PM benefits and the 
methods used in RIAs prior to Portland Cement, and we now calculate incremental benefits down 
to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air quality levels. 
EPA strives to use the best available science to support our benefits analyses, and we 
recognize that interpretation of the science regarding air pollution and health is dynamic and 
evolving. Based on our review of the body of scientific literature, EPA applied the no-threshold 
model in this analysis. EPA’s Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 
2009b), which was recently reviewed by EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. 
EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently 
finds that a no-threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality 
concentration-response relationship while recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape 
of the concentration-response function.4 In conjunction with the underlying scientific literature, 
this document provided a basis for reconsidering the application of thresholds in PM2.5 
concentration-response functions used in EPA’s RIAs. 5 
As is the nature of Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), the assumptions and methods used 
to estimate air quality benefits evolve over time to reflect the Agency’s most current 
interpretation of the scientific and economic literature. For a period of time (2004-2008), the 
Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical life 
(VSL) estimate derived from a limited analysis of some of the available studies. OAR arrived at a 
VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of the 
wage-risk literature. The $1 million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range 
from the Mrozek and Taylor (2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies. The $10 million value 
represented the upper end of the interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-
analysis of 43 studies. The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$)6 was also consistent with the 
mean VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis. However, the 
                                                 
3 The benefit-per-ton estimates have also been updated since the Cement RIA to incorporate a revised VSL, as 
discussed on the next page.  
4 It is important to note that uncertainty regarding the shape of the concentration-response function is conceptually 
distinct from an assumed threshold. An assumed threshold (below which there are no health effects) is a 
discontinuity, which is a specific example of non-linearity.  
5 In the Portland Cement RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a), EPA solicited comment on the use of the no-threshold model for 
benefits analysis within the preamble of that proposed rule. The comment period for the Portland Cement 
proposed NESHAP closed on September 4, 2009 (Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OAR–2002–0051 available at 
http://www.regulations.gov). EPA is currently reviewing those comments. 
6 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2008$) and to account for income 
growth to 2015. After applying these adjustments to the $5.5 million value, the VSL is $7.9m.  
 6-5 
Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected the 
interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board (SAB) or 
other peer-review group. 
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources. In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue. With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and different 
studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated preference) (U.S. 
EPA-SAB, 2007). 
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received. Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)7 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue. This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 1991. 
The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).8 The Agency is committed to using 
scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality risk reductions and has 
made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s specific recommendations. The 
Agency anticipates presenting results from this effort to the SAB-EEAC in Spring 2010 and that 
draft guidance will be available shortly thereafter. 
Figure 6-1 illustrates the relative breakdown of the monetized PM2.5 health benefits. 
                                                 
7 In the (draft) update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2008), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB 
with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the 
near future. Therefore, this report does not represent final agency policy.  
8 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2008$) and to account for income 
growth to 2015. After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $9.1m.

Figure 6-1. Breakdown of Monetized PM2.5 Health Benefits using Mortality Function 
from Pope et al. (2002)a 
a This pie chart breakdown is illustrative, using the results based on Pope et al. (2002) as an example. Using the 
Laden et al. (2006) function for premature mortality, the percentage of total monetized benefits due to adult 
mortality would be 97%. This chart shows the breakdown using a 3% discount rate, and the results would be 
similar if a 7% discount rate was used. 
Tables 6-2 and 6-3 provide a general summary of the results by pollutant, including the 
emission reductions and monetized benefits-per-ton at discount rates of 3% and 7%.9 Table 6-4 
provides a summary of the reductions in health incidences as a result of the pollution reductions. 
In Table 6-5, we provide the benefits using our anchor points of Pope et al. and Laden et al. as 
well as the results from the expert elicitation on PM mortality. Figures 6-2 and 6-3 provide a 
visual representation of the range of benefits estimates and the pollutant breakdown of the 
monetized benefits of the proposed option. 
  
                                                 
9 To comply with Circular A-4, EPA provides monetized benefits using discount rates of 3% and 7% (OMB, 2003). 
These benefits are estimated for a specific analysis year (i.e., 2013), and most of the PM benefits occur within that 
year with two exceptions: acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and premature mortality. For AMIs, we assume 5 
years of follow-up medical costs and lost wages. For premature mortality, we assume that there is a “cessation” 
lag between PM exposures and the total realization of changes in health effects. Although the structure of the lag 
is uncertain, EPA follows the advice of the SAB-HES to assume a segmented lag structure characterized by 30% 
of mortality reductions in the first year, 50% over years 2 to 5, and 20% over the years 6 to 20 after the reduction 
in PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004). Changes in the lag assumptions do not change the total number of estimated 
deaths but rather the timing of those deaths. Therefore, discounting only affects the AMI costs after the analysis 
year and the valuation of premature mortalities that occur after the analysis year. As such, the monetized benefits 
using a 7% discount rate are only approximately 10% less than the monetized benefits using a 3% discount rate.

6.3 Unquantified Benefits 
The monetized benefits estimated in this RIA only reflect the portion of benefits 
attributable to the health effect reductions associated with ambient fine particles. Data, resource, 
and methodological limitations prevented EPA from quantifying or monetizing the benefits from 
several important benefit categories, including benefits from reducing toxic emissions, ecosystem 
effects, and visibility impairment. The health benefits from reducing thousands of tons of 
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and millions of tons of carbon monoxide each year have not been 
monetized in this analysis. In addition to being a PM2.5 precursor, SO2 emissions also contribute 
to adverse effects from acidic deposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, increase mercury 
methylation, as well as visibility impairment. 
6.3.1 Carbon Monoxide Benefits 
Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is associated with a variety of health effects. Without 
knowing the location of the emission reductions and the resulting ambient concentrations using 
fine-scale air quality modeling, we were unable to estimate the exposure to CO for nearby 
populations. Due to data, resource, and methodological limitations, we were unable to estimate

the benefits associated with the 370,000 tons reductions in CO emissions that would occur as a 
result of this rule. 
Carbon monoxide in ambient air is formed primarily by the incomplete combustion of 
carbon-containing fuels and photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The amount of CO 
emitted from these reactions, relative to carbon dioxide (CO2), is sensitive to conditions in the 
combustion zone, such as fuel oxygen content, burn temperature, or mixing time. Upon 
inhalation, CO diffuses through the respiratory system to the blood, which can cause hypoxia 
(reduced oxygen availability). Carbon monoxide can elicit a broad range of effects in multiple 
tissues and organ systems that are dependent upon concentration and duration of exposure. 
The Integrated Science Assessment for Carbon Monoxide (U.S. EPA, 2010a) concluded 
that short-term exposure to CO is “likely to have a causal relationship” with cardiovascular 
morbidity, particularly in individuals with coronary heart disease. Epidemiologic studies associate 
short-term CO exposure with increased risk of emergency department visits and hospital 
admissions. Coronary heart disease includes those who have angina pectoris (cardiac chest pain), 
as well as those who have experienced a heart attack. Other subpopulations potentially at risk 
include individuals with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, 
or diabetes, and individuals in very early or late life stages, such as older adults or the developing 
young. The evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship between short-term exposure to CO 
and respiratory morbidity and mortality. The evidence is also suggestive of a causal relationship 
for birth outcomes and developmental effects following long-term exposure to CO, and for central 
nervous system effects linked to short- and long-term exposure to CO. 
6.3.2 Other SO2 Benefits 
In addition to being a precursor to PM2.5, SO2 emissions are also associated with a variety 
of respiratory health effects. Unfortunately, we were unable to estimate the health benefits 
associated with reduced SO2 exposure in this analysis because we do not have air quality 
modeling data available. Without knowing the location of the emission reductions and the 
resulting ambient concentrations, we were unable to estimate the exposure to SO2 for nearby 
populations. Therefore, this analysis only quantifies and monetizes the PM2.5 benefits associated 
with the reductions in SO2 emissions. 
Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and laboratory 
studies, the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for Sulfur Dioxide concluded that there is a 
causal relationship between respiratory health effects and short-term exposure to SO2 (U.S. EPA, 
2008). The immediate effect of SO2 on the respiratory system in humans is bronchoconstriction. 
 6-14 
Asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of SO2 likely resulting from preexisting inflammation 
associated with this disease. A clear concentration-response relationship has been demonstrated in 
laboratory studies following exposures to SO2 at concentrations between 20 and 100 ppb, both in 
terms of increasing severity of effect and percentage of asthmatics adversely affected. Based on 
our review of this information, we identified four short-term morbidity endpoints that the SO2 
ISA identified as a “causal relationship”: asthma exacerbation, respiratory-related emergency 
department visits, and respiratory-related hospitalizations. The differing evidence and associated 
strength of the evidence for these different effects is described in detail in the SO2 ISA. The SO2 
ISA also concluded that the relationship between short-term SO2 exposure and premature 
mortality was “suggestive of a causal relationship” because it is difficult to attribute the mortality 
risk effects to SO2 alone. Although the SO2 ISA stated that studies are generally consistent in 
reporting a relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, there was a lack of robustness of the 
observed associations to adjustment for pollutants. 
SO2 emissions also contribute to adverse welfare effects from acidic deposition, visibility 
impairment, and enhanced mercury methylation. Deposition of sulfur causes acidification, which 
can cause a loss of biodiversity of fishes, zooplankton, and macro invertebrates in aquatic 
ecosystems, as well as a decline in sensitive tree species, such as red spruce (Picea rubens) and 
sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in terrestrial ecosystems. In the northeastern United States, the 
surface waters affected by acidification are a source of food for some recreational and subsistence 
fishermen and for other consumers and support several cultural services, including aesthetic and 
educational services and recreational fishing. Biological effects of acidification in terrestrial 
ecosystems are generally linked to aluminum toxicity, which can cause reduced root growth, 
which restricts the ability of the plant to take up water and nutrients. These direct effects can, in 
turn, increase the sensitivity of these plants to stresses, such as droughts, cold temperatures, insect 
pests, and disease leading to increased mortality of canopy trees. Terrestrial acidification affects 
several important ecological services, including declines in habitat for threatened and endangered 
species (cultural), declines in forest aesthetics (cultural), declines in forest productivity 
(provisioning), and increases in forest soil erosion and reductions in water retention (cultural and 
regulating). (U.S. EPA, 2008d) 
Reducing SO2 emissions and the secondary formation of PM2.5 would improve the level of 
visibility throughout the United States. Fine particles with significant light-extinction efficiencies 
include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996). These 
suspended particles and gases degrade visibility by scattering and absorbing light. Higher 
visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine particles, 
 6-15 
particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels. In fact, particulate sulfate is the 
largest contributor to regional haze in the eastern U.S. (i.e., 40% or more annually and 75% 
during summer). In the western U.S., particulate sulfate contributes to 20-50% of regional haze 
(U.S. EPA, 2009c). Visibility has direct significance to people’s enjoyment of daily activities and 
their overall sense of wellbeing. Good visibility increases the quality of life where individuals live 
and work, and where they engage in recreational activities. 
6.3.3 HAP Benefits 
Due to data, resource, and methodology limitations, we were unable to estimate the 
benefits associated with the thousands tons of hazardous air pollutants that would be reduced as a 
result of this rule. Available emissions data show that several different HAPs are emitted from 
boilers, either contained within the fuel burned or formed during the combustion process. 
Although numerous HAPs may be emitted from boilers, a few HAPs account for the 
majority of the total mass of HAPs emissions. See Table 6-6 for the list of the major HAPs for 
each fuel type. This rule is anticipated to reduce 370,000 tons of carbon monoxide, 37,000 tons of 
HCl, 1,000 tons of HF, 8.3 tons of mercury, and 3,400 tons of other metals, 1,200 grams of 
dioxins/furans each year from major and area sources. We discuss the health effects associated 
with these top HAPs as well as the HAPs for which we have emission reduction estimates.

6.3.3.1 Mercury 
Mercury is a highly neurotoxic contaminant that enters the food web as a methylated 
compound, methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008d). The contaminant is concentrated in higher trophic 
levels, including fish eaten by humans. Experimental evidence has established that only 
inconsequential amounts of methylmercury can be produced in the absence of sulfate (U.S. EPA, 
2008d). Current evidence indicates that in watersheds where mercury is present, increased sulfate 
deposition very likely results in methylmercury accumulation in fish (Drevnick et al., 2007; 
Munthe et al, 2007). The SO2 ISA concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a casual 
 6-16 
relationship between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and aquatic 
environments (U.S. EPA, 2008d). 
In addition to the role of sulfate deposition on methylation, these proposed rules would 
also reduce mercury emissions. Mercury is emitted to the air from various man-made and natural 
sources. These emissions transport through the atmosphere and eventually deposit to land or 
water bodies. This deposition can occur locally, regionally, or globally, depending on the form of 
mercury emitted and other factors such as the weather. The form of mercury emitted varies 
depending on the source type and other factors. Available data indicate that the mercury 
emissions from these sources are a mixture of gaseous elemental mercury, inorganic ionic 
mercury, and particulate bound mercury. Gaseous elemental mercury can be transported very long 
distances, even globally, to regions far from the emissions source (becoming part of the global 
“pool”) before deposition occurs. Inorganic ionic and particulate bound mercury have a shorter 
atmospheric lifetime and can deposit to land or water bodies closer to the emissions source. 
Furthermore, elemental mercury in the atmosphere can undergo transformation into ionic 
mercury, providing a significant pathway for deposition of emitted elemental mercury. 
Major and area source boilers emitted about 16 tons of mercury in the air in 2008 in the 
U.S. Based on the EPA’s National Emission Inventory, about 103 tons of mercury were emitted 
from all anthropogenic sources in the U.S. in 2005. Moreover, the United Nations has estimated 
that about 2,100 tons of mercury were emitted worldwide by anthropogenic sources in 2005. We 
believe that total mercury emissions in the U.S. and globally in 2008 were about the same 
magnitude in 2005. Therefore, we estimate that in 2008, these sources emitted about 16% of the 
total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the U.S. and about 0.8% of the global emissions. 
Overall, this rule would reduce mercury emissions by about 8.3 tons per year from current levels, 
and therefore, contribute to reductions in mercury exposures and health effects. Due to time and 
resource limitations, we were unable to model mercury dispersion, deposition, methylation, 
bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and human consumption of mercury-contaminated fish that would 
be needed in order to estimate the human health benefits from reducing mercury emissions.  
Potential exposure routes to mercury emissions include both direct inhalation and 
consumption of fish containing methylmercury. The primary route of human exposure to mercury 
emissions from industrial sources is generally indirectly through the consumption of fish 
containing methylmercury. As described above, mercury that has been emitted to the air 
eventually settles into water bodies or onto land where it can either move directly or be leached 
into waterbodies. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a 
highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. Consumption of fish 
 6-17 
and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury exposure to humans. Methylmercury builds 
up more in some types of fish and shellfish than in others. The levels of methylmercury in fish 
and shellfish vary widely depending on what they eat, how long they live, and how high they are 
in the food chain. Most fish, including ocean species and local freshwater fish, contain some 
methylmercury. For example, in recent studies by EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 
of fish tissues, every fish sampled contained some methylmercury. 
The majority of fish consumed in the U.S. are ocean species. The methylmercury 
concentrations in ocean fish species are primarily influenced by the global mercury pool. 
However, the methylmercury found in local fish can be due, at least partly, to mercury emissions 
from local sources. Research shows that most people’s fish consumption does not cause a 
mercury-related health concern. However, certain people may be at higher risk because of their 
routinely high consumption of fish (e.g., tribal and other subsistence fishers and their families 
who rely heavily on fish for a substantial part of their diet). It has been demonstrated that high 
levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the 
developing nervous system, making the child less able to think and learn. Moreover, mercury 
exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of 
all ages. 
Several studies suggest that the methylmercury content of fish may reduce these cardio-
protective effects of fish consumption.  Some of these studies also suggest that methylmercury 
may cause adverse effects to the cardiovascular system.  For example, the NRC (2000) review of 
the literature concerning methylmercury health effects took note of two epidemiological studies 
that found an association between dietary exposure to methylmercury and adverse cardiovascular 
effects.10  Moreover, in a study of 1,833 males in Finland aged 42 to 60 years, Solonen et al. 
(1995) observed a relationship between methylmercury exposure via fish consumption and acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attacks), coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
all-cause mortality.11  The NRC also noted a study of 917 seven year old children in the Faroe 
Islands, whose initial exposure to methylmercury was in utero although post natal exposures may 
have occurred as well.  At seven years of age, these children exhibited an increase in blood

pressure and a decrease in heart rate variability.12 Based on these and other studies, NRC 
concluded in 2000 that, while “the data base is not as extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is 
for other end points (i.e. neurologic effects) the cardiovascular system appears to be a target for 
methylmercury toxicity.”13   
Since publication of the NRC report there have been some 30 published papers presenting 
the findings of studies that have examined the possible cardiovascular effects of methylmercury 
exposure.  These studies include epidemiological, toxicological, and toxicokinetic investigations.  
Over a dozen review papers have also been published.   If there is a causal relationship between 
methylmercury exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects, then reducing exposure to 
methylmercury would result in public health benefits from reduced cardiovascular effects. 
In early 2010, EPA sponsored a workshop in which a group of experts were asked to 
assess the plausibility of a causal relationship between methylmercury exposure and 
cardiovascular health effects and to advise EPA on methodologies for estimating population level 
cardiovascular health impacts of reduced methylmercury exposure. The report from that 
workshop is in preparation. 
6.3.3.2 Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) 14 
Hydrogen chloride gas is intensely irritating to the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, 
and respiratory tract. Brief exposure to 35 ppm causes throat irritation, and levels of 50 to 100 
ppm are barely tolerable for 1 hour. The greatest impact is on the upper respiratory tract; exposure 
to high concentrations can rapidly lead to swelling and spasm of the throat and suffocation. Most 
seriously exposed persons have immediate onset of rapid breathing, blue coloring of the skin, and 
narrowing of the bronchioles. Patients who have massive exposures may develop an accumulation 
of fluid in the lungs. Exposure to hydrogen chloride can lead to Reactive Airway Dysfunction 
Syndrome (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma. Children may be more 
vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because of the relatively smaller diameter of their 
airways. Children may also be more vulnerable to gas exposure because of increased minute

ventilation per kg and failure to evacuate an area promptly when exposed. Hydrogen chloride has 
not been classified for carcinogenic effects.  
6.3.3.3 Chlorine gas (Cl2) 15 
Chlorine gas is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Exposure to 
chlorine may cause burning of the eyes, nose, and throat; cough as well as constriction and edema 
of the airway and lungs can occur.  
6.3.3.4 Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) 16 
Hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic by all routes of exposure and may cause abrupt onset of 
profound central nervous system, cardiovascular, and respiratory effects, leading to death within 
minutes. Exposure to lower concentrations of hydrogen cyanide may produce eye irritation, 
headache, confusion, nausea, and vomiting followed in some cases by coma and death. Hydrogen 
cyanide acts as a cellular asphyxiant. By binding to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, it prevents 
the utilization of oxygen in cellular metabolism. The central nervous system and myocardium are 
particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of cyanide. 
6.3.3.5 Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) 17 
Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to gaseous hydrogen fluoride can cause severe 
respiratory damage in humans, including severe irritation and pulmonary edema. Chronic (long-
term) exposure to fluoride at low levels has a beneficial effect of dental cavity prevention and 
may also be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis. Exposure to higher levels of fluoride may 
cause dental fluorosis. One study reported menstrual irregularities in women occupationally 
exposed to fluoride. The EPA has not classified hydrogen fluoride for carcinogenicity.

6.3.3.6 Toluene18 
Toluene is found in evaporative as well as exhaust emissions from motor vehicles. Under 
the 2005 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, there is inadequate information to assess 
the carcinogenic potential of toluene because studies of humans chronically exposed to toluene 
are inconclusive, toluene was not carcinogenic in adequate inhalation cancer bioassays of rats and 
mice exposed for life, and increased incidences of mammary cancer and leukemia were reported 
in a lifetime rat oral bioassay. 
The central nervous system (CNS) is the primary target for toluene toxicity in both 
humans and animals for acute and chronic exposures. CNS dysfunction (which is often reversible) 
and narcosis have been frequently observed in humans acutely exposed to low or moderate levels 
of toluene by inhalation; symptoms include fatigue, sleepiness, headaches, and nausea. Central 
nervous system depression has been reported to occur in chronic abusers exposed to high levels of 
toluene. Symptoms include ataxia, tremors, cerebral atrophy, nystagmus (involuntary eye 
movements), and impaired speech, hearing, and vision. Chronic inhalation exposure of humans to 
toluene also causes irritation of the upper respiratory tract, eye irritation, dizziness, headaches, 
and difficulty with sleep. 
Human studies have also reported developmental effects, such as CNS dysfunction, 
attention deficits, and minor craniofacial and limb anomalies, in the children of women who 
abused toluene during pregnancy. A substantial database examining the effects of toluene in 
subchronic and chronic occupationally exposed humans exists. The weight of evidence from these 
studies indicates neurological effects (i.e., impaired color vision, impaired hearing, decreased 
performance in neurobehavioral analysis, changes in motor and sensory nerve conduction 
velocity, headache, dizziness) as the most sensitive endpoint. 
6.3.3.7 Formaldehyde 
Since 1987, EPA has classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen based on 
evidence in humans and in rats, mice, hamsters, and monkeys.19 EPA is currently reviewing 
recently published epidemiological data. For instance, research conducted by the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) found an increased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer and lymphohematopoietic

malignancies such as leukemia among workers exposed to formaldehyde.20,21 In an analysis of the 
lymphohematopoietic cancer mortality from an extended follow-up of these workers, NCI 
confirmed an association between lymphohematopoietic cancer risk and peak exposures.22 A 
recent National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study of garment workers 
also found increased risk of death due to leukemia among workers exposed to formaldehyde.23 
Extended follow-up of a cohort of British chemical workers did not find evidence of an increase 
in nasopharyngeal or lymphohematopoietic cancers, but a continuing statistically significant 
excess in lung cancers was reported.24 
In the past 15 years there has been substantial research on the inhalation dosimetry for 
formaldehyde in rodents and primates by the CIIT Centers for Health Research (formerly the 
Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology), with a focus on use of rodent data for refinement of 
the quantitative cancer dose-response assessment.25,26,27 CIIT’s risk assessment of formaldehyde 
incorporated mechanistic and dosimetric information on formaldehyde. However, it should be 
noted that recent research published by EPA indicates that when two-stage modeling assumptions 
are varied, resulting dose-response estimates can vary by several orders of magnitude.28,29,30,31 
These findings are not supportive of interpreting the CIIT model results as providing a

conservative (health protective) estimate of human risk.32 EPA research also examined the 
contribution of the two-stage modeling for formaldehyde towards characterizing the relative 
weights of key events in the mode-of-action of a carcinogen. For example, the model-based 
inference in the published CIIT study that formaldehyde’s direct mutagenic action is not relevant 
to the compound’s tumorigenicity was found not to hold under variations of modeling 
assumptions.33 
Based on the developments of the last decade, in 2004, the working group of the IARC 
concluded that formaldehyde is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), on the basis of sufficient 
evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental animals - a higher classification than 
previous IARC evaluations. After reviewing the currently available epidemiological evidence, the 
IARC (2006) characterized the human evidence for formaldehyde carcinogenicity as “sufficient,” 
based upon the data on nasopharyngeal cancers; the epidemiologic evidence on leukemia was 
characterized as “strong.”34 EPA is reviewing the recent work cited above from the NCI and 
NIOSH, as well as the analysis by the CIIT Centers for Health Research and other studies, as part 
of a reassessment of the human hazard and dose-response associated with formaldehyde. 
Formaldehyde exposure also causes a range of noncancer health effects, including 
irritation of the eyes (burning and watering of the eyes), nose and throat. Effects from repeated 
exposure in humans include respiratory tract irritation, chronic bronchitis and nasal epithelial 
lesions such as metaplasia and loss of cilia. Animal studies suggest that formaldehyde may also 
cause airway inflammation – including eosinophil infiltration into the airways. There are several 
studies that suggest that formaldehyde may increase the risk of asthma – particularly in the 
young.35,36

6.3.3.8 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
At least seven PAH compounds are classified by EPA as probable human carcinogens 
based on animal data, including benzo(a)anthracene37, benzo(b)fluoranthene38, 
benzo(k)fluoranthene39, benzo(a)pyrene40, chrysene41, dibenz(a,h)anthracene42, and indeno(1,2,3-
cd)pyrene43. Recent studies have found that maternal exposures to PAHs in a population of 
pregnant women were associated with several adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight 
and reduced length at birth, as well as impaired cognitive development at age three.44,45 EPA has 
not yet evaluated these recent studies. 
6.3.3.9 Acetaldehyde 
Acetaldehyde is classified in EPA’s IRIS database as a probable human carcinogen, based 
on nasal tumors in rats, and is considered toxic by the inhalation, oral, and intravenous routes.46 
Acetaldehyde is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen by the U.S. DHHS in the 11th 
Report on Carcinogens and is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by the

IARC.47,48 EPA is currently conducting a reassessment of cancer risk from inhalation exposure to 
acetaldehyde. 
The primary noncancer effects of exposure to acetaldehyde vapors include irritation of the 
eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.49 In short-term (4 week) rat studies, degeneration of olfactory 
epithelium was observed at various concentration levels of acetaldehyde exposure.50 Data from 
these studies were used by EPA to develop an inhalation reference concentration. Some 
asthmatics have been shown to be a sensitive subpopulation to decrements in functional 
expiratory volume (FEV1 test) and bronchoconstriction upon acetaldehyde inhalation.51 The 
agency is currently conducting a reassessment of the health hazards from inhalation exposure to 
acetaldehyde. 
6.3.3.10 Nickel52 
Nickel is an essential element in some animal species, and it has been suggested it may be 
essential for human nutrition. Nickel dermatitis, consisting of itching of the fingers, hand and 
forearms, is the most common effect in humans from chronic (long-term) skin contact with 
nickel. Respiratory effects have also been reported in humans from inhalation exposure to nickel. 
No information is available regarding the reproductive or developmental effects of nickel in 
humans, but animal studies have reported such effects. Human and animal studies have reported 
an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers from exposure to nickel refinery dusts and nickel 
subsulfide. Animal studies of soluble nickel compounds (i.e., nickel carbonyl) have reported lung 
tumors. The EPA has classified nickel refinery subsulfide as Group A, human carcinogens and 
nickel carbonyl as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.

6.3.3.11 Manganese53 
Health effects in humans have been associated with both deficiencies and excess intakes 
of manganese. Chronic (long-term) exposure to low levels of manganese in the diet is considered 
to be nutritionally essential in humans, with a recommended daily allowance of 2 to 5 milligrams 
per day. Chronic exposure to high levels of manganese by inhalation in humans results primarily 
in CNS effects. Visual reaction time, hand steadiness, and eye-hand coordination were affected in 
chronically-exposed workers. Manganism, characterized by feelings of weakness and lethargy, 
tremors, a masklike face, and psychological disturbances, may result from chronic exposure to 
higher levels. Impotence and loss of libido have been noted in male workers afflicted with 
manganism attributed to inhalation exposures. The EPA has classified manganese in Group D, not 
classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans. 
6.3.3.12 Dioxins (Chlorinated dibenzodioxins (CDDs) 54 
A number of effects have been observed in people exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD levels that 
are at least 10 times higher than background levels. The most obvious health effect in people 
exposure to relatively large amounts of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is chloracne. Chloracne is a severe skin 
disease with acne-like lesions that occur mainly on the face and upper body. Other skin effects 
noted in people exposed to high doses of 2,3,7,8-TCDD include skin rashes, discoloration, and 
excessive body hair. Changes in blood and urine that may indicate liver damage also are seen in 
people. Alterations in the ability of the liver to metabolize (or breakdown) hemoglobin, lipids, 
sugar, and protein have been reported in people exposed to relatively high concentrations of 
2,3,7,8-TCDD. Most of the effects are considered mild and were reversible. However, in some 
people these effects may last for many years. Slight increases in the risk of diabetes and abnormal 
glucose tolerance have been observed in some studies of people exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD. We do 
not have enough information to know if exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD would result in reproductive 
or developmental effects in people, but animal studies suggest that this is a potential health 
concern.  
In certain animal species, 2,3,7,8-TCDD is especially harmful and can cause death after a 
single exposure. Exposure to lower levels can cause a variety of effects in animals, such as weight

loss, liver damage, and disruption of the endocrine system. In many species of animals, 2,3,7,8-
TCDD weakens the immune system and causes a decrease in the system's ability to fight bacteria 
and viruses at relatively low levels (approximately 10 times higher than human background body 
burdens). In other animal studies, exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD has caused reproductive damage and 
birth defects. Some animal species exposed to CDDs during pregnancy had miscarriages and the 
offspring of animals exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD during pregnancy often had severe birth defects 
including skeletal deformities, kidney defects, and weakened immune responses. In some studies, 
effects were observed at body burdens 10 times higher than human background levels.  
6.3.3.13 Furans (Chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs)) 55 
Most of the information on the adverse health effects comes from studies in people who 
were accidentally exposed to food contaminated with CDFs. The amounts that these people were 
exposed to were much higher than are likely from environmental exposures or from a normal diet. 
Skin and eye irritations, especially severe acne, darkened skin color, and swollen eyelids with 
discharge, were the most obvious health effects of the CDF poisoning. CDF poisoning also 
caused vomiting and diarrhea, anemia, more frequent lung infections, numbness, effects on the 
nervous system, and mild changes in the liver. Children born to exposed mothers had skin 
irritation and more difficulty learning, but it is unknown if this effect was permanent or caused by 
CDFs alone or CDFs and polychlorinated biphenyls in combination. 
Many of the same effects that occurred in people accidentally exposed also occurred in 
laboratory animals that ate CDFs. Animals also had severe weight loss, and their stomachs, livers, 
kidneys, and immune systems were seriously injured. Some animals had birth defects and 
testicular damage, and in severe cases, some animals died. These effects in animals were seen 
when they were fed large amounts of CDFs over a short time, or small amounts over several 
weeks or months. Nothing is known about the possible health effects in animals from eating 
CDFs over a lifetime. 
6.3.3.14 Other Air Toxics 
In addition to the compounds described above, other compounds in gaseous hydrocarbon 
and PM emissions from boilers would be affected by this rule. Information regarding the health 
effects of these compounds can be found in EPA’s IRIS database.56

6.4 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Monetized PM2.5 Benefits 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 
are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs it may be possible to provide a statistical representation 
of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the necessary 
information is not available. 
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors such 
as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5) (U.S. EPA, 2006), 
there are a variety of uncertainties associated with these PM benefits. Therefore, the estimates of 
annual benefits should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of benefits expected, rather 
than the actual benefits that would occur every year. 
We performed a couple of sensitivity analyses on the benefits results to assess the 
sensitivity of the primary results to various data inputs and assumptions. We then changed each 
default input one at a time and recalculated the total monetized benefits to assess the percent 
change from the default. We present the results of this sensitivity analysis in Table 6-7. We 
indicated each input parameter, the value used as the default, and the values for the sensitivity 
analyses, and then we provide the total monetary benefits for each input and the percent change 
from the default value for the proposed option. 
Above we present the estimates of the total monetized benefits, based on our interpretation 
of the best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-HES and the 
NAS (NRC, 2002). The benefits estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and 
uncertainties. For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for premature mortality, 
which typically account for at least 90% of the total monetized benefits, we were able to quantify 
include the following:

1. PM2.5 benefits were derived through benefit per-ton estimates, which do not reflect 
local variability in population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health 
incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an over-estimate or under-
estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted fine particulates. 
2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally 
potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, because PM2.5 
produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ significantly from 
direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial sources, but no clear 
scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects estimates by particle type. 
3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear down to the 
lowest air quality levels modeled in this analysis. Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM2.5, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations. 
4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality (which typically accounts for 85% to 95% of total monetized benefits), we 
include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation study in 
addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the 
uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed and 
transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the 
overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be interpreted 
within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. For more 
information on the uncertainties associated with PM2.5 benefits, please consult the 
PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5-5). 
 6-29 
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the 
benefits model. Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and associated 
estimates of uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the significant 
differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. However, the 
results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in Chapter 5 of 
the PM NAAQS RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the benefits 
results presented in this analysis. 
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits 
modeling assumptions. For example, these estimates do not reflect local variability in population 
density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors. Use of 
these $/ton values to estimate benefits associated with different emission control programs (e.g., 
for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) may lead to higher or lower 
benefit estimates than if benefits were calculated based on direct air quality modeling. Great care 
should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions occurring in any specific 
location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission reduction programs and 
therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United States. The benefits- per-ton 
for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different than the estimates presented 
here. 
6.5 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
Using a 3% discount rate, we estimate the total combined monetized benefits of the 
proposed Boiler MACT and Area Source Rule to be $18 billion to $45 billion in the 
implementation year (2013). Using a 7% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized benefits 
of the proposed Boiler MACT and Area Source Rule to be $17 billion to $40 billion. The 
combined annualized social costs of the proposed Boiler MACT and Area Source Rule are $3.4 
billion at a 7% interest rate.57  Thus, the combined net benefits are $15 billion to $41 billion at a 
3% discount rate and $13 billion to $37 billion at a 7% discount rate. All estimates are in 2008$ 
for the year 2013.  
The annualized social costs of the proposed Boiler MACT only are $2.9 billion, and the 
annualized social costs of the proposed Area Source Rule are $500 million at a 7% discount rate. 
The net benefits for the proposed Boiler MACT for major sources only are $14 billion to $38 
                                                 
57 For more information on the annualized social costs, please refer to Section 4 of this RIA. 
 6-30 
billion and $12 billion to $34 billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively. The net benefits 
for the Boiler Area Source rule only are $500 million to $1.9 billion and $410 million to $1.7 
billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively. All estimates are in 2008$ for the year 2013.  
Tables 6-8 and 6-9 show a summary of the monetized benefits, social costs, and net 
benefits for the proposed options and the alternative options for the Boiler MACT for Major 
Sources and for the Boiler Area Source Rule, respectively. Figures 6-4 and 6-5 show the full 
range of net benefits estimates (i.e., annual benefits minus annualized costs) utilizing the 14 
different PM2.5 mortality functions at discount rates of 3% and 7%. In addition, the benefits from 
reducing 370,000 tons of carbon monoxide, 37,000 tons of HCl, 1,000 tons of HF, 8.3 tons of 
mercury, 3,400 tons of other metals, and 1,200 grams of dioxins/furans each year from major and 
area sources have not been included in these estimates. EPA believes that the benefits are likely to 
exceed the costs under this rulemaking even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost 
and benefit estimates.

SECTION 7 
SUPPLEMENTAL ECONOMIC ANALYSES FOR NON-HAZARDOUS SOLID WASTE 
DEFINITION 
EPA also considered an economic analysis for an alternate approach for defining non-
hazardous solid waste. Under the alternative approach, the universe of sources in the energy 
recovery and waste burning cement kiln subcategories would change while the number of sources 
in the remaining three subcategories (i.e., incinerators, burn-off ovens, and small, remote 
incinerators) does not change. This section provides an overview of the results. 
7.1 Economic Impact Analysis Results 
7.1.1 Market-Level Results 
Market-level impacts include price and quantity adjustments including the changes in 
international trade (Table 7-1). The Agency’s economic model suggests the average national 
market-level variables (prices, production-levels, consumption, and international trade) will not 
significantly change (e.g., are less than 0.5%).  
7.1.2 Social Cost Estimates 
In the near term, the Agency’s economic model suggests that industries are able to pass on 
$0.7 billion (2008$) of the costs to U.S. households in the form of higher prices (Table 7-2). 
Existing U.S. industries’ surplus falls by $2.0 billion, and the net loss for U.S. stakeholders is 
$2.7 billion. Households that buy U.S. exports pay higher prices and purchase fewer U.S. 
produced goods. Other countries that that sell goods to the United States benefit; the model 
estimates a net rest of the world gain of $0.1 billion. After accounting for international trade 
effects, the Agency’s economic model projects the net surplus loss associated with the proposed 
rule is $2.6 billion. The Agency also considered other elements of the engineering cost analysis 
that could not be modeled within the multimarket model (e.g., 0.4 billion in fuel savings) which 
reduces the social cost estimate to 2.2 billion.  
7.1.3 Job Effects 
Near-term employment changes associated with the proposed rule are estimated to be less 
than 5,000 job losses; over a longer time period, net employment effects could range between 
4,000 job losses to 9,000 job gains. Additional details and caveats associated with these estimates 
are present in section 4.

7.2 Benefits Analysis Results 
Table 7-4 provides a general summary of the alternate approach results by pollutant, 
including the emission reductions and monetized benefits-per-ton at discount rates of 3% and 7%. 
These estimates reflect EPA’s most current interpretation of the scientific literature. Higher or 
lower estimates of benefits are possible using other assumptions, but most expert-derived 
estimates fall within these estimates. Data, resource, and methodological limitations prevented 
EPA from monetizing the benefits from several important benefit categories, including benefits 
from reducing hazardous air pollutants, ecosystem effects, and visibility impairment. The benefits 
from reducing hazardous air pollutants have not been monetized in this analysis, including 
reducing 280,000 tons of carbon monoxide, 5,100 tons of HCl, 1,100 tons of HF, and 7.1 tons of 
mercury, and 290 grams of dioxins/furans from major sources each year. Tables 7-5 shows a 
summary of the monetized benefits, social costs, and net benefits for the alternative definition for 
the Boiler MACT for existing major sources.

APPENDIX A 
OAQPS MULTIMARKET MODEL TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC  
IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL  
REGULATION 
 
 A-1 
A.1 Introduction 
An economic impact analysis (EIA) provides information about a policy’s effects (i.e., 
social costs); emphasis is also placed on how the costs are distributed among stakeholders (EPA, 
2000). In addition, large-scale policies require additional analysis to better understand how costs 
are passed across the economy. Although several tools are available to estimate social costs, 
current EPA guidelines suggest that multimarket models “…are best used when potential 
economic impacts and equity effects on related markets might be considerable” and modeling 
using a computable general equilibrium model is not available or practical (EPA, 2000, p. 146). 
Other guides for environmental economists offer similar advice (Berck and Hoffmann, 2002; 
Just, Hueth, and Schmitz, 2004). 
Multimarket models focus on “short-run” time horizons and measure a policy’s near term 
or transition costs (EPA, 1999). Recent studies suggest short-run analyses can complement full 
dynamic general equilibrium analysis. 
The multimarket model described in this appendix is a new addition to the Office of Air 
Quality Planning and Standards’ (OAQPS’s) economic model tool kit; it is designed to be used 
as a transparent tool that can respond quickly to requests about how stakeholders in 100 U.S. 
industries might respond to new environmental policy. Next, we provide an overview of the 
model, data, and parameters. 
A.2 Multimarket Model 
The multimarket model contains the following features: 
 Industry sectors and benchmark data set 
– 100 industry sectors 
– a single benchmark year (2010) 
– estimates of industry carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
– estimates of industry employment 
 Economic behavior 
– industries respond to regulatory costs by changing production rates 
– market prices rise to reflect higher energy and other nonenergy material costs 
– customers respond to these price increases and consumption falls 
 Model scope 
 A-2 
 100 sectors are linked with each other based on their use of energy and other 
nonenergy materials. For example, the construction industry is linked with the 
petroleum, cement, and steel industries and is influenced by price changes that occur 
in each sector. The links allow EPA to account for indirect effects the regulation has 
on related markets. 
–  Links come from input-output information used from OAQPS’s computable 
general equilibrium model (EMPAX) 
– production adjustments influence employment levels 
– international trade (imports/exports) behavior considered 
 Model time horizon (“short-run”) 
– fixed production resources (e.g., capital) leads to an upward-sloping industry 
supply function 
– firms cannot alter input mixes; there is no substitution among production inputs 
(capital, labor, energy intermediates, and other intermediates) 
– price of labor (i.e., wage) is fixed 
– investment and government expenditures are fixed 
A.2.1 Industry Sectors and Benchmark Data Set 
The multimarket model includes 100 industries. For the benchmark year, the model uses 
information from OAQPS’s computable general equilibrium model’s balanced social accounting 
matrix (SAM) and the following accounting identity holds (EPA, 2008): 
 Output + Imports = Consumption + Investment + Government + Exports (A.1) 
If we abstract and treat each industry as a national market, the identity represents the 
prepolicy market-clearing condition, or benchmark “equilibrium”; supply equals demand in each 
market. In Table A-1, we identify the 100 industries for the multimarket model; Table A-2 
provides the 2010 benchmark data set. Since the benchmark data are reported in value terms, we 
also use the common “Harberger convention” and choose units where are all prices are one in the 
benchmark equilibrium (Shoven and Whalley, 1995).

A.2.1.2 Employment Data 
The model includes employment forecasts for each of the 100 sectors. Employment 
estimates are based on data from three sources: the AEO 2009 estimates of employment (AEO 
supplemental Table 126 and indicators of Macroeconomic Activity), and Global Insights, Inc., 
and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2008 end-of year-employment (Current Employment 
Statistics—CES [National]). Typically, 3-digit NAICS sectors’ employment estimates are either 
directly reported in the updated AEO 2009 release or Global Insights For multimarket industries 
with finer NAICs detail, estimates were calculated by selecting a primary NAICS supersector 
estimate (AEO or Global Insights) and distributing total employment from the larger NAICS 
supersectors across more detailed NAICS sectors within the super-sector. The distributions were 
determined using observed 2008 BLS employment data. In the last step, In order to match 
aggregate U.S. employment numbers reported in the AEO 2009 release (140.1 million), a single 
adjustment factor was applied to all sectors that use Global Insights’ supersector data.1 Table A-4 
reports the baseline employment for each of the 100 sectors. 
A.2.2 Economic Behavior 
A.2.2.1 U.S. Supply 
In a postpolicy scenario, industry responds to changes in the new market-clearing “net” 
price for the good or service sold: 
 %Δ”net” price = %Δ market price − %Δ direct costs − %Δ indirect costs (A.2) 
The %Δ direct costs are approximated using the engineering cost analysis and baseline 
value of output. For example, a $1 billion increase in compliance costs for the electricity sector 
(ELE) would be represented in the model as follows: 
 %Δ direct costs = $1/$317= 0.03% (A.3) 
As shown in Figure A-1, the cost change provides the industry with incentives to alter 
production rates at current market prices; market prices must rise to maintain the original 
prepolicy production levels (Q). 
  
                                                 
1 This step is required because Global Insight’s data used by EPA are an older vintage than the forecasts used in the 
AEO.

The multimarket model also simultaneously considers how the policy influences other 
important production costs (via changes in energy and other intermediate material prices). As a 
result, the multimarket model can provide additional information about how policy costs are 
transmitted through the economy. As shown in Figure A-2, the indirect cost change provides the 
industry with additional incentives to alter production rates at current market prices. 
The %Δ indirect effects associated with each input are approximated using an input “use” 
ratio and the price change that occurs in the input market. 
 %Δ indirect costs = input use ratio x %Δ input price (A.4) 
The social accounting matrix provides an internally consistent estimate of the use ratio 
and describes the dollar amount of an input that is required to produce a dollar of output. Higher 
ratios suggest strong links between industries, while lower ratios suggest weaker links. Given the 
short time horizon, we assume the input use ratio is fixed and cannot adjust their input mix; this 
is a standard assumption in public and commercial input-output (IO) and SAM multiplier models 
(Berck and Hoffmann, 2002). Morgenstern and colleagues (2004) and Ho and colleagues (2008) 
also use this assumption when examining near-term effects of environmental policy.

Following guidance in the OAQPS economic resource manual (OAQPS, 1999), we use a 
general form for the U.S. industry supply function: 
 
gεn
i
iigigg )PP(tPbQ 

  


 (A.5) 
where 
gQ  = with-policy supply quantity (g) 
b  = calibrated scale parameter for the supply price relationship 
gP  = with-policy price for output (g) 
t  = direct compliance costs per unit of supply 
gi  = input use ratio (g using input i) 
iP  = with-policy input (i) price 
iP  = benchmark input (i) price 
g  = price elasticity of supply for output (g) 
The key supply parameter that controls the industry production adjustments is the price 
elasticity of supply (εg). To our knowledge, there is no existing empirical work that estimates 
short-run supply elasticities for all industry groups used in the multimarket model. As a result, 
we assume the U.S. supply elasticities are a function of econometrically estimated rest-of-world 
(ROW) export supply elasticities (see discussion in the next section). We report the values 
currently available in the model in Table A-5. 
 A-16 
A.2.2.2 International Competition 
International competition is captured by a single ROW supply function: 
   ROWgεgg PcQ   (A.6) 
where 
gQ  = with-policy supply quantity (g) 
c = calibrated scale parameter for the supply and price relationship 
gP  = with-policy U.S. price for output (g) 
ROW
g  = price elasticity of supply of goods from the ROW to the United States (imports) 
(g) 
The key supply parameter that controls the ROW supply adjustments is the price 
elasticity of supply ( ROWg ). We obtained these estimates for a variety of industry groups from a 
recently published article by Broda and colleagues (2008b). 
A.2.2.3 Price Elasticity of Supply: Rest of World (ROW) 
Broda and colleagues (2008) provide an empirical basis for the multimarket model supply 
elasticities. Broda et al. provide over 1,000 inverse elasticities that RTI organized to be 
comparable with the 100-sector model. The first step was to match the Harmonized Trade 
System (HS) elasticities estimated in the article to the appropriate NAICS codes. Many of the HS 
codes correspond with a detailed NAICS codes (5- and 6-digit level), while the multimarket 
sector industries typically correspond with more aggregated sectors (NAICS 2-, 3-, or 4-digit 
levels). To adapt these labels to our model, we combined the 5- and 6- digit NAICS under their 
3- and 4-digit codes and calculated an average inverse elasticity value for codes that fell within 
the multimarket model’s aggregate industrial sectors. This gives a crude way to account for the 
variety of products detailed in the original data set. We also restricted the elasticity sample to 
those that Broda et al. classify as “medium” and “low” categories; these categories tend to have 
lower elasticity values that are consistent with the multimarket model’s modeling horizon (i.e., in 
the short run importers are likely to have less flexibility to respond to price changes and 
elasticities are low).1 
                                                 
1 Broda et al.’s intent was to use these categories to describe or proxy for domestic market power.

Note: RTI mapped Broda et al. data for their industry aggregation to the multimarket model’s 100 industries. 
Domestic supply elasticities are typically assumed to be within one standard deviation of the sample of supply 
elasticities used for the ROW. In selected cases where this information is not available, the U.S. supply elasticity 
is set equal to the ROW.

ities.html. Accessed September 2009. 
Our ideal preference was to use an exact 3- or 4-digit match from the medium category if 
one was available. If the multimarket model had a 4-digit code for which there was no direct 
match, we aggregated up a level and applied the relevant 3-digit elasticity. If a multimarket code 
was not covered in the medium set of elasticities, we used the low elasticity category. This 
method was sufficient for mapping the majority of the sectors in the model. After applying our 
inverse elasticity values to the multimarket sectors, we calculated the inverse of the value to 
arrive at the actual supply elasticity. Since Broda et al.’s article focused on industrial production 
goods, some of the multimarket sectors were not covered in the elasticity data. These sectors 
included mainly service industries, transportation, and energy sources. 
In order to fill these gaps, we turned to the source substitution elasticities from Purdue 
University’s Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)1. Although the elasticities in the GTAP 
model are a different type of international trade elasticity and cannot be directly applied in the 
multimarket model (e.g., they are based on the Armington structure2), the parameters provide us 
with some additional information about the relative trade elasticity differences between industry 
sectors. To use the GTAP information to develop assumptions about the multimarket model 
sectors with missing elasticities, we chose a base industrial sector (iron and steel) for which we 
had parameter value from Broda et al. Next, we developed industry-specific ratios for missing 
industries using the corresponding GTAP sector trade elasticities and the GTAP iron and steel 
                                                 
1 See Chapter 14 of the GTAP 7 Database Documentation for the full description of the parameters at 
https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/4184.pdf; see Table 14.2 for elasticities.  
2 Detailed documentation of the entire GTAP 7 Database is available at 
https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v7/v7_doco.asp. The GTAP also uses a unique system of 
categorizing commodities that does not match the NAICS or HS system exactly.

sector. We multiplied the resulting ratio by the Broda et al. iron and steel parameter (1.0). For 
example, the GTAP trade elasticity for coal (6.10) is approximately 2.2 times the trade elasticity 
for iron and steel (2.95). As a result, the multimarket import supply elasticity for coal is 
computed as 2.2 (2.2 x 1.0). 
A.2.2.4 Price Elasticity of Supply: United States 
We also used Broda et al.’s elasticities to derive a set of domestic supply elasticities for 
the model. We have assumed that a product’s domestic supply would be equal to or less elastic 
than other countries’ supply of imports. When we aggregated and averaged the original 
elasticities to the 3- and 4- digit NAICS level for our foreign supply elasticities, we also 
calculated the standard deviation of each 3- and 4-digit NAICS sample. By adding the standard 
deviation to the corresponding foreign supply and then taking the inverse, we were able to 
calculate a domestic supply elasticity for each sector that was lower than its foreign counterpart 
while maintaining the structure of the original elasticities. For sectors in which no standard 
deviation was available,1 we used professional judgment to apply the closest available substitute 
from a similar industry. Without a comparable way of scaling our foreign elasticities for the 
sectors in which we used the GTAP elasticities, we elected to keep the domestic and foreign 
supply elasticities the same. 
A.2.2.5 Demand 
Uses for industry output are divided into three groups: investment/government use, 
domestic intermediate uses, and other final use (domestic and exports). Given the short time 
horizon, investment/government does not change. Intermediate use is determined by the input 
use ratios and the industry output decisions. 
 ggii QQ   (A.7) 
iQ   = with-policy input demand quantity (i) 
gi  = input use ratio (g using input i) 
gQ  = with-policy output quantity (g) 
Other final use does respond to market price changes. Following guidance in the OAQPS 
economic resource manual (OAQPS, 1999), we use a general form for the U.S. industry demand 
function: 
                                                 
1 No standard deviations were calculated for the 3- and 4-digit codes that had only one observation (i.e., Broda et 
al.’s model used the exact 3- or 4-digit code). 
 A-22 
   ggg PaQ   (A.8) 
where 
gQ  = with-policy demand quantity (g) 
a  = calibrated scale parameter for the demand and price relationship 
gP  = with-policy price for output (g) 
g  = price elasticity of demand (g) 
The key parameter that controls consumption adjustments is the price elasticity of 
demand (ηg). To approximate the response, we use demand elasticities that were simulated with a 
general equilibrium model (Ho, Morgenstern, and Shih, 2008). Table A-6 reports the values 
currently available in the model. 
A.2.2.6 Model Scope 
The multimarket model includes 100 sectors covering energy, manufacturing, and service 
applications. Each sector’s production technology requires the purchase of energy and other 
intermediate goods made by other sectors included in the model. Linking the sectors in this 
manner allows the model to trace direct and indirect policy effects across different sectors. 
Therefore, it is best used when potential economic impacts and equity effects on related markets 
might be important to stakeholders not directly affected by an environmental policy. However, 
the model can also be run in single-market partial equilibrium mode to support and provide 
insights for other types of environmental policies. 
A.2.2.7 Model Time Horizon 
The model is designed to address short-run and transitional effects associated with 
environmental policy. Production technologies are fixed; the model does not assess substitution 
among production inputs (labor, energy intermediates, and other intermediates) and assumes 
each investment cannot be changed during the time frame of the analysis. These issues are better 
addressed using other frameworks such as computable general equilibrium modeling. Similarly, 
government purchases from each sector do not adjust in response to changes in goods/service 
prices. Although, employment levels (number of jobs) adjust as production levels change, wages 
are assumed to be fixed.

SUBJECT: Methodology for Estimating Cost and Emissions Impacts for Industrial, 
Commercial, Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters National Emission 
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants – Major Source 
 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this memorandum is to discuss the methodology used to estimate the 
costs, emission reductions, and secondary impacts from industrial, commercial, and institutional 
boilers at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). These impacts were calculated for 
existing units and new units projected to be operational by the year 2013, three years after the 
rule is expected to be promulgated. The results of the impacts analysis are presented for both the 
most stringent regulatory option evaluated and the regulatory option contained in the proposed 
rule. The development of the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor level of 
control, projection of new units, and a detailed description of the cost equations used to estimate 
costs for various control technologies is presented in other memoranda.1,2,3 This memorandum is 
organized as follows:

2.0 OVERVIEW OF REGULATORY OPTIONS 
Five control options were considered for existing boilers and process heaters at major 
sources of HAP. A description of the six options is included in this section. 
2.1 Existing Units 
 Option 1E represents the option where all boilers, regardless of fuel type or size, must 
meet PM, HCl, mercury, CO, and D/F numerical emission limits. 
 Option 2E uses the same control device and testing, and monitoring cost estimation logic 
outlined above for option 1E, except that it does not estimate ACI for units exceeding the 
MACT floor emission limit for dioxin/furan. Instead, it is estimated that most units, when 
testing for dioxin/furan will be below detection levels without installing any additional 
control devices. 
 Option 3E uses the same control device and testing, and monitoring cost estimation logic 
outlined above for option 4E below, but it does not include the cost of an annual energy 
audit. 
 Option 4E represents the primary proposed option discussed in the preamble. In this 
option all boilers and process equal to or greater than or equal to 10 mmBtu/hr must meet 
PM, HCl, mercury, CO, and D/F numerical emission limits, except for units in the natural 
gas/refinery gas and Metallurgical Process Furnace subcategories. All boilers and process 
heaters less than 10 mmBtu/hr must meet a work practice standard of a biennial boiler 
tune-up. All large units greater than or equal to 10 mmBtu/hr in the natural gas/refinery 
gas and Metallurgical Process Furnace subcategories must meet a work practice standard 
of an annual boiler tune-up. All major source facilities with a boiler or process heater 
must conduct an energy audit. 
 Option 5E uses the same control device and testing, and monitoring cot estimation logic 
outlined above for option 4E above for all units except for refinery gas units. Units firing 
refinery gas will have a separate numerical emission limit for mercury. 
 A revised definition of solid waste is being proposed parallel with this proposed 
rulemaking effort. The solid waste definitional rulemaking proposal includes both a 
primary and alternative definition of solid waste for consideration during the public 
comment period. Options 1E through 5E analyze the regulatory impacts with respect to 
the primary proposed definition of solid waste. However, to compare the impacts of both 
definitions of solid waste, the cost and emission impacts of regulatory option 4E 
discussed above were applied to the inventory of units that were not classified as waste 
burning units under the alternative solid waste definition. 
 C-3 
2.2 New Units 
Three control options were considered for existing boilers and process heaters at major 
sources of HAP. A description of the three options is included in this section. 
 Option 1N represents the option where all new boilers, regardless of fuel type or size, 
must meet PM, HCl, mercury, CO, and D/F numerical emission limits. 
 Option 2N uses the same control device and testing, and monitoring cost estimation logic 
outlined above for option 1N, except that it does not estimate ACI for units exceeding the 
MACT floor emission limit for dioxin/furan. Instead, it is estimated that most units, when 
testing for dioxin/furan will be below detection levels without installing any additional 
control devices. 
 Option 4N represents the primary proposed option discussed in the preamble. In this 
option all boilers and process, regardless of size, meet PM, HCl, mercury, CO, and D/F 
numerical emission limits, except for units in the natural gas/refinery gas and 
Metallurgical Process Furnace subcategories. All units in the natural gas/refinery gas and 
Metallurgical Process Furnace subcategories must meet a work practice standard of an 
annual boiler tune-up. 
3.0 ESTIMATING COST IMPACTS 
For each option, the cost impacts analysis compares the baseline emissions for each unit 
to the corresponding MACT floor emission limit for the unit’s subcategory. A control device was 
applied to the unit if its baseline emissions exceeded their applicable MACT floor emission limit. 
A comparison of the overall capital and annualized costs of the proposed options 4E and Option 
4N are presented in Table 1. The detailed equations used to estimate the control, testing, 
monitoring, and work practice costs are discussed in another memorandum.2 The following logic 
was used to apply control, testing, and monitoring costs to each boiler or process heater: 
3.1 Option 1E/1N 
Control Cost Impacts 
Mercury Control 
 A new fabric filter installation was expected to achieve the Hg emission limits in the 
proposed rule. Where baseline Hg emissions were found to be greater than the MACT 
floor, the cost of a fabric filter was estimated for an individual boiler or process heater, 
unless the unit already had a fabric filter installed. A new fabric filter was estimated to be 
installed at 12,138 existing boilers and process heaters. In the case of a unit with a fabric 
 C-4 
filter emitting Hg above the MACT floor emission limit, the incremental Hg removal 
efficiency required to meet the MACT floor was calculated, and then the costs to install 
activated carbon injection (ACI) technology on the boiler were estimated. If the unit had 
a packed bed scrubber and did not meet the MACT floor for Hg, a fabric filter was 
installed if no other control was in place. Incremental ACI equipment was installed for 
155 existing boilers and process heaters. 
 Wet scrubbers—the technology selected for the cost analysis to reduce emissions of 
hydrogen chloride (HCl)—are also capable of achieving modest reductions in Hg. 
Literature suggests that these scrubbers can achieve a 10-percent reduction in Hg 
emissions. If a scrubber was being installed for HCl, and baseline Hg emissions were 
within 10 percent of the MACT floor, the wet scrubber was expected to achieve this level 
of emission reduction without installing a fabric filter. 
Particulate Matter Control 
 When baseline particulate (PM) emissions exceeded the MACT floor, the cost of an ESP 
was estimated, unless a fabric filter had already been included in the cost analysis for Hg 
reduction. ESP technology was estimated to be installed at 397 existing boilers and 
process heaters. 
 Wet scrubbers are also capable of achieving a modest reduction in PM. Literature 
suggests that these scrubbers can achieve an 85-percent reduction in PM emissions. If a 
scrubber was being installed for HCl, and baseline PM emissions were within 85 percent 
of the MACT floor for PM, the wet scrubber was expected to achieve this level of 
emission reduction without installing an ESP. 
Hydrogen Chloride Control 
 When HCl baseline emissions were greater than the MACT floor, the cost of adding a 
packed bed scrubber was estimated. If the boiler already reported to have a scrubber 
installed and the baseline emissions still exceeded the floor, the incremental required HCl 
removal efficiency was calculated and the then the cost to increase the sorbent injection 
rate in the scrubber was estimated in the cost analysis. Wet scrubbers were identified to 
be necessary to control HCl emissions at 13,269 existing boilers and process heaters 
 C-5 
Dioxin/Furan Control 
 Where dioxin/furans exceeded the MACT floor, the required removal efficiencies of 
dioxin/furans was calculated, and the costs to install ACI were included in the cost 
analysis. If ACI had was previously included in the cost analysis for incremental Hg 
control, the ACI costs based on the highest required removal efficiency were used in the 
cost analysis. For example, if a boiler required 90 percent reduction in Hg and 98 percent 
reduction in dioxin/furan, the higher ACI costs associated with the 98 percent reduction 
of dioxin/furan were used in the cost analysis. ACI technology was estimated to be 
required at 2,538 existing boilers and process heaters for either Hg or dioxin/furan 
control. 
Carbon Monoxide and Organic HAP Control 
 Organic HAP and carbon monoxide can be controlled by either improving the 
combustion efficiency of the unit, or installing an oxidation catalyst on the exhaust of a 
combustion unit. The control strategy necessary to meet the MACT floor emission limit 
will vary depending on the magnitude between the baseline emissions and the CO MACT 
floor. A step function was used to delineate what type of control strategy should be 
analyzed in the cost impacts analysis: 
o Most boilers (other than Dutch ovens and PC-coal boilers discussed below) are 
designed to operate with CO emissions at or near 400 parts per million (ppm). A 
boiler tune-up, was estimated in the cost impacts analysis if the unit’s baseline 
emissions exceeded the floor for carbon monoxide (CO), but were less than or equal 
to 400 ppm @ 3% O2. 
o If the baseline CO emissions were between 400 and 1000 ppm @ 3% O2 for boilers 
and process heaters designed to burn liquid and gaseous fuels, the cost of a 
replacement low-NOx burner was estimated to achieve the MACT floor emission 
limits. 
o Since stokers, fuel cells, or fluidized bed unit do not have replaceable burners, a 
linkageless boiler management system (LBMS) was the technology estimated to 
achieve the MACT floor when baseline CO emissions exceeded the floor and were 
between 400 and 1000 ppm @ 3% O2. 
 C-6 
o For boilers and process heaters designed to burn gas and liquids, as well as stokers, 
fuel cells, and fluidized bed boilers and process heaters design to burn solid fuels, the 
cost impacts analysis estimated that a CO Oxidation catalyst would be required to 
meet MACT floor limits if a unit’s baseline CO emissions were above 1,000 ppm @ 
3% O2 and exceeded the MACT floor. 
o Similar to stokers, Dutch oven and suspension-fired boilers and process heaters do 
not have replaceable burners. The design of the Dutch oven/suspension burner 
combustion system and the high moisture content of the fuels used in Dutch ovens 
typically cause elevated CO levels compared to other combustor designs. A tune-up 
was estimated in the cost analysis for any Dutch oven/suspension burner with a 
baseline of less than 5,000 ppm @ 3% O2. LBMS costs were estimated for any Dutch 
oven boiler with baseline CO between 5,000 – 12,500 ppm @ 3% O2. If the baseline 
CO emissions at Dutch oven/suspension-fired units exceeded 12,500 ppm @ 3% O2, 
the cost of adding catalytic oxidation was estimated for the cost impacts analysis. 
o For PC-boilers, a tune-up was estimated in the cost analysis for any unit with a 
baseline of less than 1200 ppm @ 3% O2. The cost of a replacement LNB was 
estimated if CO emissions were between 1200 – 3000 ppm @ 3% O2 and catalytic 
oxidation was estimated if CO baseline was greater than 3000 ppm @ 3% O2. 
Option 1E of the cost impacts analysis estimated 11,013 existing boilers and process 
heaters would meet the CO MACT floor with a tune-up, an additional 1,073 existing units would 
install a LBMS, 1 existing boiler would replace their existing burner with a LNB, and 482 
existing units would install a CO oxidation catalyst. 
Testing and Monitoring Cost Impacts 
Testing and monitoring requirements varied depending on the equipment installed on the 
unit to control emissions, the design capacity of the unit, and the fuel category the unit was 
assigned to. 
Testing Costs 
All boilers and process heaters designed to burn solid and gaseous fuels were expected to 
conduct an annual compliance test for PM, HCl, Hg, D/F, and CO. The cost to conduct stack 
 C-7 
tests for these five pollutants was estimated to be $44,000 per year. Combustion units greater 
than 100 mmBtu/hr were expected to install CO CEMS in lieu of conducting a CO stack test and 
the cost to conduct tests on PM, HCl, Hg, and D/F was estimated to be $37,000 per year. 
Boilers and process heaters designed to burn liquid fuels were expected to conduct an 
annual compliance test for PM, D/F, and CO. In lieu of a stack test boilers designed to burn 
liquid fuels were expected to conduct fuel analysis, or report fuel analyses received from a fuel 
supplier for chlorine and Hg. Conducting stack tests for PM, D/F, and CO and fuel analysis for 
chlorine and Hg was estimated to be $16,000 per year. Combustion units greater than 100 
mmBtu/hr were expected to install CO CEMS in lieu of conducting a CO stack test and the cost 
to conduct tests on PM and D/F and fuel analysis for chlorine and Hg was estimated to be 
$10,000 per year. Although other fuels are eligible to comply with the proposed rule through fuel 
analysis in lieu of stack testing, this cost estimate conservatively assumed that only units 
designed to fire liquid fuels would use this compliance alternative. The methods and data sources 
used to estimate testing and monitoring costs are discussed in other memoranda.2 
Small boilers often exhaust to small diameter stacks that do not have any test ports or test 
platforms installed. For these small units, we estimated the additional costs to these costs to 
construct or rent scaffolding and install test ports. The costs include installation of 4 test ports, 90 
degrees opposed to each other, and five weeks rental of temporary scaffolding. EPA estimates 
that these small sources would incur an additional $185 million to install test ports and rent 
temporary scaffolding. Many establishments in each industry, commercial, or institutional sector 
are associated with multiple (as many as a 700) small units. A summary of the costs by fuel 
category is shown in Table 1 below.

Monitoring Costs 
Various monitor configurations were installed based on the size of the unit and the 
pollution control devices expected to be installed to achieve the MACT floor emission limits. For 
units expected to install packed bed wet scrubbers, an annualized cost of $5,600 for a scrubber 
parametric monitor was included in the cost analysis. For units expected to install a fabric filter, 
an annualized cost of $9,700 for a bag leak detection monitor was included in the cost analysis. 
If a unit was expected to install ACI, the cost to monitor the carbon injection rate was included in 
the analysis, based on the unit’s hours of operation. For units greater than 100 mmBtu/hr, an 
annualized cost of $53,300 for a CO CEMS was included in the cost analysis, and for units 
greater than 250 mmBtu/hr an annualized cost of $56,100 was used in the cost analysis. For units 
that did not install a PM CEMS and did not install a scrubber to meet HCl limits, an annualized 
cost of $14,660 for an opacity monitor was included in the cost analysis. No PM CEMS or 
opacity monitors were assumed for boilers and process heaters designed to gaseous fuels. 
Fuel Savings Impacts 
This cost analysis includes an estimate of energy savings for every unit that is expected to 
install controls to improve combustion, or conduct an annual tune-up or energy audit. The 
Department of Energy has conducted energy assessments at selected manufacturing facilities and 
reports that facilities can reduce fuel/energy use by 10 to 15 percent by using best practices to 
increase their energy efficiency. Many best practices are considered pollution prevention because 
they reduce the amount of fuel combusted which results in a corresponding reduction in 
 C-9 
emissions from the fuel combustion. Further boiler tune-ups have been shown to improve the 
efficiency of a boiler between 1 and 5 percent, depending on the age of the unit and the time 
lapse since the previous tune-up. Other combustion controls such as upgrading burners and 
installation of an LBMS are also expected to improve the efficiency of the unit, thus reducing 
fuel consumption. This cost analysis assumes an annual fuel savings of 1 percent. The energy 
savings is estimated using the Equation 1: 
Annual Fuel Savings (mmBtu/yr) = DC * CF * Ophours* EG (Equation 1) 
Where: 
DC = unit design capacity (mmBtu/hr) 
CF = capacity factor, 90% of design capacity 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
EG = Efficiency gain, estimated to be 1% 
After the fuel savings for each boiler and process heater was calculated, the both 
industrial and commercial prices for coal, #2 distillate fuel oil, #6 residual fuel oil, and natural 
gas were obtain from the EIA.3 The EIA data reported fuel prices as $/ton for coal, $/thousand 
cubic feet for natural gas, and cents per gallon for fuel oil. The higher heating values were 
obtained from Table C-1 of the EPA Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR part 98 subpart C) and 
the higher heating values were used to convert the fuel prices to a standard unit of measure, $ per 
mmBtu. Using the NAICS code reported by each facility and the fuel category assigned to each 
combustion unit, the appropriate fuel price was multiplied by the calculated fuel savings. This 
cost analysis only estimates the fuel savings from units in the coal, liquid and natural gas and 
other gaseous fuel categories. A fuel savings was not estimated for units in the biomass fuel 
category since the price of biomass fuels is variable, and often biomass is an on-site industrial 
byproduct instead of a purchased fuel. 
3.2 Option 2E/2N 
Option 2E uses the same control device and testing, and monitoring cost estimation logic 
outlined above for option 1E, except that it does not estimate ACI for units exceeding the MACT 
floor emission limit for dioxin/furan. Instead, it is estimated that most units, when testing for 
dioxin/furan will be below detection levels without installing any additional control devices. 
 C-10 
3.3 Option 3E 
Option 3E follows the same logic for estimating control costs as option 2E outlined 
above, with the exception of small units (less than 10 mmBtu/hr) and units in the natural 
gas/refinery gas and natural gas-fired metallurgical process furnace subcategories. In option 3E, 
the only cost estimated for small units is the cost of an annual tune-up for each boiler or process 
heater. For all units firing natural gas or refinery gas, regardless of the size of the unit, the only 
cost estimated is the cost of an annual tune-up for each boiler or process heater. 
Unlike option 2E, there are no testing and monitoring costs are associated with small 
units or units of any size designed to burn natural gas, refinery gas, or natural gas-fired 
metallurgical process furnaces. 
3.4 Option 4E 
Option 4E includes control device and testing/monitoring cost estimation logic identical 
to Option 3E outlined above, except for the addition of the estimated cost of one facility-wide 
energy audit for each facility, annualized over 5 years. As discussed in the memorandum for 
Estimating Control Costs from Major Source Boilers and Process Heaters, the cost of an energy 
audit ranges from $75,000 for industrial-scale energy audits to between $2,000 and $5,000 per 
energy audit for institutional and commercial-scale audits.2 The cost of each type of audit was 
annualized over 5 years at 7 percent to obtain an annualized cost estimate. For the cost impacts 
analysis, 1,608 facilities are expected to conduct an audit, 197 facilities are commercial or 
institutional and 1,411 facilities are industrial. 
3.5 Option 5E 
For refinery gas units, option 5E includes a cost estimate to install a carbon adsorption 
system to filter the refinery gas prior to combustion. Carbon adsorption is expected to remove 
trace contaminants in the gas, such as Hg. When this option was initially considered, the baseline 
emission factor for mercury from refinery gas units was estimated to be 1.07E-07 lb per mmBtu. 
Since that analysis was completed, the baseline emissions from refinery gas units were reviewed 
and an outlier from a 1990 test, on the order of 10-5 was identified to be biasing the baseline 
emission averages toward a higher average. This test occurred at Facility ID: CAExxonMobil-
Torrance (unit ID 75-F-1) and only one test run was available. Several additional mercury tests at 
other units firing refinery gas at the same facility in the same year were reported two be two 
 C-11 
orders of magnitude lower than the test reported for 75-F-1. After removing the outlier 
emissions, the baseline emissions of mercury from refinery gas were comparable to those of 
natural gas, and a combined average mercury baseline emission factor of 7.28E-07 lb/mmBtu 
was used for both refinery gas and natural gas. 
For analyzing the cost impacts of option 5E EPA estimated one carbon adsorption system 
for each facility with refinery gas boilers and process heaters. EPA expected that a centralized 
adsorption system would provide economies of scale and would treat all the gas prior to the 
refinery gas being used in the combustion equipment. The cost impacts assumption estimates that 
73 different facilities would install a carbon adsorption system to treat refinery gas. Since the 
revised estimate of mercury baseline emissions estimated from refinery gas units had decreased 
substantially as a result of adjusting the baseline emission factor, the cost to install carbon 
adsorption was no longer cost effective and the beyond the floor mercury control option from 
refinery gas units was not included in the proposal. However, the estimated costs of installing 
carbon adsorbers at refineries are included in Appendix A for reference. 
3.6 Option 4N 
Option 4N follows the same logic for estimating control costs as option 2E/2N outlined 
above, with the exception of units in the natural gas/refinery gas and natural gas-fired 
metallurgical process furnace subcategories. In option 4N, the only cost estimated for units firing 
natural gas or refinery gas, regardless of the size of the unit, the only cost estimated is the cost of 
an annual tune-up for each boiler or process heater. 
Unlike option 2E/2N, there are no testing and monitoring costs are associated units of any 
size designed to burn natural gas, refinery gas, or natural gas-fired metallurgical process 
furnaces. 
3.7 Impacts Considering the Alternative Solid Waste Definition 
The impacts of the alternative solid waste definition follows the identical logic for 
estimating control costs as option 4E discussed in Section 3.4 above. Under this option, there 
are13,275 boilers identified as not burning waste materials, compared to a total of 13,555 boilers 
and process heaters under the primary definition of solid waste. The remainders of these units are 
analyzed under the parallel rulemaking effort for Commercial Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators 
if the units are located in the private sector. Should the alternative definition of solid waste 
 C-12 
become the final promulgated definition, the additional waste burning units located in the public 
sector will be analyzed under the forthcoming Other Solid Waste Incinerator rulemaking. 
3.8 Summary of Cost Impacts 
Option 4E is the proposed option for existing boilers and process heaters and option 4N is 
the proposed option for new boilers and process heaters. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the costs of 
the proposed option for new and existing units. Appendix A of this memorandum provides a 
detailed summary of the costs according to boiler size, boiler fuel category, and individual 
control device costs. Appendix A also includes a summary of the costs on existing units under

4.0 METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING EMISSION 
REDUCTIONS 
This section discusses the methodology used to estimate emission reductions from boilers 
and process heaters at both existing and new facilities and it presents a summary of the results 
for the regulatory options 1E/1N and 4E/4N. 
4.1 Emission Reductions from Existing Boilers and Process Heaters 
The emission reductions analysis for existing combustion units was done for each boiler 
and process heater in the major source inventory. There are a total of 13,555 boilers and process 
heaters at major sources that reported data in the 2008 questionnaire (ICR No. 2286.01). Each 
combustion unit was assigned a unit-specific or average baseline emission factor, depending on 
the availability of emission data reported for the unit. A detailed discussion of the procedures and 
results of the baseline emissions analysis is presented in another memorandum.4 
Emission Reductions for Option 1E 
Emission reductions for PM, HCl, Hg, CO, and dioxins/furans were calculated on a ton 
per year basis by subtracting the baseline emissions assigned to each unit from the MACT floor 
emission limits corresponding to each unit’s subcategory. A detailed discussion of the 
procedures and results of the MACT floor analysis is presented in another memorandum.1 For 
each combustion unit, a percent reduction in CO was calculated. It was assumed that each 
combustion unit would achieve an identical percent reduction from baseline emissions for THC 
and VOC as was achieved for CO. Similarly, a percent reduction was also calculated for HCl. It 
was assumed that each combustion unit would achieve an identical percent reduction from 
baseline emissions for HF as was achieved for HCl. A combustion unit is required to install a 
scrubber for HCl control if it is not currently meeting the HCl floor limit, and if it doesn’t 
already have a scrubber installed. For units required to install a scrubber, it was assumed that the 
scrubber will achieve a 95 percent reduction from baseline for SO2. To calculate emission 
reductions for SO2, baseline emissions were multiplied by a factor of 0.95. A percent reduction 
in PM was calculated in order to estimate total metals reductions. It was assumed that each 
combustion unit would achieve an identical percent reduction from baseline emissions for each 
non-Hg metallic HAP as was achieved for PM. PM2.5 emissions were assumed to be a fraction 
 C-14 
of total filterable PM emissions based on fuel and control device configuration installed on the 
unit. The methods used to derive the contribution of PM2.5 to overall filterable PM are presented 
in other memoranda.4 To calculate emission reductions for PM2.5, the emission reductions for 
PM were multiplied by the applicable PM2.5 fraction. Emission reductions for all pollutants for 
which there was no floor value were calculated on a ton per year basis. 
To convert emission reductions from an emission rate on a heat input basis to an annual 
emission rate, Equation 2 was used: 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERHI * 0.0005 * Ophours (Equation 2) 
Where: 
ERHI = emission rate (lb/mmBtu) 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lbs per ton 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
To convert emission reductions from a concentration basis to an annual emission rate, 
Equations 3 and 4 were used: 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERC * 0.000001 * ρair * QS * 60 * Ophours * 0.0005 * 
(20.946 – O2) / (20.946 – Std O2) (Equation 3) 
Where: 
ERC = emission concentration (ppm @ 3% O2) 
0.000001 = conversion factor, ppm to parts 
ρair = density of air, 0.0749 lb/dscf 
QS = exhaust flowrate (dscfm) 
60 = conversion factor, minutes to hours 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lb per ton 
20.946 = percentage of oxygen in ambient air 
O2 = percentage of oxygen assumed in exhaust gas 
Std. O2 = 3 percent oxygen in standardized emission concentration for proposed rule. 
 C-15 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERC * 0.0283 * QS * 60 * Ophours * 0.000000001 * 0.0022 
* 0.0005 * (20.946 – O2) / (20.946 – Std O2) (Equation 4) 
Where: 
ERC = emission concentration (ng/dscm @ 7% O2) 
0.0283 = conversion factor, dry standard cubic meter per dry std. cubic foot 
QS = exhaust flowrate (dscfm) 
60 = conversion factor, minutes per hour 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
0.000000001 = conversion factor, ng to g 
0.0022 = conversion factor, g per lb 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lb per ton 
20.946 = percentage of oxygen in ambient air 
O2 = percentage of oxygen assumed in exhaust gas 
Std O2 = 7 percent oxygen in standardized emission concentration for proposed rule. 
Converting concentrations to an annual emission rate required an oxygen concentration 
and exhaust flowrate estimated for each specific fuel type. The development of these 
assumptions and estimates is presented in other memoranda.2 All conversions required the 
annual operating hours for each combustion unit reported in the 2008 survey. If no operating 
hours were reported, the unit was assumed to operate for 8,400 hours per year (two weeks of 
downtime). 
Emission Reductions for Option 4E 
The same calculations discussed for estimating emission reductions for option 1E were 
applied to all units except small units (less than 10 mmBtu/hr) and units of any size firing natural 
gas or refinery gas. For small units firing any type of fuel and units in the natural gas/refinery gas 
and natural gas metallurgical process furnace subcategories, the emission reductions were based 
on a one percent gain in efficiency expected from the annual tune-up work practice standard. 
Efficiency gains reduce fuel use, and in turn, emissions of hazardous air pollutants. A one 
percent reduction in all types of emissions was estimated by multiplying the baseline emissions 
for each unit by a factor of 0.01. 
Emission Reductions under the Alternative Solid Waste Definition 
The same calculations discussed for estimating emission reductions for option 4E were 
applied to all units that were identified as not burning waste under the alternative solid waste 
definition. In this case, the baseline emissions were compared to the MACT floor emission limits 
calculated for units not burning solid waste under the alternative definition. A discussion of the 
 C-16 
methodology used to calculate the MACT floor emission limits under the alternative solid waste 
definition is discussed in another memorandum.1 
Incremental Emission Reductions if Energy Audit Findings are Implemented 
We evaluated the potential additional reductions and fuel savings that could occur as a 
result of implementing certain cost-effective energy efficiency improvements identified during 
the audit. Using the Department of Energy references of a 10 to 15 percent improvement in 
efficiency, a range of incremental emission reductions was estimated considering efficiency 
gains between 5 and 10 percent. We applied the control efficiency ranges of 5 and 10 percent 
reduction to the emissions remaining after MACT level of controls were installed on the unit to 
identify the potential for additional emission reductions if the findings of an energy audit were 
implemented. Table 3 summarizes the potential additional emission reductions that could occur 
under a beyond the floor option of implementing any findings in the audit with a short term 
payback. The fuel savings were estimated using Equation 1 described in 3.1 of this memo was 
used to estimate fuel savings. In this case the efficiency gain term was modified to be between 5 
and 10 percent. 
A summary of the estimated emission reductions at existing units for options 1E, the 
proposed option 4E, as well as the reductions from units considering the alternative proposed 
solid waste definition are located in Appendix B.

4.2 Emission Reductions from New Boilers and Process Heaters 
Based on industrial and commercial fuel consumption projections from the EIA, there are 
46 new boilers and process heaters expected to come on-line by 2013.5 a discussion of the 
methodology used to project new boilers and process heaters is discussed in another 
memorandum.3 
The New Source Performance Standards for Industrial, Commercial and Institutional 
Boilers (40 CFR part 60, subparts Db, Dc) (NSPS), was reviewed to identify the expected 
baseline level of control for projected new units. It was determined that new boilers and process 
heaters larger than 30 mmBtu/hr and combusting biomass would install an ESP. This technology 
 C-18 
selection is based on the analysis used to establish the PM NSPS limit for biomass boilers. New 
coal units larger than 75 mmBtu/hr would have a fabric filter and wet scrubber installed, while 
coal new units between 30 and 75 mmBtu/hr would only have a fabric filter installed and would 
meet the SO2 limits in the NSPS by using coals with a low sulfur content. New units larger than 
30 mmBtu/hr and combusting liquid fuel would have a fabric filter installed. All new units less 
than 30 mmBtu/hr would have no add-on controls and liquid fuels were expected to meet the 
NSPS So2 limits using low sulfur fuel oils. Gas-fired units of all sizes were not expected to 
install controls to meet any of the NSPS limits. For this impacts analysis, it was assumed that all 
new solid fuel units would be stokers, since stoker boilers are the most common type of solid 
fuel boilers and all new units would have NOx control installed as a baseline control, regardless 
of fuel. 
Emission Reductions for Option 1N 
After an appropriate baseline level of control was determined for each model unit, an 
average baseline emission factor calculated for existing units within the same fuel category and 
having the same level of control was assigned to each model boiler. The NSPS specifies PM and 
SO2 limits for new solid- and liquid-fired combustion units based on heat input. It was assumed 
that all new solid and liquid units would be constructed to meet these limits, so they were used as 
baseline emission values where applicable. The baseline emissions for each unit were subtracted 
from the new source MACT floor emission limit corresponding to each unit’s subcategory. The 
same calculations discussed in Section 3.1 of this memo were used to estimate the reductions for 
new units. 
Emission Reductions for Option 4N 
Similar to the methods discussed in Section 4.1 of this memorandum, the emission 
reductions for new units under regulatory option 4N were calculated by subtracting the baseline 
emissions assigned to each unit from the MACT floor emission limits corresponding to each 
unit’s subcategory, except for units firing natural gas or refinery gas. For any size natural gas or 
refinery gas-fired units, the emission reductions were estimated base on a 1 percent reduction in 
emissions, as a result of implementing a tune-up work practice. A summary of the estimated 
emission reductions at existing units for both option 1 and option 4 are located in Appendix B-1. 
 C-19 
5.0 SECONDARY IMPACTS 
Secondary impacts include the solid waste, water, wastewater, and electricity required to 
operate air pollution control devices, as well as the additional energy savings resulting from 
improved combustion controls or work practices required by the NESHAP. This section 
documents the inputs and equations used to estimate these secondary impacts, and it summarizes 
the impacts at existing units under proposed regulatory option 4 and new units under proposed 
regulatory option 1. Table 4-1 summarizes the cost, emission, and secondary impacts of this 
proposed NESHAP. Appendices C-1 and C-2 present a detailed breakdown of the secondary 
waste, water, and energy impacts from each subcategory of new and existing boilers and process 
heaters, respectively. 
Table 4-1. Summary of Secondary Impacts 
Impact New Units 
(proposed regulatory Option 4N) 
Existing Units 
(proposed regulatory Option 4E) 
Water (gal/yr) 197,200 2.4 billion
Wastewater (gal/yr) 142,300 730 million
Solid Waste (tons/yr) 149,800 81,400
Purchased Electricity (kW-hr/yr) 11.2 2.9 billion
Energy Savings* (trillion Btu/yr) 0.1 41.7
* Energy savings is calculated for units in the coal, liquid and gas subcategories. 
The secondary impacts were calculated using algorithms and assumptions described in 
another memorandum.2 These algorithms and assumptions were applied to the existing boiler 
and process heaters, where the baseline emissions for each unit exceeded the proposed MACT 
floor emission limit except for small units (<10 mmBtu/hr) and units firing natural gas or 
refinery gas. A one percent energy savings was calculated for all units, including the small and 
gas-fired units since these units are expected to conduct a tune-up. For new units, the algorithms 
and assumptions were applied to model units representing units expected to come online between 
2010 and 2013, when the baseline emissions for each model exceeded the proposed MACT floor 
emission limit for new units except for units firing natural gas and refinery gas. Natural gas and 
refinery gas are not required to meet a numerical emission limit, and therefore not expected to 
 C-20 
incur any secondary waste, water, or electricity impacts from these controls. A 1 percent energy 
savings from natural gas and refinery gas units are included in the energy savings estimate in 
Table 4-1 since these units are expected to conduct a tune-up. The methodology used to assign 
baseline emission factors to new and existing units are discussed in another memorandum.4 
5.1 Wastewater and Water Impacts 
The water required to create a slurry in the packed scrubber and the wastewater generated 
by the effluent of a packed bed scrubber was calculated for every unit expected to install a 
scrubber to meet the HCl limits in the proposed rule. Both the water and wastewater calculations 
required the use of several constants and variables. The constants including the density of gas, 
moles of salt needed per mole of hydrogen chloride in the exhaust gas, the molecular weight of 
the salt used, the fraction of the waste stream treated, operating hours per year and the molecular 
weight of the gas. The data sources for these constants are provided in another memorandum.2 
The variables used to estimate the quantity of water required and wastewater generated were 
calculated based on characteristics reported for each existing unit in the 2008 survey and for the 
characteristics assigned to each new model unit. The variables included: exhaust flow rate from 
the combustion unit to the control device in actual cubic feet per minute, the inlet loading of 
hydrogen chloride to the control device (mole fraction), and the efficiency of the control device 
in removing hydrogen chloride from the exhaust gas (percent reduction). The calculations used 
to estimate each variable are provided in another memorandum.2 The total national water and 
wastewater amounts in Table 4.1 were determined by adding the per unit water and wastewater 
estimates for all new and existing units, respectively. 
5.2 Solid Waste Impacts 
Solid waste is generated from collecting dust and fly ash in fabric filters or ESP control 
devices, spent carbon associated with ACI or the installation of a carbon bed adsorber, or spent 
caustic from increasing the caustic injection rate. Solid waste impacts were estimated for every 
unit expected to install a fabric filter, ACI or carbon bed adsorber to meet mercury emission 
limits, or install an ESP to meet PM emission limits. The total national solid waste amounts in 
Table 4.1 were determined by adding the per unit solid waste estimates for all new and existing 
units, respectively. To estimate the solid waste contribution from each of these control devices, 
the variables were calculated based on characteristics reported for each existing unit in the 2008 
 C-21 
survey and for the characteristics assigned to each new model unit. The calculations used to 
estimate each variable and the quantity of solid waste generated are provided in another 
memorandum.2 
The solid waste (dust, fly ash) generated by the use of an electrostatic precipitator was 
calculated when an electrostatic precipitator was determined to be necessary to meet the 
NESHAP emission limits for PM. Estimates of the solid waste collected in an ESP was based on 
several variables including: exhaust flow rate from the combustion unit to the control device 
(acfm); the inlet loading of particulate matter to the control device (gr/acfm); operating hours 
(hr/year) and the efficiency of the control device required to meet the PM emission limits in the 
proposed NESHAP. 
The solid waste generated from the collection of dust and fly ash in a fabric filter was 
calculated when a fabric filter was determined to be necessary to meet the proposed NESHAP 
emission limits for particulate matter and/or mercury. The calculation required the use of three 
variables, including: exhaust flow rate from the combustion unit to the control device (dscfm); 
operating hours (hr/year) and the inlet loading of particulate matter to the control device 
(gr/acfm). 
For this analysis, the spent carbon collected from units with ACI is assumed to be 
disposed of instead of being re-generated. The amount of spent carbon created from ACI was 
calculated when ACI was expected to be necessary to meet the proposed NESHAP emission 
limits for mercury or dioxin/furan. The calculation required the use of six variables, including: 
exhaust flow rate from the combustion unit to the control device (dscfm); operating hours 
(hr/year), required removal efficiency for mercury and dioxin/furan, and an adjustment factor 
based required removal efficiency of mercury or dioxin /furan. 
The solid waste generated by the use of increased caustic was calculated for those units 
where additional caustic was expected to achieve the proposed NESHAP emission limits for 
HCl. The calculation required the use of three variables, including: exhaust flow rate from the 
combustion unit to the control device (dscfm); operating hours (hr/year), and the required 
removal efficiency for HCl. 
 C-22 
5.3 Electricity Impacts 
The amount of electricity required to operate a control device was calculated for a packed 
scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, and fabric filter, CO oxidation catalyst and the fans for the 
ductwork associated with this equipment. These impacts were assessed for every unit that was 
estimated to require hydrogen chloride and/or particulate matter control. Electricity requirements 
are one output of the cost algorithms used in the analyses, so no additional calculations were 
necessary. For some units, an electrical demand from multiple control devices was estimated. 
The total national electricity demand in Table 4.1 was determined by adding the per unit solid 
waste estimates for all new and existing units, respectively. To estimate the electricity demand 
from each of these control devices, a set of variables were calculated based on characteristics 
reported for each existing unit in the 2008 survey and for the characteristics assigned to each new 
model unit. The constants, variables, and calculations used to estimate each variable and the 
electricity demand to operate the control devices are provided in another memorandum.2 
5.4 Energy Savings Impacts 
The energy savings from combustion controls such as low NOx burners or linkageless 
boiler management systems, and work practice standards, including a tune-up, and implementing 
the energy audit findings with a short-term payback can improvements in efficiency, thereby 
reducing fuel consumption. Although these combustion improvements have been documented to 
achieve efficiency gains between 5 and 10 percent from the baseline operating conditions, this 
secondary impacts analysis estimates a 1 percent efficiency gain, to be conservative and 
consistent with the assumptions made in Section 3.1 of this memorandum. Quantifying the exact 
gains in efficiency from each of these work practice standards is difficult, and may depend on the 
baseline operating efficiency of each unit. 
Section 3.1 discusses the fuel savings impacts in terms of annualized cost savings to each 
boiler or process heater, and the national energy savings presented in Table 4.1 of this section 
follows the same methodology as was discussed in Section 3.1 and reflect the savings from 
boilers in the coal, gas, and liquid fuel categories only. 
5.5 Estimating Secondary Impacts for Regulatory Options 4E/4N 
Regulatory Options 4E for existing and 4N for new units are both described in detail in 
Section 3 of this memorandum. For the secondary impacts analysis at existing units under option 
 C-23 
4E, the water, wastewater, solid waste, and electricity impacts were only assessed for large units, 
(those greater than or equal to 10 mmBtu/hr) that are in the coal, biomass, liquids, or other 
process gas subcategories. Secondary impacts of water, wastewater, solid waste, and electricity 
were not assessed for natural gas or refinery gas units or units in the natural gas metallurgical 
process furnace subcategory. Energy savings were estimated for all units firing anything other 
than biomass since all units were expected to conduct an energy audit. 
For new units under option 4N, the water, wastewater, solid waste, and electricity 
impacts were assessed for any size unit firing coal, biomass, liquid, or other process gases. 
Secondary impacts of water, wastewater, solid waste, and electricity were not assessed for 
natural gas or refinery gas units or units in the natural gas metallurgical process furnace 
subcategory. A one percent energy savings was estimated for all units firing coal, liquids or 
gases that were estimated to require a tune-up or the installation of combustion control 
equipment to meet the CO limits from new boilers. Both tune-ups and combustion controls 
improve the efficiency of the unit, thereby reducing energy consumption.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this memorandum is to discuss the methodology used to estimate the 
costs, emission reductions, and secondary impacts from industrial, commercial, and institutional 
boilers at area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). These impacts were calculated for 
existing units and new units projected to be operational by the year 2013, three years after the 
rule is expected to be promulgated. The results of the impacts analysis are presented for both the 
most stringent regulatory option evaluated and the regulatory option contained in the proposed 
rule. The development of the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor and 
Generally Achievable Control Technology (GACT) level of control, projection of new units, and 
a detailed description of the cost equations used to estimate costs for various control technologies 
is presented in other memoranda.1,2,3 This memorandum is organized as follows:

2.0 OVERVIEW OF REGULATORY OPTIONS 
Three control options were considered for existing boilers at area sources of HAP. A 
description of the three options is described below.  
2.1 Existing Units 
 Option 1E represents the option where all boilers, regardless of fuel type or size, must 
meet mercury and CO numerical emission limits based on MACT and PM numerical 
emission limits based on GACT. PM GACT was identified to be a multiclone for existing 
units. 
 Option 2E represents the same emission limits as discussed in 1E above for large units 
(equal to or greater than 10 mmBtu/hr). Small units are exempt from numerical limits and 
instead are required to meet a work practice standard of a biennial tune-up. All facilities 
are required to conduct an energy audit. 
 Option 3E represents the primary proposed option discussed in the preamble. In this 
option, all coal boilers equal to or greater than 10 mmBtu/hr must meet mercury and CO 
numeric emission limits based on MACT. All biomass and liquid boilers equal to or 
greater than 10 mmBtu/hr must meet a CO numerical emission limit, based on MACT. 
All facilities with a large boiler are required to conduct an energy audit. Small boilers are 
exempt from numeric emission limits for all pollutants, but are required to meet a work 
practice standard of a biennial tune-up. There are no numerical emission limits for PM 
under this option for any size or type of unit. 
2.2 New Units 
Three control options were considered for new boilers at area sources of HAP. A detailed 
description of the three options is described below. 
 Option 1N represents the option where all boilers, regardless of fuel type or size, must 
meet mercury and CO limits based on MACT and PM numerical emission limits based 
on GACT. GACT for new units is based on PM limits in the New Source Performance 
Standards (NSPS) for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers (40 CFR part 60 
subparts Db, Dc). 
 Option 2N represents the same emission limits as discussed in 1N above for large units 
(equal to or greater than 10 mmBtu/hr). Small units are exempt from numerical emission 
limits and instead are required to meet a work practice standard of a biennial tune-up.  
 Option 3N represents the primary proposed option discussed in the preamble. In this 
option, all coal boilers, regardless of size, must meet mercury and CO limits based on 
MACT and PM numerical emission limits based on GACT. All biomass and liquid 
 D-3 
boilers, regardless of size, must meet CO limits based on MACT and PM numerical 
emission limits based on GACT. 
3.0 ESTIMATING COST IMPACTS 
For each option, a percentage of units in each model unit were assumed to require control 
devices in order to meet the limit when the baseline emissions for the model unit exceeded the 
MACT floor emission limit applicable to each model. A detailed description of the three options 
is described below. A summary table comparing the overall capital and annualized costs of 
option 3E for existing units and option 3N for new units is presented in Table 1. The equations 
used to estimate the control, testing, monitoring, and work practice costs are discussed in another 
memorandum.3 The following logic was used to apply control, testing, and monitoring costs to 
each boiler: 
3.1 Option 1E 
Control Cost Impacts 
Mercury Control 
A new fabric filter installation was expected to achieve the mercury emission limits in the 
proposed rule. Where baseline mercury emissions were found to be greater than the MACT floor, 
the cost of a fabric filter was estimated for a portion of the boilers represented by the model unit. 
Based on the data used in the MACT floor analysis, a fraction of units in each subcategory 
meeting the MACT floor for Hg was estimated. For boilers designed to burn biomass one of the 
boilers was meeting the floor and the other unit was not meeting the floor. In the cost impacts 
analysis, 50 percent of the biomass units were estimated to install a fabric filter to meet the floor. 
For boilers designed to burn coal, 44 percent of units were achieving the proposed MACT floor 
emission limit for coal, so a new fabric filter was estimated to be installed at 56 percent of the 
existing coal-fired boilers. For liquid fuel units, there were no area source boilers with emission 
test data available for mercury. In the absence of other information about the distribution of units 
that would require a fabric filter to be installed, this cost impacts analysis assumes that 50 
percent of the liquid fuel units would install a fabric filter to meet the mercury limit.  
 D-4 
CO/Organic HAP Control 
Organic HAP and carbon monoxide can be controlled by either improving the 
combustion efficiency of the unit, or installing an oxidation catalyst on the exhaust of a 
combustion unit. The control strategy necessary to meet the MACT floor emission limit will vary 
depending on the magnitude between the baseline emissions and the CO MACT floor.  
Most boilers (other than Dutch ovens and PC-coal boilers) are designed to operate with 
CO emissions at or near 400 parts per million (ppm). A boiler tune-up was estimated in the cost 
impacts analysis if the unit’s baseline emissions exceeded the floor for carbon monoxide (CO), 
but were less than or equal to 400 ppm @ 3% O2. The combustor design of the boilers in the area 
source inventory is not known and this impacts analysis assumes that all areas source boilers 
firing solid fuels have a stoker combustor design since this is the predominant combustor design 
in the major source boiler inventory. The baseline emissions for area source boilers in all fuel 
categories are less than 400 ppm, and so it is assumed that combustion controls, either a basic 
tune-up or a more advanced burner replacement or installation of a linkageless boiler 
management system, can achieve the proposed MACT floor emission limits. No oxidation 
catalysts are estimated to be required to meet the MACT floor emission limits. 
Based on the emission test data used to calculate the MACT floor for CO, 29 percent of 
units burning coal are meeting the MACT floor and these units would be expected to install a 
linkageless boiler management system to comply with the CO limits. For units burning biomass, 
72 percent of the units are exceeding the MACT floor emission limits, and so 72 percent of the 
units are estimated to install a linkageless boiler management system. For units burning liquids, 
86 percent of the units are exceeding the floor and this cost impacts analysis assumes these units 
will install a new low NOx replacement burner in order to meet the CO limits. The units not 
expected to install these advanced controls are expected to conduct an annual tune-up to maintain 
in compliance with the proposed CO limit overtime. 
Particulate Matter Control 
For all units that were not expected to install a fabric filter for mercury control, the cost 
impacts analysis for this option assumes that the unit would install a multiclone to achieve the 
GACT emission limits for PM. Based on the current MACT floor analysis, 44 percent of coal 
units and 50 percent of liquid units would install a multiclone. Existing biomass units not 
 D-5 
expected to install a fabric filter would also install a multiclone. Base on the current MACT floor 
analysis, 50 percent of existing biomass units would install a multiclone.  
Testing and Monitoring Cost Impacts 
Testing and monitoring requirements varied depending on the equipment installed on the 
unit to control emissions, the design capacity of the model unit, and the fuel category of the 
model unit. 
Testing Costs 
All boilers designed to burn solid fuels were expected to conduct an annual compliance 
test for PM, Hg, and CO. The cost to conduct stack tests for these three pollutants was estimated 
to be $15,000 per year. Boilers greater than 100 mmBtu/hr were expected to install CO CEMS in 
lieu of conducting a CO stack test and the cost to conduct tests on PM and Hg was estimated to 
be $12,000 per year.  
Boilers designed to burn liquid fuels were expected to conduct an annual compliance test 
for PM and CO. In lieu of a stack test boilers designed to burn liquid fuels were expected to 
conduct fuel analysis, or report fuel analyses received from a fuel supplier for chlorine and Hg. 
Conducting stack tests for PM and CO was estimated to be $13,000 per year and the cost to 
conduct fuel analysis for Hg was estimated to be $600 per year. Combustion units greater than 
100 mmBtu/hr were expected to install CO CEMS in lieu of conducting a CO stack test and the 
cost to conduct tests on PM and fuel analysis for Hg was estimated to be $8,600 per year. 
Although solid fuels are eligible to comply with the proposed rule through fuel analysis in lieu of 
stack testing, when the mercury content of the fuel is below the MACT floor emission limit, this 
cost estimate conservatively assumed that only units designed to fire liquid fuels would use this 
compliance alternative. The methods and data sources used to estimate testing and monitoring 
costs are discussed in other memoranda.3 
Monitoring Costs 
Various monitor configurations were installed based on the size of the unit and the 
pollution control devices expected to be installed to achieve the MACT floor emission limits. For 
units expected to install a fabric filter, an annualized cost of $9,700 for a bag leak detection 
monitor was included in the cost analysis. For units greater than 100 mmBtu/hr, an annualized 
 D-6 
cost of $53,300 for a CO CEMS was included in the cost analysis. For units that did not install a 
bag leak detector, an annualized cost of $14,660 for an opacity monitor was included in the cost 
analysis.  
Fuel Savings Impacts 
This cost analysis includes an estimate of energy savings for every unit that is expected to 
install controls to improve combustion, or conduct an annual tune-up or energy audit. The 
Department of Energy has conducted energy assessments at selected manufacturing facilities and 
reports that facilities can reduce fuel/energy use by 10 to 15 percent by using best practices to 
increase their energy efficiency. Many best practices are considered pollution prevention because 
they reduce the amount of fuel combusted which results in a corresponding reduction in 
emissions from the fuel combustion. Further boiler tune-ups have been shown to improve the 
efficiency of a boiler between 1 and 5 percent, depending on the age of the unit and the time 
lapse since the previous tune-up. Other combustion controls such as upgrading burners and 
installation of an LBMS are also expected to improve the efficiency of the unit, thus reducing 
fuel consumption. This cost analysis assumes an annual fuel savings of 1 percent. The energy 
savings is estimated using Equation 1: 
Annual Fuel Savings (mmBtu/yr) = DC * CF * Ophours * EG (Equation 1) 
Where: 
DC = unit design capacity (mmBtu/hr) 
Ophours = annual operating hours, assumed 8400 (hours/year) 
EG = Efficiency gain, estimated to be 1% 
CF = annual average capacity factor, 0.5 for liquid and 0.65 for coal and biomass 
After the fuel savings for each boiler was calculated, the both industrial and commercial 
prices for coal, #2 distillate fuel oil, and #6 residual fuel oil were obtained from the EIA.3 The 
EIA data reported fuel prices as $/ton for coal, and cents per gallon for fuel oil. The higher 
heating values were obtained from Table C-1 of the EPA Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR 
part 98 subpart C) and the higher heating values were used to convert the fuel prices to a 
standard unit of measure, $ per mmBtu. Using the distribution of SIC codes reported in the 13-
state boiler inspector inventory, the model units were distributed to an industrial or commercial 
sector, and then the appropriate fuel price was multiplied by the calculated fuel savings. This 
cost analysis only estimates the fuel savings from units in the coal and liquid fuel categories. A 
 D-7 
fuel savings was not estimated for units in the biomass fuel category since the price of biomass 
fuels is variable, and often biomass is an on-site industrial byproduct instead of a purchased fuel. 
3.2 Option 2E 
Option 2E follows the same logic for estimating control costs as option 1E outlined 
above, with the exception of small units (less than 10 mmBtu/hr). In option 2E, the only cost 
estimated for small units is the cost of an annual tune-up for each boiler. No testing and 
monitoring costs were included in option 2E for small units. Option 2E also includes the cost of 
an energy audit at every area source facility, approximately 91,339 facilities. As discussed in the 
memorandum for Estimating Control Costs from Major Source Boilers and Process heaters, the 
cost of an energy audit ranges from $75,000 for industrial-scale energy audits to between $2,000 
and $5,000 per energy audit for institutional and commercial-scale audits.4 The facility’s 
classification of either an industrial or commercial facility was assigned using the distribution of 
SIC codes in the 13-state boiler inspector inventory. The cost of each type of audit was 
annualized over 5 years at 7 percent to obtain an annualized cost estimate.  
3.3 Option 3E 
The proposed option 3E includes control device and testing/monitoring cost estimation 
for mercury and CO from large coal units. As mentioned in option 1E, 56 percent of large coal 
units, or 321 boilers are expected to install a fabric filter in order to meet the mercury limit. In 
addition, 29 percent of large coal units are expected to install advanced combustion controls in 
order to meet the CO limit. This analysis uses the cost of a linkageless boiler management 
system to estimate the costs of advanced combustion control. The remaining 71 percent of large 
coal units are expected to meet the CO limit with a tune-up. The testing and monitoring costs for 
large coal units include a test for CO and mercury, as well as a bag leak detection system for the 
321 boilers that are expected to install a fabric filter. There are no proposed numerical PM 
emission limits under this option, and so no additional testing costs for PM or opacity monitoring 
costs were assessed in the cost impacts analysis for this option. 
Under option 3E liquid and biomass boilers are not subject to numerical emission limits 
for mercury and there are no costs included in the impacts analysis to install fabric filters or 
conduct mercury fuel analysis or stack testing. Large liquid and biomass boilers are subject to 
numerical emission limits for CO. This cost impacts analysis estimates that all the biomass and 
 D-8 
liquid fuel units can meet the CO emission limits by conducting an annual tune-up. These large 
units must also conduct testing and monitoring activities for CO to demonstrate compliance with 
the numerical emission limits. 
Option 3E exempts small boilers from numerical emission limits. Instead these units must 
conduct a work practice standard of a biennial tune-up. The cost impacts analysis does not 
include any additional testing and monitoring requirements for these small boilers. 
Finally, option 3E proposes that all facilities with large boilers conduct an energy audit. 
For this cost impacts analysis one large boiler per facility was assumed, or 13,268 facilities 
estimated to conduct an audit. Similar to the discussion under option 2E, the cost of the audit 
ranged from $75,000 for industrial-scale energy audits to between $2,000 and $5,000 per energy 
audit for institutional and commercial-scale audits.2  
3.4 Option 1N 
New area source boilers are subject to an NSPS (40 CFR part 60 subparts Db, Dc) to 
regulate emissions of PM, NOx and SO2. The cost impacts analysis considered controls that 
would likely be installed to comply with the NSPS and includes an estimate of any additional 
control, testing and monitoring costs that would not be already conducted to meet the 
requirements of the NSPS. Based on a review of the NSPS, this analysis assumes all biomass 
boilers greater than 30 mmBtu/hr will have an ESP control installed as the baseline to meet the 
NSPS PM limits; all coal boilers greater than 75 will have an FF and wet scrubber installed to 
meet PM and SO2 limits; all coal boilers between 30 and 75 will have a Fabric Filter and use low 
sulfur coal to meet PM and SO2 limits, and all liquid boilers greater than 30 will have an FF 
installed to meet PM limits. The NSPS does not regulate PM for units less than 30 mmBtu/hr.  
Mercury Control 
A new fabric filter installation was expected to achieve the mercury emission limits in the 
proposed rule. Where baseline mercury emissions were found to be greater than the MACT floor, 
the cost of a fabric filter was estimated for a portion of the boilers represented by the model unit. 
All new boilers, regardless of size or fuel, were expected to install a fabric filter in order to meet 
the mercury limits under this option. Comparing these mercury control requirement to the 
expected controls under the NSPS, all biomass boilers are expected to install a fabric filter to 
 D-9 
meet the mercury limit and all liquid and coal boilers less than or equal to 30 mmBtu/hr are 
expected to install a fabric filter to meet the mercury limit. 
CO/Organic HAP Control 
New boilers are expected to be equipped with new and efficient burners, and it was 
assumed that an annual tune-up could achieve the CO numeric emission limit for all sizes and 
types of boilers. Other advanced combustion controls were not considered as a control alternative 
for new boilers. As mentioned under 1E, the control strategy necessary to meet the MACT floor 
emission limit will vary depending on the magnitude between the baseline emissions and the CO 
MACT floor.  
Particulate Matter Control 
Under this option all units are expected to install a fabric filter for mercury control, which 
has a co-benefit of reducing PM emissions, as well as other non-mercury metallic HAP. No 
additional control costs were estimated for PM control at new boilers. 
Testing and Monitoring Cost Impacts 
Testing and monitoring requirements varied depending on the equipment installed on the 
unit to control emissions, the design capacity of the model unit, and the fuel category of the 
model unit.  
Testing Costs 
All boilers designed to burn solid fuels were expected to conduct an annual compliance 
test for PM, Hg, and CO. The cost to conduct stack tests for these three pollutants was estimated 
to be $15,000 per year. Combustion units greater than 100 mmBtu/hr were expected to install 
CO CEMS in lieu of conducting a CO stack test and the cost to conduct tests on PM and Hg was 
estimated to be $12,000 per year.  
Boilers designed to burn liquid fuels were expected to conduct an annual compliance test 
for PM and CO. In lieu of a stack test boilers designed to burn liquid fuels were expected to 
conduct fuel analysis, or report fuel analyses received from a fuel supplier for chlorine and Hg. 
Conducting stack tests for PM and CO was estimated to be $13,000 per year and the cost to 
conduct fuel analysis for Hg was estimated to be $600 per year. Combustion units greater than 
100 mmBtu/hr were expected to install CO CEMS in lieu of conducting a CO stack test and the 
 D-10 
cost to conduct tests on PM and fuel analysis for Hg was estimated to be $8,600 per year. 
Although solid fuels are eligible to comply with the proposed rule through fuel analysis in lieu of 
stack testing, when the mercury content of the fuel is below the MACT floor emission limit, this 
cost estimate conservatively assumed that only units designed to fire liquid fuels would use this 
compliance alternative. The methods and data sources used to estimate testing and monitoring 
costs are discussed in other memoranda.3 
Monitoring Costs 
Various monitor configurations were installed based on the size of the unit and the 
pollution control devices expected to be installed to achieve the MACT floor emission limits. For 
units expected to install a fabric filter, an annualized cost of $9,700 for a bag leak detection 
monitor was included in the cost analysis. For units greater than 100 mmBtu/hr, an annualized 
cost of $53,300 for a CO CEMS was included in the cost analysis. For units that did not install a 
bag leak detector, an annualized cost of $14,660 for an opacity monitor was included in the cost 
analysis.  
3.5 Option 2N 
Option 2N follows the same logic for estimating control costs as option 1N outlined 
above, with the exception of small units (less than 10 mmBtu/hr). In option 2N, the only cost 
estimated for small units is the cost of an annual tune-up for each boiler. No testing and 
monitoring costs were included in option 2N for small units  
3.6 Option 3N 
The proposed option 3N includes identical requirement for coal units as outlined under 
option 1N. Under option 3N liquid and biomass boilers are not subject to numerical emission 
limits for mercury and there are no costs included in the impacts analysis to install fabric filters 
for mercury control or conduct mercury fuel analysis or stack testing. Liquid and biomass boilers 
are subject to numerical emission limits for CO. This cost impacts analysis estimates that all the 
biomass and liquid fuel units can meet the CO emission limits by conducting an annual tune-up. 
These units must also conduct testing and monitoring activities for CO to demonstrate 
compliance with the numerical emission limits. 
 D-11 
Option 3N also includes a numerical PM emission limit for coal, biomass, and liquid 
boilers, based on the NSPS limits applicable to each of these categories. Since all coal units are 
subject to mercury emission limits, they are expected to meet a PM GACT limit of 0.051 
lb/mmBtu without any additional control requirements. The NSPS PM limit for biomass is 0.1 
lb/mmBtu, which is based on the performance of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Since 
biomass units greater than 30 mmBtu/hr are already subject to this limit under the NSPS, this 
cost analysis applies the costs for an ESP to units less than or equal to 30 mmBtu/hr. The NSPS 
PM limit for liquids is also 0.051 lb/mmBtu. Based on the calculated average baseline emission 
factors analysis distillate liquids are expected to meet that limit without any additional control.5 
However residual liquid units are expected to install a fabric filter to meet the PM emission limit. 
Under option 3N, all boilers less than or equal to 30 mmBtu/hr are estimated to incur 
costs to test for PM and CO, at an estimate cost of $14,000 per year. Boilers greater than 30 
mmBtu/hr will incur PM stack testing costs under the NSPS. Coal boilers are estimated to incur 
additional costs to test for mercury and the cost to conduct tests for PM, CO, and Hg is estimated 
to be $19,000 per year.  
3.7 Summary of Cost Impacts 
Option 3E is the proposed option for existing boilers and option 3N is the proposed 
option for new boilers. Since new boilers and their exhaust stacks can be designed to allow for 
stack testing, the tune-up work practice standard does not apply to new small units. Table 1 
summarizes the costs of the proposed option for new and existing boilers at area sources of HAP. 
Appendix A of this memorandum provides a detailed summary of the costs for each model unit.

4.0 METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING EMISSION 
REDUCTIONS 
This section discusses the methodology used to estimate emission reductions from boilers 
at both existing and new facilities and it presents a summary of the results for the regulatory 
options 1E/1N and 3E/3N. 
4.1 Emission Reductions from Existing Boilers 
Each model area source boiler was assigned baseline emissions based on the calculated 
baseline averages for existing major source combustion units in the same size and fuel 
subcategory. The development of area source model units and the procedures and results of the 
baseline emissions analysis is presented in other memoranda.5-6 
Emission Reductions for Option 1E 
Emission reductions for all pollutants were calculated on a ton per year basis. Emission 
reductions of Hg and CO were calculated by subtracting the baseline emissions assigned to each 
model unit from the MACT floor (or GACT) emission limits corresponding to the subcategory 
for each model boiler. A detailed discussion of the procedures and results of the MACT floor 
analysis is presented in another memorandum.1 
For all units expected to install a fabric filter to meet the mercury MACT floor emission 
limits, this fabric filter achieves a co-benefit of reducing emissions of PM and non-mercury 
metallic HAP. To calculate the PM emission reductions from units expected to install a fabric 
filter, the baseline emissions assigned to each model boiler were subtracted from the calculated 
average baseline emission factor corresponding to a fabric filter level of control in the same fuel 
category. For example, the PM baseline emission factor for uncontrolled or multiclone-equipped 
biomass boilers is 0.26 lb/mmBtu, and the calculated baseline emission factors for biomass 
boilers equipped with a fabric filter is 0.01 lb/mmBtu. The emission reductions were estimated 
using the difference of these two factors, or 0.25 lb/mmBtu. The methodology used to calculate 
average baseline emission factors for different fuel and control configurations is discussed in 
another memorandum.5 It was assumed that the remaining boilers that did not install a fabric 
filter will install a cyclone or multiclone to reduce PM emissions. Multiclones were identified as 
a GACT level of control for PM. Emission reductions for units expected to install a multiclone 
 D-13 
were estimated by multiplying the baseline emissions of each model unit by the expected PM 
control efficiency of a multiclone, a 75 percent reduction. These control efficiencies for various 
control devices are detailed in another memorandum.5 Model units with a design capacity greater 
than 10 mmBtu/hr were expected to already have a multiclone installed as a baseline level of 
control, so no additional PM emission reductions were estimated from these units, unless the unit 
installed a fabric filter for mercury control.  
To estimate the reductions in other non-mercury metallic HAP, the percent reduction in 
filterable PM was calculated for each model boiler expected to install a fabric filter for mercury 
control. This percent reduction was multiplied by the baseline emissions for each of the non-
mercury metallic HAP. Since fabric filters capture fine particulate, this analysis assumes that 
each model boiler would achieve an identical percent reduction from baseline emissions for each 
non-mercury metallic HAP as was achieved for PM. For model boilers that were expected to 
install a multiclone to meet the PM GACT limit, a 10 percent reduction was estimated for non-
mercury metallic HAP. 
PM2.5 emissions comprise a fraction of total filterable PM emissions depending on the 
fuel combusted and control device configuration installed on the unit. The methods used to 
derive the contribution of PM2.5 to overall filterable PM are presented in other memoranda.5 To 
calculate emission reductions for PM2.5 for each model boiler, the emission reductions for PM 
were multiplied by the applicable PM2.5 fraction.  
For any boiler conducting a tune-up or installing advanced combustion controls such as a 
replacement burner or linkageless boiler management system, a one percent gain in combustion 
efficiency was estimated, resulting in an estimated one percent emissions reduction of all 
pollutants. Efficiency gains reduce fuel use, and in turn, emissions of hazardous air pollutants.8 A 
one percent reduction in emissions for these pollutants was estimated by multiplying the baseline 
emissions for each unit by a factor of 0.01. 
To convert emission reductions from an emission rate on a heat input basis to an annual 
emission rate, Equation 2 was used: 
 D-14 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERHI * 0.0005 * Ophours * CF (Equation 2) 
Where: 
ERHI = emission rate (lb/mmBtu) 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lbs per ton 
Ophours = annual operating hours, assumed 8760 (adjusted using capacity factor) 
CF = annual average capacity factor, 0.5 for liquid and 0.65 for coal and biomass 
To convert emission reductions from a concentration basis to an annual emission rate, 
Equations 3 and 4 were used: 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERC * 0.000001 * ρair * QS * 60 * Ophours * 0.0005 * 
(20.946 – O2) / (20.946 – Std O2) * CF (Equation 3) 
Where: 
ERC = emission concentration (ppm @ 3% O2) 
0.000001 = conversion factor, ppm to parts 
ρair = density of air, 0.0749 lb/dscf 
QS = exhaust flowrate (dscfm) 
60 = conversion factor, minutes to hours 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lb per ton 
20.946 = percentage of oxygen in ambient air 
O2 = percentage of oxygen assumed in exhaust gas 
Std. O2 = 3 percent oxygen in standardized emission concentration for proposed rule.  
CF = annual average capacity factor, 0.5 for liquid and 0.65 for coal and biomass 
Annual Emission Rate (tpy) = ERC * 0.0283 * QS * 60 * Ophours * 0.000000001 * 0.0022 
* 0.0005 * (20.946 – O2) / (20.946 – Std O2) * CF (Equation 4) 
Where: 
ERC = emission concentration (ng/dscm @ 7% O2) 
0.0283 = conversion factor, dscm to dscf 
QS = exhaust flowrate (dscfm) 
60 = conversion factor, minutes to hours 
Ophours = annual operating hours reported in 2008 survey (hours/year) 
0.000000001 = conversion factor, ng to g 
0.0022 = conversion factor, g per lb 
0.0005 = conversion factor, lb per ton 
20.946 = percentage of oxygen in ambient air 
O2 = percentage of oxygen assumed in exhaust gas 
Std O2 = 7 percent oxygen in standardized emission concentration for proposed rule. 
CF = annual average capacity factor, 0.5 for liquid and 0.65 for coal and biomass 
Converting concentrations to an annual emission rate required an oxygen concentration 
and exhaust flowrate estimated for each specific fuel type. The development of these 
assumptions and estimates is presented in another memorandum.4 
 D-15 
Emission Reductions for Option 3E 
The same calculations discussed for estimating emission reductions for option 1E were 
applied to all large coal boilers. For small model boilers, the emission reductions were based on a 
one percent gain in efficiency expected from the biennial tune-up work practice standard. For 
large biomass and liquid units no add-on controls for PM or mercury are expected since these 
units are not subject to numerical emission limits for PM or Hg. Instead, a similar one percent 
gain in efficiency is expected to occur as a result of conducting an annual tune-up or installing 
advanced combustion controls necessary to meet the CO numerical limit in each category. 
Efficiency gains reduce fuel use, and in turn, emissions of hazardous air pollutants. A one 
percent reduction in all types of emissions was estimated by multiplying the baseline emissions 
for each unit by a factor of 0.01. A summary of the estimated emission reductions at existing 
units for both option 1 and option 2a are located in Appendix B-1. 
4.2 Emission Reductions from New Boilers  
Based on industrial and commercial fuel consumption projections from the EIA and a 
history of boiler installation dates in the boiler inspector inventory, there are 6,779 new area 
source boilers expected to come on-line by 2013.7 These new projected boilers are expected to 
fire biomass, coal, and liquid fuels. An average (mean) design capacity of area source boilers 
firing similar fuel type, in the same size category, and in the same sector (industrial or 
commercial) was estimated to develop new model units representative of the existing boiler 
inventory. New model units were assigned baseline emissions in the same manner as existing 
area source model units. The projection of new model area source boilers and the procedures and 
results of the baseline emissions analysis is presented in other memoranda.2 
As discussed in Section 3.4, the NSPS for Industrial, Commercial and Institutional 
Boilers (40 CFR part 60, subparts Db, Dc) (NSPS) were reviewed to identify the expected 
baseline level of control for projected new units. Then, the average baseline emission factor 
corresponding to the expected level of control and fuel category was assigned to each new model 
boiler. New biomass boilers larger than 30 mmBtu/hr were expected to install an ESP; new coal 
boilers larger than 75 mmBtu/hr were expected to install a fabric filter and wet scrubber; new 
coal boilers between 30 and 75 mmBtu/hr would only have a fabric filter installed and were 
expected to meet the SO2 limits in the NSPS by using coals with a low sulfur content; new 
 D-16 
boilers larger than 30 mmBtu/hr and combusting liquid fuels were expected to install a fabric 
filter. All new boilers less than 30 mmBtu/hr would have no add-on controls. For this impacts 
analysis, it was assumed that all new solid fuel units would be stokers, since stoker boilers are 
the most common type of solid fuel boilers and all new units would have NOx control installed 
as a baseline control, regardless of fuel. Based on the EIA fuel projections, all new coal boilers 
are projected to be less than 10 mmBtu/hr and the only 49 model boilers firing biomass are 
expected to exceed 30 mmBtu/hr.  
Emission Reductions for Option 1N 
After an appropriate baseline level of control was determined for each model unit, an 
average baseline emission factor was calculated for existing units within the same fuel category 
and having the same level of control was assigned to each model boiler. The NSPS specifies PM 
and SO2 limits for new solid- and liquid-fired combustion units based on heat input. It was 
assumed that all new solid and liquid units would be constructed to meet these limits and those 
limits were used as baseline emission values, where applicable. For units less than 30 mmBtu/hr, 
the baseline emissions for PM were estimated assuming the unit was uncontrolled and the target 
PM emission limit from the NSPS was used as the GACT level of control. The baseline 
emissions for each unit were subtracted from the new source MACT floor for Hg and CO and 
GACT emission limit for PM corresponding to each unit’s subcategory. The same calculations 
discussed in Section 4.1 of this memo were used to estimate the reductions for new units. 
Emission Reductions for Option 3N 
For new coal boilers, the emission reductions were calculated using the same methods 
discussed for Option 1N above. For new biomass boilers less than 30 mmBtu/hr, emission 
reductions for PM were calculated by subtracting the PM NSPS emission limits from a baseline 
emission factor representing uncontrolled units. Since an ESP is not expected to be very effective 
at capturing mercury emissions, mercury emissions reductions from all biomass units were 
estimated based on a one percent efficiency improvement, resulting from annual tune-ups or 
other combustion controls expected to occur in order to demonstrate compliance with CO 
emission limits. For new biomass boilers greater than or equal to 30 mmBtu/hr, there were no 
estimated additional PM or non-Hg metallic HAP emission reductions since these larger biomass 
boilers are already expected to be in compliance with a PM NSPS limit using an ESP.  
 D-17 
New residual liquid boilers less than 30 mmBtu/hr were expected to install a fabric filter 
to meet the PM emission limit. Since a fabric filter is effective at capturing fine particulate, 
additional emission reductions for mercury were calculated by subtracting the average baseline 
emission factor for heavy liquid boilers equipped with a fabric filter from the average baseline 
emission factor corresponding to an uncontrolled heavy liquid unit.  
The average baseline emission factor for PM at uncontrolled distillate liquid units is less 
than the NSPS emission limit for liquid units. As a result, no additional PM, Hg, or non-Hg 
metallic HAP emission reductions were estimated from installing additional PM controls. 
Instead, these reductions were estimated based on a one percent efficiency improvement, 
resulting from annual tune-ups or other combustion controls expected to occur in order to 
demonstrate compliance with CO emission limits.  
Under this proposed option, new small units do not qualify for the same tune-up work 
practice standards that apply to existing units since it is expected that new units can be designed 
to allow for stack test diameters that would be compatible with EPA test methods. As a result, 
new A summary of the estimated emission reductions at existing units for both option 1N and the 
proposed option 3N are located in Appendix B-2. 
Incremental Emission Reductions if Energy Audit Findings are Implemented 
We evaluated the potential additional reductions and fuel savings that could occur as a 
result of implementing certain cost-effective energy efficiency improvements identified during 
the audit. Using the Department of Energy references of a 10 to 15 percent improvement in 
efficiency, a range of incremental emission reductions was estimated considering efficiency 
gains between 5 and 10 percent. We applied the control efficiency ranges of 5 and 10 percent 
reduction to the emissions remaining after MACT level of controls were installed on the unit to 
identify the potential for additional emission reductions if the findings of an energy audit were 
implemented. Table 3 summarizes the potential additional emission reductions that could occur 
under a beyond the floor option of implementing any findings in the audit with a short term 
payback. The fuel savings were estimated using Equation 1 described in 3.1 of this memo that 
was used to estimate fuel savings. In this case the efficiency gain term was modified to be 
between 5 and 10 percent. A summary of the estimated incremental emission reduction and fuel 
savings is shown in Table 3.

5.0 METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING SECONDARY 
IMPACTS 
Secondary impacts include the solid waste and electricity required to operate air pollution 
control devices, as well as the additional energy savings resulting from improved combustion 
controls or work practices required by the NESHAP. This section documents the inputs and 
equations used to estimate these secondary impacts, and it summarizes the impacts at existing 
units under proposed regulatory option 3E and new units under proposed regulatory option 3N. 
Table 5-1 summarizes the secondary impacts of this proposed NESHAP. Appendices C-1 and C-
2 present a detailed breakdown of the secondary waste and energy impacts from each 
subcategory of existing and new boilers, respectively. 
Table 5-1: Summary of Secondary Impacts 
 
Impact New Units (proposed regulatory Option 4N) 
Existing Units 
(proposed regulatory Option 4E) 
Solid Waste (tons/yr) 1,800 14,300
Purchased Electricity (kW-hr/yr) 22 million 206 million
Energy Savings* (tBtu/yr) 2.34 19.6
* Energy savings is calculated for units in the coal and liquid subcategories. 
The secondary impacts were calculated using algorithms and assumptions described in 
another memorandum.3 These algorithms and assumptions were applied to the existing boilers, 
where the baseline emissions for each unit exceeded the proposed MACT floor emission limit. 
For new units, the algorithms and assumptions were applied to model units representing units 
expected to come online between 2010 and 2013, when the baseline emissions for each model 
exceeded the proposed MACT floor or GACT emission limit for new units. The methodology 
used to assign baseline emission factors to new and existing units are discussed in another 
memorandum.5 
5.1 Solid Waste Impacts 
Solid waste is generated from collecting dust and fly ash in fabric filters or ESP control 
devices. Solid waste impacts were estimated for every unit expected to install a fabric filter to 
meet mercury emission limits, or install an ESP to meet PM emission limits. The total national 
 D-20 
solid waste amounts in Table 5-1 were determined by adding the per unit solid waste estimates 
for all new and existing units, respectively. To estimate the solid waste contribution from each of 
these control devices, the variables were calculated based on characteristics reported for each 
model unit. The calculations used to estimate each variable and the quantity of solid waste 
generated are provided in another memorandum.3 
The solid waste (dust, fly ash) generated by the use of an electrostatic precipitator was 
calculated when an electrostatic precipitator was determined to be necessary to meet the GACT 
emission limits for PM. Estimates of the solid waste collected in an ESP was based on several 
variables including: exhaust flow rate from the combustion unit to the control device (acfm); the 
inlet loading of particulate matter to the control device (gr/acfm); operating hours (hr/year) and 
the efficiency of the control device required to meet the PM emission limits in the proposed 
NESHAP.  
The solid waste generated from the collection of dust and fly ash in a fabric filter was 
calculated when a fabric filter was determined to be necessary to meet the proposed NESHAP 
emission limits for particulate matter and/or mercury. The calculation required the use of three 
variables, including: exhaust flow rate from the combustion unit to the control device (dscfm); 
operating hours (hr/year) and the inlet loading of particulate matter to the control device 
(gr/acfm). 
5.2 Electricity Impacts 
The amount of electricity required to operate a control device was calculated for an 
electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter. These impacts were assessed for every unit that was 
estimated to require particulate matter control. Electricity requirements are one output of the cost 
algorithms used in the analyses, so no additional calculations were necessary. For some units, an 
electrical demand from multiple control devices was estimated. The total national electricity 
demand in Table 5-1 was determined by adding the per unit solid waste estimates for all new and 
existing units, respectively. To estimate the electricity demand from each of these control 
devices, a set of variables were calculated based on characteristics assigned to each model unit. 
The constants, variables, and calculations used to estimate each variable and the electricity 
demand to operate the control devices are provided in another memorandum.3  
 D-21 
5.3 Energy Savings Impacts 
The energy savings from combustion controls such as low NOx burners or linkageless 
boiler management systems, and work practice standards, including a tune-up, and implementing 
the energy audit findings with a short-term payback can improvements in efficiency, thereby 
reducing fuel consumption. Although these combustion improvements have been documented to 
achieve efficiency gains between 5 and 10 percent from the baseline operating conditions, this 
secondary impacts analysis estimates a 1 percent efficiency gain, to be conservative and 
consistent with the assumptions made in Section 3.1 of this memorandum. Quantifying the exact 
gains in efficiency from each of these work practice standards is difficult, and may depend on the 
baseline operating efficiency of each unit.  
Section 3.1 discusses the fuel savings impacts in terms of annualized cost savings to each 
boiler, and the national energy savings presented in Table 5-1 of this section follows the same 
methodology as was discussed in Section 3.1 and reflect the savings from boilers in the coal and 
liquid fuel categories only. 
5.4 Estimating Secondary Impacts for Regulatory Options 3E/3N 
Regulatory Options 3E for existing and 3N for new units are both described in detail in 
Section 2 of this memorandum. For the secondary impacts analysis at existing units under option 
3E, the waste and electricity impacts were only assessed for large units (those greater than or 
equal to 10 mmBtu/hr) that are in the coal subcategory. Secondary impacts of solid waste and 
electricity were not assessed for the liquid and biomass subcategories because these boilers were 
not subject to PM or Hg numerical emission limits and were not expected to install add-on 
controls. Energy savings were estimated for all units firing anything other than biomass since all 
units were expected to conduct a tune-up or install combustion controls. 
For new units under option 3N, the solid waste and electricity impacts were assessed for 
any size unit firing coal, liquid, or biomass. A one percent energy savings was estimated for all 
units firing coal or liquids that were estimated to require a tune-up to meet the CO limits from 
new boilers. Both tune-ups and combustion controls improve the efficiency of the unit, thereby 
reducing energy consumption.
