CHAPTER 16.   REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 
16.1 INTRODUCTION  
 The Department of Energy (DOE) has determined that energy conservation standards for 
small electric motors constitute an “economically significant regulatory action” under Executive 
Order (E.O.) 12866 “Regulatory Planning and Review.” 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993). 
Therefore, DOE’s proposed energy conservation standards require a regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA), which involves an evaluation of non-regulatory alternatives to the standards.  
 
 Under the Process Rule (Procedures for Consideration of New or Revised Energy 
Conservation Standards for Consumer Products, 61 FR 36974 (July 15, 1996); 10 CFR Part 430, 
Subpart C, Appendix A), DOE is committed to continually explore non-regulatory alternatives to 
standards. This RIA, which DOE has prepared pursuant to E.O. 12866, is subject to review under 
the Executive Order by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)’s Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). 58 FR 51735. 
 
 DOE identified five major non-regulatory alternatives to standards as representing 
feasible policy options to achieve greater energy efficiency for the products that are the subject 
of this rulemaking. These are listed in Table 17.1.1. DOE evaluated each alternative in terms of 
its ability to achieve significant energy savings at a reasonable cost, and compared the 
effectiveness of each one to the effectiveness of the proposed standards. DOE did not analyze an 
“early replacement” scenario because it did not find any data supporting an underlying trend 
toward higher efficiency over time, which suggests that early replacement would not achieve 
significant energy savings.

16.2 METHODOLOGY  
 This section describes the approach DOE used to analyze non-regulatory policies for 
small electric motors.  
 
 
16-2 
 To calculate the national energy savings and the net present value (NPV) corresponding 
to each policy alternative, DOE used its national impact analysis (NIA) spreadsheet models. (See 
Chapter 10 of the technical support document (TSD) for a description of the NIA spreadsheet 
models.) To compare each alternative to the proposed standards, DOE quantified the effect of 
each alternative on the purchase of small electric motors meeting the target levels, which are 
defined as the efficiency levels in the proposed standards. Once it had made the quantitative 
assumptions for each alternative policy, DOE made the appropriate revisions to the inputs in the 
NIA spreadsheet models. The main model inputs that DOE revised were market shares of 
equipment at target efficiencies and shipment-weighted average annual energy consumption. The 
shipments for any given year are comprised of a distribution of efficiency levels. DOE assumed 
that standards would affect 100 percent of the shipments, while the non-regulatory policies 
would affect a smaller percentage of the shipments. In each policy case, DOE made particular 
assumptions about the percentage of shipments impacted by the policy under analysis. DOE then 
calculated the shipment-weighted average energy consumption and costs using these market 
shares.  
 
 A shift in the market share of higher efficiency units may increase the average installed 
cost of energy-consuming equipment. Operating costs will generally decrease due to a decline in 
energy consumption. Therefore, DOE calculated an NPV for non-regulatory alternatives in the 
same way as it did for the proposed standards. In some scenarios, total installed cost increases 
are partially mitigated by government rebates or tax credits. However, DOE assumed that credits 
and rebates would be paid for in another form (such as additional taxes), and therefore did not 
include them as a benefit for the purposes of calculating the national NPV. DOE did not consider 
administrative costs for any of the non-regulatory policies in its analysis. Inclusion of such costs 
would decrease their NPVs by a small amount. 
 
 The key measures of the impact of each alternative are: 
 
• National energy savings in quadrillion Btus (quads): Cumulative national primary energy 
savings for equipment bought in the period from the effective date of the policy case 
(2015) to the year 2045.  
 
• Net present value: The value of net monetary savings from equipment bought in the 
period from the effective date of the policy case (2015) to the year 2045. DOE calculated 
the NPV as the difference between the present value of equipment and operating 
expenditures (including energy) in the base case and the present value of expenditures in 
each alternative policy case. DOE calculated operating expenses (including energy) for 
the life of the equipment. 
16.2.1 Policy Assumptions  
 The impacts of non-regulatory policies are by nature uncertain, since they depend on 
program implementation and marketing efforts and the subsequent consumer behavior response. 
The projected impacts depend on the assumptions regarding the consumer participation rate, and 
are therefore subject to more uncertainty than the impacts of mandatory standards, which DOE 
 
16-3 
assumes will have full compliance. To increase the robustness of the analysis, DOE conducted a 
literature review on each non-regulatory policy and consulted with key experts to gather 
information on similar incentive programs that have already been implemented in the U.S. By 
studying field experience with sample programs of each type, DOE sought to make credible 
assumptions of their potential market impacts. Section 16.3 below reports the conclusions from 
this research as they apply to the policy modeling assumptions and includes the corresponding 
literature citations. 
 
 Each of the policy alternatives to the proposed standards that DOE considered would 
improve the average efficiency of new small electric motors relative to the base case (no new 
regulatory action). The analysis considered that each alternative policy would induce consumers 
to purchase units at higher efficiency levels than they would otherwise purchase, reaching the 
efficiency levels corresponding to the proposed standards, or the target levels. In contrast to the 
proposed standards, however, their market penetration rate in the alternative policy cases may 
not be 100 percent. 
 
 The efficiency levels corresponding to the proposed standards for polyphase small 
electric motors are those in TSL 5, as shown in Table 16.2.1. The proposed standards for 
capacitor-start induction-run (CSIR) and capacitor-start capacitor-run (CSCR) small electric 
motors are those in TSL 7, as shown in Tables 16.2.2 and 16.2.3.

 DOE assumed that the non-regulatory policy impacts would last from the effective date 
for proposed standards for small electric motors—2015—through the end of the analysis period, 
2045. 
16.2.2 Policy Interactions  
 DOE calculated the impacts of each regulatory policy separately from those of the other 
policies. In actual practice, certain policies are often most effective when implemented in 
combination to provide incentives, such as bulk government purchases with consumer rebates. 
DOE attempted to make conservative assumptions to avoid double-counting policy impacts. 
Therefore, the policy impacts reported below are not additive; the combined impact of several or 
all of the policies may not be inferred from adding the results together.

16.3 NON-REGULATORY POLICY ASSUMPTIONS  
16.3.1 No New Regulatory Action  
 The case in which no new regulatory action is taken with regard to small electric motor 
efficiency constitutes the base case scenario described in Chapter 10. This case defines the basis 
of comparison for all other scenarios. By definition, no new regulatory action yields zero energy 
savings and an NPV of zero dollars. 
16.3.2 Financial Incentives Policies  
 DOE considered scenarios in which the Federal government would provide two types of 
financial incentives: rebates and tax credits. The government could provide consumers with a 
rebate for purchasing energy efficient equipment meeting the target level for each product. Tax 
credits could be offered to consumers who purchase target-level small electric motors. The 
government could also provide tax credits to manufacturers to offset costs associated with 
producing such equipment.  
 
 DOE’s evaluation of consumer rebates used a comprehensive study of the potential for 
energy efficiency in California performed by Xenergy, Inc., which summarized experience with 
various utility rebate programs.1 This analysis method is based on curves that estimate the 
market penetration of a technology based on its benefit/cost (B/C) ratio. DOE consulted with 
experts and reviewed several other methods of estimating market penetration of efficient 
technologies due to consumer rebate programs that were developed since the referenced Xenergy 
report was published.2,3,4,5 However, these methods were based either on other economic
parameters (payback period) or on expert surveys predicting penetration of a new technology 
over time. Therefore, DOE decided to use the penetration curve method based on B/C ratio, 
which incorporates lifetime operating cost savings, and was calibrated with utility rebate 
program participation results. 
 
 Xenergy’s information diffusion model estimates market impacts induced by financial 
incentives for energy efficient appliances. The basic premise of this model is that information 
diffusion drives technology adoption. The model is formulated to characterize the influences of 
both internal and external sources of information on consumer behavior by superimposing two 
components in the equation, each capturing the effect of one of two different types of 
information source. The effects of these two types of information diffusion mechanisms are 
different. Internal sources of information influence consumers to purchase new products due 
mainly to word-of-mouth from early adopters, while external information sources influence 
consumers to change their adoption decisions as a result of marketing efforts and information 
coming from outside the consumer group. (Appendix 16A of the TSD contains further details on 
modeling these influences.) 
 
 Xenergy’s model combined these two information diffusion mechanisms and generated a 
set of measure “implementation curves” or penetration curves, which Xenergy calibrated using 
 
16-6 
evaluation data from utility rebate programs. Consumer response to rebate incentives appears to 
be a combination of the two information source types. The penetration curves illustrate the 
increased penetration (i.e., increased market share) of efficient equipment as a result of consumer 
response to B/C ratio changes induced by a specific rebate program. The penetration curves are 
used to depict various diffusion patterns based on perceived barriers to consumer purchase of 
high-efficiency equipment. There are penetration curves for varying levels of market barriers, 
from “no barriers” to “extremely high barriers.” These curves provide a means to study the 
impact of changing the B/C ratio, by reducing the initial equipment cost through financial 
incentives, on the consumer participation rate.  
 
 The penetration curves do not exactly model the dynamics of a particular equipment 
market. Therefore, DOE used them in the following way to predict changes in equipment market 
shares. If the current market share is 0.0%, DOE assumed that the market share would increase 
to be equal to the difference between the penetration-curve market share at the no-rebate B/C 
ratio and the penetration-curve with-rebate B/C/ ratio. If the current market share at the target 
level is greater than zero, DOE used the penetration curve to determine that ratio between the 
with-rebate and no-rebate market shares, and applied this ratio to the motor market under 
consideration. DOE limited the effect of the rebate by assuming that it could no increase the 
market share above the maximum for the corresponding penetration curve. For example, if the 
current market share were 5% and the penetration curve predicted a no-rebate market share of 
3% and a with-rebate market share of 12%, DOE would assume that the rebate would increase 
the target-level market share by a factor of 4, to 20%. 
 
 DOE based its estimates of the impacts of consumer tax credits on actual program 
experience with State tax credits in Oregon. DOE studied State tax credits in Montana as well. 
DOE also attempted to determine residential consumer participation due to the Federal appliance 
tax credits, which were mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005). For the 
manufacturer tax credits policy, DOE attempted to investigate manufacturer participation due to 
the efficient equipment tax credits from EPACT 2005. Both the Federal consumer and 
manufacturer credits were in effect in 2006 and 2007. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) had not yet published data on taxpayer response to either of these tax credits.  
 
 DOE also incorporated previous research that had differentiated the impact of tax credits 
into the “direct price effect,” which arises from the incremental equipment cost savings, and the 
“announcement effect,” which is independent of the credit amount.6,7 The announcement effect 
derives from the credibility that a particular technology receives from its inclusion in an 
incentive program, as well as changes in product marketing strategy, and the resulting 
modifications in markups and pricing. DOE assumed that the direct price effect and the 
announcement effect would apply to the consumer tax credit policy as well as the consumer 
rebate policy, and that half of the increases in market penetration associated with either policy 
would be due to the direct price effect and half to the announcement effect.  
 
16-7 
16.3.2.1 Consumer Rebates  
 DOE modeled the impact of the consumer rebate policy by determining the increase in 
market penetration of target-level equipment relative to its market penetration in the base case.  
Polyphase Small Electric Motors 
 For conventional cooking products, DOE estimated the impact of increasing the 
benefit/cost (B/C) ratio via a rebate that paid a portion of the incremental installed cost between a 
unit meeting the baseline efficiency level and a unit meeting the target efficiency level. DOE 
based the rebate amount on a large sample of utility rebate programs for NEMA Premium-rated 
polyphase electric motors (three-digit frame series). Since DOE found no rebate programs for 
small electric motors, DOE chose these larger motors as similar equipment, with similar market 
dynamics. DOE gathered data on rebate programs for 1 horsepower motors offered by 48 
agencies or utilities throughout the country. (See Appendix 16A for a listing of these rebate 
programs.) The simple average of the rebate amounts in these programs, $26, is roughly 25% of 
the incremental cost between a 1 HP three-digit frame series motor which meets current 
efficiency standards for medium motors and a motor which meets NEMA Premium efficiency. 
NEMA Premium efficiency for medium motors corresponds most closely with TSL 5, the 
Department’s proposed standard level for small polyphase motors. DOE assumed that a rebate 
program for small polyphase electric motors would offer a similar rebate of $25 for a 4 pole, 1 
HP motor, with rebate amounts for other motor speeds and powers scaling in the same fashion as 
motor cost (see chapter 8 for a discussion of price scaling). DOE assumed the rebates would 
remain in effect until they had transformed the markets so that the shift in market share of 
efficient units seen in the first year of the programs would be maintained throughout the forecast 
period (2015–2045).  
 
 DOE first calculated the B/C ratio for the target 4-pole 1 HP unit without a rebate. It then 
calculated another B/C ratio for the unit meeting the target level, with a rebate, relative to the 
baseline unit. Because of the incremental cost reductions due to the rebates, the B/C ratios for the 
rebate policy unit were larger. Table 17.3.1 shows the benefits as lifetime operating cost savings, 
incremental installed costs without rebates and with rebates, and B/C ratios without rebates and 
with rebates.

 DOE then used the B/C ratios with the penetration curve shown in Figure 17.3.1 to 
estimate the increased percentage of consumers who would purchase the units that meet the 
policy target levels if given a rebate incentive. For polyphase small electric motors, DOE 
selected the “moderate barriers” curve, which has the greatest degree of correspondence (among 
the curves prepared by Xenergy) between the market share calculated from the B/C ratio of each 
efficiency level and the current market share for each efficiency level. Figure 17.3.1 shows the 
increase in penetration rates of target-level units as a function of their higher B/C ratios. Using 
the method discussed above, DOE estimated that the market share of equipment meeting the 
policy target due to a rebate policy would increase by 0.4 percent above the base case market 
share for polyphase small electric motors.  
 
 To calculate the impacts of this policy, DOE adjusted the market shares of polyphase 
small electric motors at the target efficiencies in its NIA model to represent the policy case 
scenario. Table 16.3.2 shows the efficiency distribution used.

Capacitor-Start Small Electric Motors  
 For capacitor-start small electric motors, DOE assumed that the rebate would cover a 
portion of the incremental cost between a motor meeting the baseline efficiency level and a unit 
meeting the target efficiency level. DOE assumed that the rebate amount for a 1 HP motor would 
be equal to the $25 rebate offered for 1 HP polyphase small electric motors (based, in turn, on 
current rebate programs for three-digit frame series polyphase motors). Similar to polyphase 
motors, DOE assumed that the rebate amount would scale with the number of poles and power of 
the motor in the same fashion as motor prices scale. DOE assumed the rebates would remain in 
effect until they had transformed the markets so that the shift in market share of efficient units 
seen in the first year of the programs would be maintained throughout the forecast period (2015–
2045). 
 
 DOE first analyzed the impact of rebates at the efficiency levels prescribed by TSL 7. 
However, for CSIR motors at this efficiency level, a $25 rebate (scaled from a 1 HP motor) had 
no effect on the efficiency distribution of CSIR motor shipments. Therefore, DOE chose to 
undertake the remainder of its analysis of policy alternatives with the efficiency levels 
corresponding to TSL 5. 
 
 
16-9 
 
16-10 
 For each type of capacitor-start motor (induction-run and capacitor-run), DOE first 
calculated the B/C ratio for the target unit without a rebate. It then calculated another B/C ratio 
for the unit meeting the target level, with a rebate, relative to the baseline unit. Because of the 
incremental cost reductions due to the rebates, the B/C ratios for the rebate policy unit were 
larger. Table 17.3.3 shows the benefits as lifetime operating cost savings, incremental installed 
costs without rebates and with rebates, and B/C ratios without rebates and with rebates.

 DOE then used the B/C ratios with the penetration curves shown in Figures 17.3.2 and 
17.3.3 to estimate the increased percentage of consumers who would purchase the units that meet 
the policy target levels if given a rebate incentive. For CSIR motors, DOE chose the “moderate 
barriers” curve. In the case of CSIR motors, the incremental cost between the baseline and the 
TSL is substantial, and the benefit-cost ratios of less energy-efficient levels, compared with their 
market shares, indicate that the “moderate barriers” curve is the best fit. Figure 17.3.6 shows the 
increase in penetration rates of target-level CSIR units as a function of their higher B/C ratios. 
Using the method discussed above, DOE estimated that the market share of equipment meeting 
the policy target due to a rebate policy would increase by 0.3 percent. For CSCR motors, DOE 
chose the “low barriers” curve, because the incremental cost between the baseline and the TSL is 
small and there is currently substantial market share at or above the target level. Figure 17.3.7 
shows the increase in penetration rates of target-level CSCR units as a function of their higher 
B/C ratios. Using the method discussed above, DOE estimated that the market share of CSCR 
equipment meeting the policy target due to a rebate policy would increase by 8.5 percent.  
 
 To calculate the impacts of this policy, DOE adjusted the market shares of capacitor-start 
motors at the target efficiencies in its NIA model to represent the policy case scenarios. Table 
17.3.4 shows the efficiency distributions used. DOE also adjusted the relative shipment-weighted 
average prices of CSIR and CSCR motors to incorporate the rebate amounts and used its 
modified logistic market share model to incorporate rebates into its model of the relative market 
share of CSIR and CSCR motors within each combination of power and number of poles.

Other Capacitor-Start Rebate Scenarios 
 DOE analyzed two additional consumer rebate scenarios for capacitor-start motors. The 
first scenario models the impact of a $25 rebate for 1 HP CSIR motors (as well as scaled rebates 
for other classes) which meet the efficiency of efficiency level 4, rather than level 6. CSCR 
rebates in this scenario continue to promote the target efficiency level (level 3). This corresponds 
to a rebate program targeting capacitor-start TSL 2. This rebate reimburses the consumer for a 
significantly larger fraction of the incremental cost, resulting in significantly greater utilization 
of the rebate program.  Table 17.3.5 shows the B/C ratios for this scenario.

 DOE then used the B/C ratios with the penetration curves shown in Figures 17.3.2 and 
17.3.3 to estimate the increased percentage of consumers who would purchase the units that meet 
efficiency level 4 if given a rebate incentive. DOE again chose the “high barriers” curve for 
CSIR motors and the “low barriers” curve for CSCR motors. Using the method discussed above, 
DOE estimated that the market share of CSIR equipment at efficiency level 4 would increase by 
11.2 percent.

 DOE’s CSIR/CSCR market share model, detailed in section 9.4, indicates that there are 
significant market barriers to the purchase of CSCR motors, even when it would be cost effective 
for consumers to do so. DOE therefore analyzed a rebate scenario which targets only CSCR 
motors. This scenario models the effects of relatively large rebates ($50 for 1 HP motors) for 
CSCR motors which meet the policy-target efficiency level (efficiency level 3, corresponding to 
TSL 7), where there is no rebate for CSIR motors.  Table 17.3.7 shows the B/C ratios and 
resulting market share impacts for this scenario.

 DOE then used the CSCR B/C ratios with the penetration curve shown in Figure 17.3.3 to 
estimate the increased percentage of consumers who would purchase CSCR motors which meet 
the target efficiency level. DOE again chose the “low barriers” penetration curve. Using the 
method discussed above, DOE estimated that the market share of CSCR equipment at efficiency 
level 3 (the CSCR level of TSL 6) would increase by 23.9 percent. DOE again used its 
CSIR/CSCR market share model to model the impact of this differential rebate program on 
CSCR market share within each equipment class. DOE found that this program would increase 
total shipments of CSCR motors in the analysis period (2015-2045) from 6.9 million in the base 
case to 11.1 million. 
 
 To calculate the impacts of these policies, DOE adjusted the market shares of capacitor-
start small electric motors at the relevant efficiencies in its NIA model to represent the policy 
case scenarios. Table 16.3.8 shows the efficiency distributions used to analyze these rebate 
policies.

16.3.2.2 Consumer Tax Credits  
 Consumer tax credits cover a percentage of the difference in incremental product price 
between equipment meeting baseline efficiency levels and that with higher efficiencies. 
Consumer tax credits are considered a viable non-regulatory market transformation program, as 
shown by the inclusion of Federal consumer tax credits in EPACT 2005 for various residential 
appliances.  
 
 DOE estimated that for both polyphase and capacitor-start small electric motors, the 
consumer participation rate would be lower than the rate of participation in consumer rebates. 
Research on tax credits has shown that the time delay to the consumer in receiving a 
reimbursement through a tax credit, plus the added transaction costs in tax return preparation, 
make the tax credit incentive less effective than a rebate received at the time of purchase. Based 
on previous analysis8, DOE assumed that only 60 percent as many consumers would take 
advantage of the tax credit as would take advantage of a rebate.  
 
 Using a similar approach as for the rebate policy, DOE estimated that the market share of 
target efficiency level motors would increase due to consumer tax credits over the base case. For 
all covered motors, these changes in percentage market penetrations are 60 percent of the market 
penetration changes estimated for the consumer rebate policy.  
 
 DOE assumed that the impact of this policy would be to permanently transform the 
market so that the increased market penetration seen in the first year of the program would be 
maintained throughout the forecast period. Table 17.3.9 shows the efficiency distributions used 
in analyzing the impact of this policy.

16.3.2.3 Manufacturer Tax Credits  
 Manufacturer tax credits are considered a viable non-regulatory market transformation 
program, as shown by the inclusion of Federal tax credits in EPACT 2005 for manufacturers of 
residential appliances. Similar to consumer tax credits, manufacturer tax credits would 
effectively result in lower product prices for consumers by an amount that covered part of the 
incremental price difference between products meeting baseline efficiency levels and those 
meeting targeted efficiency levels.  
 
 DOE assumed that this incentive policy would help reimburse manufacturers for 
retooling costs. Because these tax credits would go to manufacturers instead of consumers, DOE 
assumed that manufacturers would pass on the reduced costs. Since the direct price effect is 
approximately equivalent to the announcement effect,6 DOE estimated that half of the consumers 
assumed to take advantage of consumer tax credits would purchase more-efficient products due 
to a manufacturer tax credit program. Using this information, DOE calculated the percentage by 
which market penetration of target efficient level motors would increase due to manufacturer tax 
credits over the base case.  
 
 DOE assumed that the impact of this policy would be to permanently transform the 
market so that the increased market penetration seen in the first year of the program would be 
maintained throughout the forecast period. Table 17.3.10 shows the efficiency distributions used 
in analyzing the impact of this policy.

16.3.3 Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets  
For all categories of small electric motors, DOE assumed that the market behavior in the 
context of voluntary targets would be similar to market behavior related to the voluntary NEMA 
Premium program for three-digit frame series polyphase motors. Current market share for 
 
16-17 
NEMA Premium motors is roughly 25%. However, DOE assumed that 20% of this market share 
can be attributed to promotion, labeling, and other non-financial incentives, and 5% may be 
attributed to current rebate programs for such motors. DOE assumed that a voluntary program 
for small electric motors would achieve a 20% market share in the target efficiency levels for 
polyphase and CSIR motors. Current CSCR market share in the target level and above is 21%. 
DOE assumed that a voluntary program similar to NEMA Premium would increase this share by 
10%, to 31%.  Table 17.3.11 shows the efficiency distributions DOE assumed would result from 
a voluntary efficiency program. DOE assumed that these levels would be achieved in 2015 and 
remain constant throughout the analysis period.

16.3.4 Bulk Government Purchases  
 DOE assumed that a bulk government purchase policy would encourage Federal, State, 
and local governments to purchase equipment meeting the target efficiency levels. Aggregating 
public sector demand could provide a market signal to manufacturers and vendors that some of 
their largest customers sought suppliers with products that met an efficiency target at favorable 
prices. This program also could induce “market pull” impacts through manufacturers and 
vendors achieving economies of scale for high-efficiency products.  
 
 While there have been several bulk government purchasing initiatives at the Federal, 
State, and municipal levels, most of these programs have not tracked data on number of 
purchases or degree of compliance with procurement specifications. In many cases, procurement 
programs are decentralized, being part of larger State or regional initiatives. At the Federal level, 
the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has performed studies of savings potential for 
its procurement specifications for appliances and other equipment on which DOE based its 
assumptions for this policy. Yet FEMP does not track purchasing data, due to the complexity of 
the purchasing systems, number of vendors, etc. There is evidence of increasing interest and 
activity in “green purchasing" on the State, county, and municipal levels. While many of these 
programs target office equipment, the existence of a growing infrastructure for efficient 
 
16-18 
purchasing specifications indicates that such impacts that DOE attributed to bulk government 
purchasing programs are feasible.9,10 
 
 DOE analyzed only commercial-sector motor applications for government purchases. 
Direct government involvement in the industrial sector is very small. While direct government 
administration of housing is significant, residential applications of covered small electric motors 
are very small, and government purchases in this sector are unlikely to have a significant impact. 
DOE used the 2003 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey to determine the fraction 
of commercial floor space owned by government agencies, 23.7%, and assumed that government 
purchases an equivalent fraction of small electric motors in commercial applications. DOE then 
assumed that 80% of government purchases of small electric motors in commercial applications 
would meet the target efficiency level. For polyphase motors, such a program could increase 
market share for target-level equipment by 7.7%, while for capacitor-start motors it could 
increase the market share by 7.4%. Table 17.3.12 shows the resulting efficiency distributions, 
which DOE assumed would remain constant throughout the analysis period.

16.4 RESULTS SUMMARY FOR NON-REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES  
 Table 17.4.1 summarizes the impact of non-regulatory alternatives on the market share of 
target-level motors. (The capacitor-start TSL 2 consumer rebate does not change the market 
share of CSIR motors which meet the requirements of TSL 5 or TSL 7, but does save energy due 
to the increased market share of efficiency-level-4 CSIR motors.)

 Tables 16.4.2 and 16.4.3 show the national energy savings and NPV resulting from the 
various non-regulatory alternative policy cases, when the efficiency target levels are equal to the 
proposed standard levels for each product (except where noted). The cases in which no 
regulatory action is taken with regard to small electric motors constitute the base case (or "No 
Action") scenarios, in which energy savings and NPV are zero by definition. For comparison, the 
tables also include the impacts of the proposed energy conservation standards. The NPV amounts 
shown in Tables 16.4.2 and 16.4.3 are based on two discount rates (seven percent and three 
percent real). The non-regulatory alternatives achieve lower energy savings than the proposed 
standards and have lower NPV. Table 16.4.3 shows the energy savings and NPV corresponding 
to a market scenario in which the market share shift between CSIR and CSCR driven by each 
policy alternative is complete by 2015.
