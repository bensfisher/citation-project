CHAPTER 1 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) presents the health and welfare benefits, costs, and 
other impacts of the proposed Transport Rule focusing primarily on 2014.  
1.1 Key Findings 
EPA plans to lower the sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions of 
the electric power industry in 32 eastern states through the proposed Transport Rule.  EPA 
estimates in 2014 this proposed rule will have annual net benefits (in 2006$) between $120 
to 290 billion using a 3% discount rate and $110 and $260 billion using a 7% discount rate.  
At these respective rates, the annual social costs are $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion and the 
annual quantified benefits are $120 to $290 billion or $110 to $270 billion.  The capital costs 
spent for pollution controls installed for CAIR were not included in the annual social costs 
since the Transport Rule did not lead to their installation. Those CAIR-related capital 
investments are roughly estimated to have an annual social cost less than $1.15 to $ 1.29 
billion (under the two discount rates.)  The benefits outweigh social costs by 60 to145 to 1, 
or 55 to 130 to 1.  The benefits are primarily from 14,000 to 36,000 fewer PM2.5 and ozone-
related premature mortalities.  There are some costs and important benefits that EPA could 
not monetize.  Upon considering these limitations and uncertainties, it remains clear that the 
benefits of the proposed Transport Rule are substantial and far outweigh the costs.  The 
annualized private compliance costs to the power industry in 2014 are $2.8 billion, higher 
than the social costs.  Consideration of the above benefit cost ratios and analysis of a greater 
SO2 control suggests that, if EPA could require additional emission reductions, there could 
be greater net benefits.  Notably, since the proposed rule expedites installation of pollution 
controls in 2012 that were formerly happening by 2014, the benefits of the Transport Rule in 
2012 are actually even greater at the outset of the program. 
 The benefits and costs in 2014 of the preferred remedy (State Budgets/Limited 
Trading) in the proposed rule are in Table 1-1.   This preferred remedy covers the electric

power industry and allows intrastate emissions trading of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and limited interstate trading of these are pollutants in 32 eastern states.1   
                                                 
1 The states are AL, AR, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MR, NE, NJ, NY, NC, OH, OK, PA, SC, 
TN, TX, VA, WV, and WI.

Preferred Remedy in the Proposed Transport Rule in 2014a (billions of 2006$)

Health-related benefits: $120 to $290 + B $110 to $260 + B 
Visibility benefitse $3.6 $3.6 
Net benefits (benefits-costs) $120 to $290 $110 to $260 
 
a All estimates are rounded to two significant digits and represent annualized benefits and costs anticipated for 
the year 2014.  For notational purposes, unquantified benefits are indicated with a “B” to represent the sum 
of additional monetary benefits and disbenefits. Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these 
endpoints, and as such, these benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were able to 
quantify. A listing of health and welfare effects is provided in Table 1-6. Estimates here are subject to 
uncertainties discussed further in the body of the document. 
b The social costs are the loss of household utility as measured in Hicksian equivalent variation. 
c The reduction in premature mortalities account for over 90% of total monetized benefits. Benefit estimates 
are national except for visibility that covers Class I areas. Valuation assumes discounting over the SAB-
recommended 20-year segmented lag structure described in Chapter 5.  Results reflect 3 percent and 7 
percent discount rates consistent with EPA and OMB guidelines for preparing economic analyses (U.S. EPA, 
2000; OMB, 2003). The estimate of social benefits also includes CO2-related benefits calculated using the 
social cost of carbon, discussed further in chapter 5.  
d Potential benefit categories that have not been quantified and monetized are listed in Table 1-6. 
e Over 99% of visibility-related benefits occur within Class-1 areas located in the Eastern U.S.

1.1.1 Health Benefits 
 The proposed Transport Rule is expected to yield significant health benefits by 
reducing emissions of two key contributors to fine particle and ozone formation.  Sulfur 
dioxide contributes to the formation of fine particle pollution (PM2.5), and nitrogen oxide 
contributes to the formation of both PM2.5 and ground-level ozone. 
Our analyses suggest this would yield benefits in 2014 of $120 to $290 billion (based 
on a 3 percent discount rate) and $110 to $270 billion (based on a 7 percent discount rate) 
that includes the value of avoiding approximately 14,000 to 36,000 premature deaths, 22,000 
nonfatal heart attacks, 11,000 hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, 1.8 
million lost work days, 100,000 school absences, and 10 million days when adults restrict 
normal activities because of respiratory symptoms exacerbated by PM2.5 and ozone pollution. 
We also estimate substantial additional health improvements for children from 
reductions in upper and lower respiratory illnesses, acute bronchitis, and asthma attacks.  See 
Table 1-2 for a list of the annual reduction in health effects expected in 2014 and Table 1-3 
for the estimated value of those reductions.  In these tables we summarize the benefits 
according to whether they accrue within or beyond the Transport region (Eastern part of the 
US covered by the proposed rule).  While not analyzed here, we expect the benefits in 2012 
to be significantly larger than those modeled for 2014 because of the much greater 
incremental SO2 reductions in 2012 compared to 2014 from the base case.  This occurs 
because the proposed rule expedites the start of SO2 emissions controls that are planned in 
the base case to occur after 2012 and be underway by 2014.  
 
1.1.2 Welfare Benefits 
 The term welfare benefits covers both environmental and societal benefits of reducing 
pollution, such as reductions in damage to ecosystems, improved visibility and improvements 
in recreational and commercial fishing, agricultural yields, and forest

productivity.  Although we are unable to monetize all welfare benefits, EPA estimates the 
proposed Transport Rule will yield welfare benefits of $3.5 billion in 2014 (2006$) for 
visibility improvements in southeastern Class I (national park) areas for a total of $3.6 billion 
in benefits across southeastern, southwestern and California Class I areas.  
Figure 1-1 summarizes an array of PM2.5-related monetized benefits estimates based 
on alternative epidemiology and expert-derived PM-mortality estimate as well as the sum of 
ozone-related benefits using the Bell et al. (2004) mortality estimate.  
 Figure 1-2 summarizes the estimated net benefits for the proposed remedy by 
displaying all possible combinations of PM and ozone-related monetized benefits and costs. 
The graphic includes one estimate of ozone-related mortality and fourteen different PM2.5 
related mortality and a single 3% or 7% discounted cost estimate.2  Each of the 14 bars in 
each graph represents a separate point estimate of net benefits under a certain combination of

1.1.3 Assessment of More and Less Stringent Scenarios 
1.1.3.1 Assessment of Other Alternatives  
EPA also analyzed the costs and benefits of the two alternative proposed remedies - 
direct control and intrastate trading programs.  Finally, the Agency also considered options 
that were more and less stringent for the control of SO2 emissions. 
Air quality modeling was not conducted for these alternatives; thus we estimated the 
benefits of these alternatives by applying the same benefit per-ton approach as done for the 
alternative remedy options.  The costs of these alternatives are estimated using IPM.  Table 
1-4 below presents the health-related benefits and social costs, including net social benefit, of 
the two scenarios alongside that of the proposed Transport Rule remedy 
Table 1-4 provides the benefits of the direct control and intrastate trading remedies.

b The social costs are the loss of household utility as measured in Hicksian equivalent variation. More information on the social costs can be 
found in Chapter 8 of this RIA.    
c Due to methodological limitations, the health benefits of the direct control and intrastate trading remedies include PM2.5 –related benefits 
but omit visibility, ozone, and CO2-related benefits. We present the PM2.5 –related benefits of the proposed remedy, omitting these other 
important benefits, so that readers may compare directly the benefits of the proposed and alternate remedies.   Total benefits are 
comprised of the value of PM-related avoided premature mortalities.  The reduction in these premature mortalities in each year account 
for over 90 percent of total PM2.5 –related monetized benefits.  Benefits in this table are nationwide and are associated with NOx and SO2 
reductions. 
 d Not all possible benefits or disbenefits are quantified and monetized in this analysis.  Potential benefit categories that have not been 
quantified and monetized are listed in Table 1-6. 
e Valuation assumes discounting over the SAB-recommended 20-year segmented lag structure.  Results reflect the use of 3 percent and 7 
percent discount rates consistent with EPA and OMB guidelines. 
 
1.1.3.2 Alternatives that Are More or Less Stringent 
In accordance with Circular A-4 guidance, EPA also analyzed the costs and benefits 
of two options that differed in their stringency from the preferred State Budgets/Limited 
Trading option – one less stringent, the other more stringent. Both options have the same 
2012 requirements and varied in the requirements for SO2 emissions reductions in 2014. 
Unlike the preferred TR option which requires greater SO2 reductions in 15 states 
(Group 1) beginning in 2014 from 2012 emissions levels, the less stringent option maintains 
the 2012 requirements in all subsequent years.  This option allows about 1.4 million tons 
more SO2 to be emitted annually than the preferred approach after 2013. 
The more stringent options changes the requirement for Group 1 state SO2 emissions 
reductions beginning in 2014 and moves 8 additional states to Group 1 from Group 2.  
Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, and New 
  
 
11
Jersey join the 15 Group 1 states of the proposed rule, making 23 states in all and leaving 4 
states and the District of Columbia in Group 2.  Also, an additional 200,000 tons of SO2 
reduction is required in the 23 Group 1 states.

1.2 Not All Benefits Quantified 
 EPA was unable to quantify or monetize all of the health and environmental benefits 
associated with the proposed Transport Rule.  EPA believes these unquantified benefits are 
substantial, including the value of increased agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, 
visibility improvements, reductions in nitrogen and acid deposition and the resulting changes 
in ecosystem functions, and health and welfare benefits associated with reduced mercury 
emissions.  Table 1-6 provides a list of these benefits.

 Impacts to commercial., subsistence and recreational fishing 
a In addition to primary economic endpoints, there are a number of biological responses that have been associated with PM health effects 
including morphological changes and altered host defense mechanisms.  The public health impact of these biological responses may be 
partly represented by our quantified endpoints. 
b Cohort estimates are designed to examine the effects of long term exposures to ambient pollution, but relative risk estimates may also 
incorporate some effects due to shorter term exposures (see Kunzli et al., 2001 for a discussion of this issue). While some of the effects of 
short term exposure are likely to be captured by the cohort estimates, there may be additional premature mortality from short term PM 
exposure not captured in the cohort estimates included in the primary analysis. 
c May result in benefits or disbenefits. 
 
1.3 Costs and Economic Impacts 
 For the affected region, the projected annual incremental private costs of the 
proposed remedy option (intrastate trading with some interstate trading) to the power 
industry are $3.7 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in 2014.  Costs are lower in 2014 than in 
2012 as the rule becomes more stringent because there are larger amounts of State and 
Federally enforceable controls that happen between 2012 and 2014 in the baseline.  There are 
two other remedy options that EPA examined as part of our analyses.   A remedy option that 
relies solely on intrastate trading has projected annual incremental private costs of $4.2 
billion in 2012 and $2.7 billion in 2014.  Finally, a remedy option that applies controls 
directly to affected units with no trading (direct control remedy) yields projected annual 
incremental private costs of $4.3 billion in 2012 and $3.4 billion in 2014.  These costs 
  
 
14
represent the total cost to the electricity-generating industry of reducing NOx and SO2 
emissions to meet the emissions caps set out in the rule.  Estimates are in 2006 dollars.  
These costs of the rule are estimated using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). 
In estimating the net benefits of regulation above, the appropriate cost measure is 
“social costs.”  Social costs represent the welfare costs of the rule measured as the loss of 
consumer utility in the macroeconomic analysis of this rule proposal.   
There are several national changes in energy prices that result from the Transport 
Rule.  Retail electricity prices are projected to increase nationally by an average of 2.5 % in 
2012 and 1.5 % in 2014 with the proposed Transport Rule.  The effects of the proposed rule 
on natural gas prices and the power-sector generation mix is also small, with a 1.7 percent or 
less increase in delivered gas prices projected in 2012 and 0.5 % in 2014.    
There are several other types of energy impacts from the Transport Rule.  A relatively 
small amount of coal-fired capacity, about 1.2 GW (0.3 percent of all coal-fired capacity and 
0.1 % of all generating capacity), is projected to be uneconomic to maintain.  In practice 
units projected to be uneconomic to maintain may be “mothballed,” retired, or kept in service 
to ensure transmission reliability in certain parts of the grid.  For the most part, these units 
are small and infrequently used generating units that are dispersed throughout the proposed 
Transport Rule region.  Coal production for use in the power sector is projected to decrease 
by 0.3 % in 2012 and by 0.8 % by 2014, and we expect greater coal production in 
Appalachia and the West and 15 % less production in the Interior coal regions of the country 
with the proposed Transport Rule.  
In 2014, EPA estimates that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and consumption levels 
are approximately 0.01 % lower ($1.6 billion) with the proposed Transport Rule.   There are 
declines of less than 0.05 % in GDP by region except for the Plains and West, where regional 
GDP increases as productive activities shift to these less regulated regions.  Overall, the 
impacts of the proposed rule are modest, particularly in light of the large projected benefits 
mentioned earlier. 
  
 
15
1.4   Small Entity and Unfunded Mandates Impacts 
 After preparing an analysis of small entity impacts, EPA has certified that this proposal 
will have no SISNOSE (significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities). 
First, of the 30 small entities (out of 81 affected) projected to have costs greater than 1 percent of 
revenues, around 75 percent of them operate in cost of service regions and would generally be 
able to pass any increased costs along to rate-payers.  Furthermore, of the approximately 550 
units identified by EPA as being potentially owned by small entities, approximately two-thirds 
of the units that have higher costs are not expected to make operational changes as a result of 
this rule (e.g.  install control equipment or switch fuels).  Their increased costs are largely due to 
increased cost of the fuel they would be expected to use whether or not they had to comply with 
the proposed rule.  Further, increased fuel costs are often passed through to rate-payers as 
common practice in many areas of the U.S. due to fuel adder arrangements instituted by state 
public utility commissions.  Finally, EPA’s decision to exclude units smaller than 25 Megawatt 
capacity (MW) has already significantly reduced the burden on small entities. 
 EPA examined the potential economic impacts on state and municipality-owned 
entities associated with this rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected states will 
implement control measures to meet their emissions.  These impacts have been calculated to 
provide additional understanding of the nature of potential impacts and additional 
information.   
According to EPA’s analysis, of the 84 government entities considered in this 
analysis and the 482 government entities in the Transport Rule region that are included in 
EPA’s modeling, 27 may experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues in 
2014, based on our assumptions of how the affected states implement control measures to 
meet their emissions budgets as set forth in this rulemaking. 
  
 
16
 Government entities projected to experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of 
revenues may have some potential for significant impact resulting from implementation of the 
Transport Rule.  However, it is EPA’s position that because these government entities can pass 
on their costs of compliance to rate-payers, they will not be significantly affected.  Furthermore, 
the decision to include only units greater than 25 MW in size exempts 380 government entities 
that would otherwise be potentially affected by the Transport Rule. 
 
1.5 Limitations and Uncertainties 
 Every analysis examining the potential benefits and costs of a change in 
environmental protection requirements is limited to some extent by data gaps, limitations in 
model capabilities (such as geographic coverage), and variability or uncertainties in the 
underlying scientific and economic studies used to configure the benefit and cost models.  
Despite the uncertainties, we believe this benefit-cost analysis provides a reasonable 
indication of the expected economic benefits and costs of the proposed Transport Rule. 
For this analysis, such uncertainties include possible errors in measurement and 
projection for variables such as population growth and baseline incidence rates; uncertainties 
associated with estimates of future-year emissions inventories and air quality; variability in 
the estimated relationships between changes in pollutant concentrations and the resulting 
changes in health and welfare effects; and uncertainties in exposure estimation.   
EPA’s cost estimates assume that all states in the proposed Transport Rule region 
participate in the programs that reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from the power industry.   
Below is a summary of the key uncertainties of the analysis: 
Costs 
 Analysis does not capture employment shifts as workers are retrained at the same 
company or re-employed elsewhere in the economy.   
 We do not include the costs of certain relatively small permitting costs associated with 
Title V that new program entrants face.  
 Technological innovation is not incorporated into these cost estimates. 
  
 
17
 Economic impacts do not take into response of electric power consumers to changes in 
electricity prices.  While this response is likely to be of small magnitude, it may have 
some impact on the final estimate of private compliance costs.  
Benefits 
 Most of the estimated PM-related benefits in this rule accrue to populations exposed to 
higher levels of PM2.5.  Of these estimated PM-related mortalities avoided, about 80% 
occur among populations initially exposed to annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m3 and 
about 97% occur among those initially exposed to annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 µg/m3 ; 
these are the lowest air quality levels considered in the Laden et al. (2006) and Pope et al. 
(2002) studies, respectively. This fact is important, because as we estimate PM-related 
mortality among populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are successively lower, our 
confidence in the results diminishes. However, our analysis shows that the great majority 
of the impacts occur at higher exposures. 
 There are uncertainties related to the health impact functions used in the analysis.  These 
include: within study variability; across study variation; the application of concentration-
response (C-R) functions nationwide; extrapolation of impact functions across 
population; and various uncertainties in the C-R function, including causality and 
thresholds.  Therefore, benefits may be under- or over-estimates.  
 Analysis is for 2014, and projecting key variables introduces uncertainty.  Inherent in any 
analysis of future regulatory programs are uncertainties in projecting atmospheric 
conditions and source level emissions, as well as population, health baselines, incomes, 
technology, and other factors.   
 This analysis omits certain unquantified effects due to lack of data, time and resources.  
These unquantified endpoints include other health and ecosystem effects.  EPA will 
continue to evaluate new methods and models and select those most appropriate for 
estimating the benefits of reductions in air pollution.  Enhanced collaboration between air 
quality modelers, epidemiologists, toxicologists, ecologists, and economists should result 
in a more tightly integrated analytical framework for measuring benefits of air pollution 
policies. 
  PM2.5 mortality benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized benefits 
(over 90%), and these estimates have following key assumptions and uncertainties.   
1. The PM2.5 -related benefits of the alternative scenarios were derived through a 
benefit per-ton approach, which does not fully reflect local variability in 
population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or 
other local factors that might lead to an over-estimate or under-estimate of the 
actual benefits of controlling SO2. 
2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality.  This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ 
significantly from direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial 
  
 
18
sources, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects 
estimates by particle type. 
3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear within the 
range of ambient concentrations under consideration.  Thus, the estimates include 
health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of 
PM2.5, including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and 
those that do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations. 
4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality, we include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert 
elicitation study in addition to our core estimates.  Even these multiple 
characterizations omit the uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence 
rates, populations exposed and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse 
locations.  As a result, the reported confidence intervals and range of estimates 
give an incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates.  
This information should be interpreted within the context of the larger uncertainty 
surrounding the entire analysis.

CHAPTER 2 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
2.1 Introduction 
 EPA is proposing actions to address the interstate transport of emissions of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) that contribute significantly to nonattainment and 
maintenance problems with respect to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) 
for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that EPA promulgated in 1997 and 2006 and for 8-hour 
ozone that were promulgated in 1997.  In this action, EPA is proposing to both identify and 
eliminate emissions within states in the eastern United States that significantly contribute to 
nonattainment and interfere with maintenance of the ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS in other 
downwind states.  This document presents the health and welfare benefits of the proposed 
Transport Rule and compares the benefits of this rule to the estimated costs of implementing 
the rule in 2012 and 2014.  This chapter contains background information relative to the rule 
and an outline of the chapters of the report. 
 
2.2 Background 
Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) requires states to prohibit emissions 
that contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other 
state with respect to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  In this 
proposed rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing actions to partially 
or fully address the interstate transport of emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), and the fine particulate that they form in the atmosphere, that contribute significantly 
to nonattainment and interfere with maintenance with respect to the fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5) NAAQS promulgated in 1997 and 2006.   EPA is also proposing actions to partially 
or fully address the interstate transport of NOx and the ozone that it forms in the atmosphere 
that contribute significantly to nonattainment and interfere with maintenance with respect to 
the 8-hour ozone NAAQS promulgated in 1997.    
 With this proposal, EPA is responding to the remand of the Clean Air Interstate Rule 
(CAIR) by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2008.  CAIR, promulgated May 
  
 
 
 
21
12, 2005 (70 FR 25162) and the CAIR federal implementation plans (FIPs), promulgated 
April 26, 2006 (71 FR 25328), aimed to address the interstate transport of pollutants that 
contributed significantly to downwind nonattainment of the PM2.5 and 8-hour ozone NAAQS 
promulgated in July 1997.  In July 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court found CAIR and the CAIR 
FIPs unlawful.  North Carolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The Court’s original 
decision vacated CAIR.  Id. at 929-30.  However, the Court subsequently remanded CAIR to 
EPA without vacatur because it found that “allowing CAIR to remain in effect until it is 
replaced by a rule consistent with our opinion would at least temporarily preserve the 
environmental values covered by CAIR.”  North Carolina v. EPA, 550 F.3d 1176, 1178 
(D.C. Cir. 2008).   
2.2.1 Methodology for Identifying Needed Reductions 
As described in section IV of the preamble for this proposed rule, EPA is proposing a 
state-specific methodology to identify specific reductions that states in the eastern United 
States must make to satisfy the CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) prohibition on emissions that 
significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance in a downwind state.  
To facilitate implementation of the requirement that significant contribution and interference 
with maintenance be eliminated, EPA developed state emissions budgets.  These are new 
emissions budgets which are based on the Agency’s state-by-state analysis of each upwind 
state’s significant contribution to nonattainment and interference with maintenance 
downwind.  A state’s emissions budget is the quantity of emissions that would remain after 
elimination of significant contribution and interference with maintenance in an average year, 
assuming no abnormal meteorology or disruptions in electricity supply.  EPA proposes SO2 
and NOx budgets for each state covered for the 24-hour and/or annual PM2.5 NAAQS.  EPA 
also proposes an ozone season3 NOx budget for each state covered for the 8-hour ozone 
NAAQS. 
 
 
                                                 
3  Consistent with the approach taken by the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), the NOX SIP call, 
and the CAIR, we propose to define the ozone season, for purposes of emissions reduction requirements in this 
rule, as May through September.  We recognize that this ozone season for regulatory requirements will have 
differences from the official state-specific monitoring season. 
  
 
 
 
22
2.2.2 How Reductions Will Be Achieved, and Different Options to Do So 
EPA is proposing federal implementation plans (FIPs) to immediately implement the 
emissions reduction requirements.  The FIPs would regulate electric generating units (EGUs) 
in the 32 covered states.  EPA is proposing to regulate these sources through a program that 
uses state-specific budgets and allows intrastate and limited interstate trading.  EPA is also 
taking comment on two alternative regulatory options.  All three options would achieve the 
emission reductions necessary to address the emissions transport requirements in section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act. 
2.2.3 States Covered by the Proposed Rule 
In this action, EPA proposes SO2 and NOx emissions controls in the following 26 
jurisdictions that contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance 
by, a downwind area with respect to the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS promulgated in September 
2006:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa,  Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
EPA proposes SO2 and NOx emissions controls in the following 24 jurisdictions that 
contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, a downwind 
area with respect to the annual PM2.5 NAAQS promulgated in July 1997:  Alabama, 
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin. 
EPA also proposes ozone season NOx emissions controls in the following 26 
jurisdictions that contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance 
by, a downwind area with respect to the 8-hour ozone NAAQS promulgated in July 1997:  
Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, 
Virginia, and West Virginia. 
  
 
 
 
23
As discussed above, EPA is proposing FIPs to directly regulate EGU SO2 and/or NOx 
emissions in the 32 covered states.  The proposed FIPs would require the 28 jurisdictions 
covered for purposes of the 24-hour and/or annual PM2.5 NAAQS to reduce SO2 and NOx 
emissions by specified amounts.  The proposed FIPs would require the 26 states covered for 
purposes of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS to reduce ozone season NOx emissions by specified 
amounts.  For the PM2.5 NAAQS, EPA proposes two phases with an initial phase in 2012 and 
subsequent phase in 2012.  For 8-hour ozone, EPA proposes a single phase that would start 
in 2012.  
As discussed in detail in section IV of the preamble, the proposed approach to 
significant contribution and interference with maintenance would group the 28 states covered 
for 24-hour and/or annual PM2.5 NAAQS in two tiers reflecting the stringency of SO2 
reductions required to eliminate that state’s significant contribution and interference with 
maintenance.  There would be a stringent SO2 tier comprising 15 states (“group 1”) and a 
moderate SO2 tier comprising 13 states (“group 2”) with uniform stringency within each 
tier.4  For these same 28 states, there would be one annual NOx tier with uniform stringency 
of NOx reductions across all 28 states.  Similarly, for the 26 states covered for the 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS there would be one ozone season NOx tier with uniform stringency across all 
26 states. 
The proposed stringent SO2 tier (“group 1”) would include Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The proposed moderate SO2 tier 
(“group 2”) would include Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, 
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, and South 
Carolina.  
For the 15 states in the stringent SO2 tier (“group 1”), the 2014 phase would 
substantially increase the SO2 reduction requirements (i.e., these states would have smaller 
SO2 emissions budgets starting in 2014), reflecting the greater reductions needed to eliminate 
significant contribution and interference with maintenance from these states with respect to 
                                                 
4 With regard to interstate trading, the two SO2 stringency tiers lead to two exclusive SO2 trading groups. 
  
 
 
 
24
the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS.  For the 13 states in the moderate SO2 tier (“group 2”) the 2014 
SO2 emissions budgets would remain the same as the 2012 SO2 budgets for these states. 
The 2014 annual NOx emissions budgets for all 28 states covered for the 24-hour 
and/or annual PM2.5 NAAQS would remain the same as the 2012 annual NOx budgets.  See 
Table 2-1 for proposed lists of covered states.

2.3 Regulated Entities 
 This action proposes to directly regulate emissions of NOx and SO2, from electric 
generating units (EGUs) with capacity greater than 25 MW in the covered states.  
 
2.4 Baseline and Years of Analysis 
The proposed rule on which this analysis is based sets forth the requirements for 
states to address their significant contribution to downwind nonattainment of ozone and 
PM2.5 NAAQS and interference with maintenance.  To address this significant contribution 
and interference with maintenance, EPA requires that certain states reduce their emissions of 
SO2 and NOx.  The Agency considered all promulgated CAA requirements and known state 
actions in the baseline used to develop the estimates of benefits and costs for this rule.  This 
baseline analysis takes into account emissions reductions associated with the implementation 
of all federal rules promulgated by December 2008 and assumes that the CAIR is not in 
effect.  However, this baseline presents a unique situation.  EPA has been directed to replace 
the CAIR; yet the CAIR remains in place and has led to significant emissions reductions in 
many states.   
A key step in the process of developing a 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) rule involves analyzing 
existing (base case) emissions to determine which states significantly contribute to 
downwind nonattainment and maintenance areas.  EPA cannot prejudge at this stage which 
states will be affected by the rule.  For example, a state affected by CAIR may not be 
affected by the new rule and after the new rule goes into effect, the CAIR requirements will 
no longer apply.  For a state covered by CAIR but not covered by the new rule, the CAIR 
requirements would not be replaced with new requirements, and therefore an increase in 
emissions relative to present levels could occur in that state.  More fundamentally, the court 
has made clear that, due to legal flaws, the CAIR rule cannot remain in place and must be 
replaced.  If EPA’s base case analysis were to ignore this fact and assume that reductions 
from CAIR would continue indefinitely, areas that are in attainment solely due to controls 
required by CAIR would again face nonattainment problems, because the existing protection 
from upwind pollution would not be replaced.  For these reasons, EPA cannot assume in its 
base case analysis, that the reductions required by CAIR will continue to be achieved. 
  
 
 
 
29
Following this logic, the 2012 base case shows emissions higher than current levels in 
some states.  Because EPA has been directed to replace CAIR, EPA believes that for many 
states, the absence of the CAIR NOx program will lead to the status quo of the NOx Budget 
Program, which limits ozone-season NOX emissions and ensures the operation of NOX 
controls in those states.  Also, without the CAIR SO2 program, emission requirements in 
many areas would revert to the comparatively less stringent requirements of the Title IV 
Acid Rain program.  As a result, SO2 emissions in many states would increase markedly in 
the 2012 base case relative to the present.  Efforts to comply with ARP rules at the least-cost 
would occur in many cases without the operation of existing scrubbers through use of readily 
available, inexpensive Title IV allowances.  Notably, all known controls that are required 
under state laws, NSPS, consent decrees, and other enforceable binding commitments 
through 2014 are accounted for in the base case.  It is against this backdrop that the Transport 
Rule is analyzed and that significant contribution to nonattainment and interference with 
maintenance must be addressed. 
The model’s base case features an updated Title IV SO2 allowance bank assumption 
and incorporates updates related to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  
Many key assumptions, notably demand for electricity, reflect the 2008 Annual Energy 
Outlook from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 5  In addition, the model 
includes policies affecting the power sector: the Title IV of the Clean Air Act (the Acid Rain 
Program); the NOx SIP Call; various New Source Review (NSR) settlements6; and several 
state rules7 affecting emissions of SO2 and NOx that were finalized through February 3, 
2009.  IPM includes state rules that have been finalized and/or approved by a state’s 
                                                 
5 For the final rule, EPA anticipates using an updated version of IPM that will reflect assumptions from AEO 
2010.  Key differences will include lower assumptions about future electric demand and higher capital costs 
accounting for ARRA. 
6 The NSR settlements include agreements between EPA and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company 
(Vectren), Public Service Enterprise Group, Tampa Electric Company, We Energies (WEPCO), Virginia 
Electric & Power Company (Dominion), Santee Cooper, Minnkota Power Coop, American Electric Power 
(AEP), East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC), Nevada Power Company, Illinois Power, Mirant, Ohio 
Edison, and Kentucky Utilities. 
7 These include current and future state programs in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, 
Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin.

legislature or environmental agency.   
The years 2012 and 2014 are the compliance years for the proposed rule, though as we 
explain in Chapters 5 and 7 we use 2015 as a proxy for compliance in 2014 for our benefits 
and economic impact analysis due to availability of modeling impacts in that year.  We 
include analyses results for each year, but we do not include benefits and economic impact 
estimates for 2012 due to time constraints.  All estimates presented in this report represent 
annualized estimates of the benefits and costs of the Transport Rule in 2012 and 2015 rather 
than the net present value of a stream of benefits and costs in these particular years of 
analysis. 
 
2.5 Control Scenarios 
The option EPA is proposing for the FIPs ("State Budgets/Limited Trading") would 
utilize state-specific control budgets and allow for intrastate and limited interstate trading.  
This approach would assure environmental results while providing some limited flexibility 
for covered sources.  The approach would also facilitate the transition from CAIR to the 
Transport Rule for implementing agencies and covered sources. 
The first alternative remedy option for which EPA requests comment would use state-
specific emissions budgets and allow intrastate trading, but prohibit interstate trading. The 
second alternative remedy option, for which EPA also requests comment, would use state-
specific budgets and emission rate limits.   
The main difference between the three remedies lies in the kinds of flexibility they 
provide for compliance.  State Budgets/Limited Trading allows sources to trade within state 
lines and, as long as state emissions remain within the budgets plus variability limits, across 
state lines as well.  State Budgets/Intrastate Trading caps each state’s emissions at its budget 
without variability and only allows trading within (and not between) states.  Under Direct 
Control, each EGU must meet an emission rate limit (company-wide within state averaging 
allowed), and a state’s emissions must remain within its budget plus variability.  Further 
details on each of these remedies can be found in Section V. of the Transport Rule preamble. 
  
 
 
 
31
The proposed remedy option and the first alternative, both of which are cap-and-trade 
approaches, would use new allowance allocations developed on a different basis from CAIR. 
 Fossil-fuel electric generating units (EGUs) over 25 megawatt (MW) capacity within 
the proposed Transport Rule region would be covered by this action.  
 
2.6 Benefits of Emission Controls 
 The benefits of the proposed Transport Rule are discussed in Chapter 5 of this report. 
 Annual monetized benefits of $120 to 290 billion (3 percent discount rate) or $110 to 270 
billion (7 percent discount rate) are expected for the proposed rule in 2014.   
 
2.7 Cost of Emission Controls  
 EPA analyzed the costs to private industry of the proposed Transport Rule using the 
Integrated Planning Model (IPM).  EPA has used this model in the past to analyze the 
impacts of regulations on the power sector and used an earlier version of this model to 
analyze the impacts of the CAIR rule.  The social cost is measured using Hicksian equivalent 
variation and estimated using the EMPAX CGE model. IPM results are incorporated into the 
EMPAX model when calculating the social cost of the Transport Rule.  EPA estimates the 
private industry costs of the rule to the power sector to be $3.7 billion in 2012 and $2.8 
billion in 2014 (2006 dollars).  In estimating the net benefits (benefits – costs) of the rule, 
EPA uses social costs of the rule that represent the costs to society of this rule.  These social 
costs include to the impact to industries affected by changes to electricity prices resulting 
from implementation of the proposed Transport Rule.  The social costs of the rule are 
estimated by the EMPAX model to be $2.0 or $2.2 billion in 2015 (at 3 percent and 7 percent 
discount rates, respectively).  A description of the methodology used to model the costs and 
economic impacts to the power sector is discussed in Chapter 7 of this report, and a 
description of the methodology used to estimate the social cost of the rule and model 
economic impacts outside of the power sector is discussed in Chapter 8 of this report.

CHAPTER 3 
EMISSIONS IMPACTS 
This chapter summarizes the emissions inventories that are used to create emissions 
inputs to the air quality modeling that is described in Chapter 4. This chapter provides a 
summary of the baseline emissions inventories and the emissions reductions that were 
modeled for this rule. The emissions inventories are processed into a form that is required by 
the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx).  CAMx is used to estimate 
base year, future baseline and post-control concentrations of ozone and PM and deposition of 
nitrogen and sulfur, which are combined with monitoring data to estimate population-level 
exposures to changes in ambient concentrations for use in estimating health and welfare 
effects.  In the remainder of this Chapter we provide an overview of (1) the emissions 
components of the modeling platform, (2) the development of the 2005 base year emissions, 
(3) the development of 2014 future year base case emissions, and (4) the development of the 
future year control case emissions.  
 
3.1 Overview of Modeling Platform and Emissions Processing Performed 
The inputs to the air quality model; including emissions, meteorology, initial 
conditions, boundary conditions; along with the methods used to produce the inputs and the 
configuration of the air quality model are collectively known as a ‘modeling platform’.    The 
2005-based air quality modeling platform used for the proposal includes 2005 base year 
emissions and 2005 meteorology for modeling ozone and PM2.5 with CAMx (see 
http://www.camx.com/).  This platform provides an update to the now more historical data in 
the 2001-based platform used for CAIR that included 2001 emissions, 2001 meteorology for 
modeling PM2.5, and 1995 meteorology for modeling ozone.  Details on the non-emissions 
portion of the modeling platform used for the RIA are provided in described in Chapter 4.  In 
support of this proposal, EPA modeled the air quality in the East using a horizontal grid 
resolution of 12 x 12 km.  This Eastern 12 km modeling domain was “nested” within a 
  
 
 
 35 
modeling domain covering the remainder of the lower 48 states using a grid resolution of 36 
x 36 km8, therefore the tables of emissions in this section cover the contiguous 48 states.   
 Emissions estimates were made for a 2005 base year and for the 2014 future year 
scenarios.  All inventories include emissions from electric generating utilities (EGUs), 
nonEGU point sources, stationary nonpoint sources, onroad mobile sources, nonroad mobile 
sources and natural, biogenic emissions.  These emissions were derived from the 2005 v4 
emissions modeling platform, described in the 2005-based, v4 platform document 
(http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#2005). The Emissions Inventories Technical 
Support Document for Emissions Inventories for the Transport Rule (EITSD) provides more 
detail on (1) the development of the 2014 base case emissions inventories for all sectors, 
except EGUs and (2) the procedures followed to create emissions inputs to CAMx for each 
scenario modeled.  For details on EPA’s projected emissions for the EGU sector, see Chapter 
7 of this RIA. 
 For each of the modeling scenarios conducted: 2005 base year, 2014 base case, and 
2014 control case, the emissions inventory files were processed using the Sparse Matrix 
Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) Modeling System version 2.6 to produce the gridded 
model-ready emissions for input to CAMx.  SMOKE was used to create the hourly, gridded 
emissions data for the species required by CAMx species to perform air quality modeling for 
all sectors, including biogenic emissions.  See Chapter 4 for more details on the modeling 
performed with CAMx. 
 
3.2 Development of 2005 Base Year Emissions  
 Emissions inventory inputs representing the year 2005 were developed to provide a 
base year for forecasting future air quality.  The emission source sectors and the basis for 
current and future-year inventories are listed and defined in Table 3-1.  The 2005 National 
Emission Inventory (NEI), version 2 from October 6, 2008 was the starting point for the U.S. 
inventories used for the 2005 air quality modeling.  This inventory includes 2005-specific 
data for most point and mobile sources, while most nonpoint data were carried forward from 
                                                 
8 The air quality predictions from the 36 km Continental US (CONUS) domain were used to provide incoming 
“boundary” concentrations for the Eastern 12 km domain.

version 3 of the 2002 NEI.  For more information on the 2005 National Emissions Inventory 
(NEI), upon which significant portions of the 2005 modeling platform are based, see 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2005inventory.html.  A 2006 Canadian inventory and a 
1999 Mexican inventory were the latest available data from these countries and were used for 
the portions of Canada and Mexico within the modeling domains.

 The onroad and nonroad emissions were primarily based on the National Mobile 
Inventory Model (NMIM) monthly, county, process level emissions from the 2005 NEI 
version 2 (v2).  The 2005 onroad mobile emissions were augmented for onroad gasoline 
emissions sources with emissions based on a draft version of the Motor Vehicle Emissions 
Simulator (MOVES) (http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/moves/) for carbon monoxide (CO), 
NOx, VOC, PM2.5, particulate matter less than ten microns (PM10), naphthalene, and some 
VOC HAPs9.  To account for the temperature dependence of PM2.5, MOVES-based 
temperature adjustment factors were applied to gridded, hourly emissions using gridded, 
hourly meteorology.  Additional information on this approach is available in the 2005-based 
platform documentation. 
 The 2005 annual NOx and SO2 emissions for sources in the ptipm sector as defined in 
Table 3-1 are based primarily on data from EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division’s Continuous 
Emissions Monitoring (CEM) program, with other pollutants estimated using emission 
factors and the CEM annual heat input.  As noted in Table 3-1, the 2005 EGUs include those 
units operating in 2005 that are matched to the units modeled by the version of IPM used for 
this proposal, and include records with and without data submitted to the CEM program.  For 
EGUs without CEMs, emissions were obtained from the state-submitted data in the NEI. 
 For the 2005 base year, the annual EGU NEI emissions in the ptipm sector were 
allocated to hourly emissions values needed for modeling based on the 2004, 2005, and 2006 
CEM data.  The NOx CEM data were used to create NOx -specific profiles, the SO2 data were 
used to create SO2-specific profiles, and the heat input data were used to allocate all other 
pollutants.  The three years of data were used to create monthly and hourly profiles by state, 
while the 2005 data were used to create profiles for allocating monthly emissions to daily 
                                                 
9 The final version of MOVES was not available at the time we created the emissions for this proposed rule.

and hourly values. This approach to temporal allocation was used for both the 2005 base year 
and 2014 base and control emissions in order provide a temporal consistency across all 
scenarios modeled. 
 The nonpoint inventory was augmented with an oil and gas exploration inventory that 
includes emissions within the following states: Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  The commercial marine 
category 3 (C3) vessel emissions were augmented with gridded 2005 emissions from the 
previous modeling efforts for the rule called “Control of Emissions from New Marine 
Compression-Ignition Engines at or Above 30 Liters per Cylinder”.  The 2005 point source 
daily wildfire and prescribed burning emissions were replaced with average-year county-
based inventories.  Additionally, the inventories were processed to provide the hourly, 
gridded emissions for the model-species needed by CAMx.  All of these details are further 
described in the 2005-based platform documentation. 
 Tables 3-2 and 3-3 provide summaries of SO2 and NOx emissions by state by sector 
for the 2005 base year for those states within the Eastern 12 km modeling domain.  
Emissions for other states that are within the 36 km modeling domain are available in the 
EITSD.  All sectors listed are defined in Table 3-1.  In the tables, the EGU column 
summarizes all units matched to the IPM model (ptipm sector) and the nonEGU column is 
for other point source units (ptnonipm sector).  The Nonpoint column shows emissions for all 
nonpoint stationary sources (nonpt, ag, and afdust sectors).  The Nonroad column 
summarizes emissions for nonroad mobile sources, including aircraft, locomotive, and 
marine sources including the C3 commercial marine (nonroad, alm_no_c3, and seca_c3 
sectors).  The Onroad column summarizes emissions for the combined NEI and draft 
MOVES-based emissions, in which emissions from the draft MOVES were used when 
available, and NEI emissions based on MOBILE6 were used for the remainder (on_noadj, 
on_moves_runpm, and on_moves_startpm sectors).  Finally, the Fires column represents the 
average-year fire (avefire sector) emissions for wildfires and prescribed burning mentioned 
previously.

3.3 Development of Future Year Base Case Emissions  
 The future base case scenarios represent predicted emissions in the absence of any 
further controls beyond those Federal measures already promulgated.  For EGUs (ptipm 
sector), all state and other programs available at the time of modeling have been included.  
For mobile sources (on_noadj, on_moves_runpm, and on_moves_startpm sectors), all 
national measures available at the time of modeling have been included.  The future base 
case scenarios do reflect projected economic changes and fuel usage for EGU and mobile 
sectors, as described in the EITSD. For nonEGU point (ptnonipm sector) and nonpoint 
stationary sources (nonpt, ag, and afdust sectors), any local control programs that might be 
necessary for areas to attain the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS annual standard, 2006 PM NAAQS (24-
hour) standard, and the 1997 ozone NAAQS are not included in the future base case 
projections.  This is because the nonattainment areas for the 1997 PM2.5 and ozone standards 
were not announced until 2004 and 2005 respectively, and the corresponding state 
implementation plans (SIPs) were not due until 2007 and 2008, thereby preventing the 
inclusion of these local measures in the 2005 emissions inventory.   
 Table 3-4 shows a summary of the 2005 and 2014 modeled base case emissions for 
the lower 48 states. Tables 3-6 and 3-7 below provide summaries of SO2 and NOx in the 
2014 base case for each sector for the 37 states included in the 12 km modeling domain.  The 
EITSD provides summaries for carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, directly 
emitted PM2.5, and ammonia for each state in the nationwide 36 km modeling domain.  For 
information on the topic of the significant contribution of some states on air quality issues in 
other states, please see Table 2-1.

 The 2014 base case EGU emissions were obtained from version 3.02 EISA of the 
Integrated Planning Model (IPM) (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-
ipm/index.html).  The IPM is a multiregional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming 
model of the U.S. electric power sector; version 3.02 EISA features an updated Title IV SO2 
allowance bank assumption, reflects state rules and consent decrees through February 3, 
2009, and incorporates updates related to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
 Units with advanced controls (e.g., scrubber, SCR) that were not required to run for 
compliance with Title IV, New Source Review (NSR), state settlements, or state-specific 
rules were allowed in IPM to decide on the basis of abatement cost minimization whether to 
operate those controls or to use allowances for compliance.  Further details on the future year 
  
 
 
 45 
EGU emissions used for air quality modeling can be found in the IPM Documentation. Note 
that controls from the NOx SIP call were assumed to have been implemented by 2005 and 
captured in the 2005 NEI, and reductions from the Clean Air Interstate Rule are not included 
in the 2014 base case emissions. 
 Mobile source inventories of onroad and nonroad mobile emissions were created for 
2014 using a combination of the NMIM and draft MOVES models.   The future onroad 
emissions reflect control programs including the Light-Duty Vehicle Tier 2 Rule, the Onroad 
Heavy-Duty Rule, and the Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) final rule.  Emission 
reductions and increases from the Renewable Fuel Standard version 2 (RFS2) are not 
included. The future case nonroad mobile emissions reductions for these years include 
reductions to locomotives, various nonroad engines including diesel engines and various 
marine engine types, fuel sulfur content, and evaporative emissions standards.  A summary 
of the included mobile source control programs is shown in Table 3-5.  A more 
comprehensive list of control programs included for mobile sources is available in the 
EITSD. 
 The 2014 onroad emissions were primarily based on the National Mobile Inventory 
Model (NMIM) monthly, county, process level emissions.  The emissions from onroad 
gasoline sources were augmented with emissions based on the same preliminary version of 
MOVES as was used for 2005.  The same MOVES-based PM2.5 temperature adjustment 
factors were also applied as in 2005 for running mode emissions; however, cold start 
emissions used year-specific temperature adjustment factors. 
 Nonroad mobile emissions were created only with NMIM using a consistent 
approach as was used for 2005, but emissions were calculated using NMIM future-year 
equipment population estimates and control programs for 2014.  Emissions for locomotives 
and category 1 and 2 (C1 and C2) commercial marine vessels were derived for 2014 based 
on emissions published in the Locomotive Marine Rule, Regulatory Impact Assessment, 
Chapter 3 (see http://www.epa.gov/otaq/locomotives.htm#2008final).

 In the 2014 base case, we used the 2005 base year emissions for Canada and Mexico 
because future year emissions for sources in these countries were not available. 
 For nonEGU point sources, emissions were projected by including emissions 
reductions and increases from a variety of source data10.  For nonEGU point sources,

v2. 
  
 
 
 47 
emissions were not grown using economic growth projections, but, rather were held constant 
at the emissions levels in 2005.  Emissions reductions were applied to nonEGU point source 
to reflect known plant closures, refinery and other consent decrees, and reductions stemming 
from several Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards.  Since aircraft 
at airports were treated as point emissions sources in the 2005 NEI v2, we applied projection 
factors based on activity growth projected by the Federal Aviation Administration Terminal 
Area Forecast (TAF) system, published December 2008 for these sources.   
 Emissions from stationary nonpoint sources were projected using procedures specific 
to individual source categories.  Refueling emissions were projected using the refueling 
results from the NMIM runs performed for the onroad mobile sector.  Portable fuel container 
emissions were projected using estimates from previous rulemaking inventories compiled by 
the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ).  Emissions of ammonia and dust from 
animal operations were projected based on animal population data from the Department of 
Agriculture and EPA.  Residential wood combustion was projected by replacement of 
obsolete woodstoves with new woodstoves and a 1 percent annual increase in fireplaces.  
Landfill emissions were projected using MACT controls.  All other nonpoint sources were 
held constant between 2005 and the 2014 future year scenarios.

3.4 Development of Future Year Control Case Emissions  
 For the future year control case modeling, the emissions for all sectors were 
unchanged from the base case modeling except for those from EGUs.  The IPM model was 
used by CAMD to prepare the 2014 control case EGU emissions as described in Chapter 7.  
The changes in EGU SO2 and NOx emissions as a result of the control case for the lower 48 
states are summarized in Table 3-8. State-specific summaries of EGU NOx and SO2 for the 
lower 48 states for the control case are shown in Tables 3-9 and 3-10, respectively.  For EGU 
emission changes for each remedy analyzed, and for 2012 as well as 2014, please refer to 
Appendix C.  Additional details on the changes that resulted from the control case are 
provided in the Transport Rule EITSD.

CHAPTER 4 
        AIR QUALITY MODELING AND IMPACTS 
 
4.1  Air Quality Impacts 
 This section summarizes the methods for and results of estimating air quality for the 
2014 base case and control scenario for the purposes of the benefit analysis.  EPA has 
focused on the health, welfare, and ecological effects that have been linked to air quality 
changes.  These air quality changes include the following: 
1. Ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5)–as estimated using a national-
scale applications of the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions 
(CAMx; Environ, 2009); and 
2. Visibility degradation (i.e., regional haze), as developed using empirical 
estimates of light extinction coefficients and efficiencies in combination with 
CAMx modeled reductions in pollutant concentrations. 
 The air quality estimates in this section are based on the emission changes 
summarized in the preceding section.  These air quality results are in turn associated with 
human populations and ecosystems to estimate changes in health and welfare effects.  In 
Section 4.1.1, we describe the air quality modeling platform and in Section 4.2, we cover the 
impacts on PM2.5 and ozone. Lastly, in Section 4.3, we discuss the estimation of visibility 
degradation. 
 
4.1.1 Air Quality Modeling Platform 
We use the emissions inputs summarized above with national scale and regional scale 
application of the CAMx modeling system to estimate PM2.5 and ozone air quality in the 
contiguous U.S.  CAMx is a three-dimensional grid-based Eulerian photochemical model 
designed to estimate PM2.5 and ozone concentrations over annual time periods.  
Consideration of the different processes that affect primary (directly emitted) and secondary 
(formed by atmospheric processes) PM2.5 in different locations is fundamental to 
  
 
 
 56 
understanding and assessing the effects of pollution control measures that affect PM2.5 and 
ozone concentrations at the surface.11  Because it accounts for spatial and temporal variations 
as well as differences in the reactivity of emissions, CAMx is useful for evaluating the 
impacts of the rule on PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. Version 5 of CAMx was employed 
for this Transport Rule modeling, as described in the Air Quality Modeling Technical 
Support Document (EPA, 2010).   
For this analysis we used CAMx to simulate air quality for every hour of every day of 
the year.  These model applications required a variety of input files that contain information 
pertaining to the modeling domain and simulation period.  In addition to the CAMx model, 
our modeling system includes (1) emissions for a 2005 base year and emissions for the 2014 
base case and control scenario, (2) meteorology for the year 2005, and (3) estimates of 
intercontinental transport (i.e., boundary concentrations) from a global photochemical model. 
 Using these data, CAMx generates hourly predictions of ozone and PM2.5 component 
species concentrations.  As discussed in the Air Quality Modeling TSD, we use the relative 
predictions from the model by combining the 2005 base-year and each future-year scenario 
with speciated ambient air quality observations to determine the expected change in 2014 
concentrations due to the rule.  After completing this process, we then calculated annual 
mean PM2.5 and seasonal mean ozone air quality metrics as inputs to the health and welfare 
C-R functions of the benefits analysis.   
4.1.1.1 Simulation Periods 
 For use in this benefits analysis, the simulation period modeled by CAMx included 
separate full-year application for each of the three emissions scenarios (i.e., 2005 base year 
and the 2014 base case and 2014 control scenario).  
4.1.1.2 Air Quality Modeling Domain 
Although air quality estimate are provided for the entire U.S., the focus of our 
analysis is on the Eastern U.S. since this is the geographic area of importance for this rule.  
                                                 
11Given the focus of this rule on secondarily formed particles it is important to employ a Eulerian model such as 
CAMx.  The impact of secondarily formed pollutants typically involves primary precursor emissions from a 
multitude of widely dispersed sources, and chemical and physical processes of pollutants are best addressed 
using an air quality model that employs an Eulerian grid model design. 
  
 
 
 57 
The areas modeled (i.e., modeling domains) are segmented into rectangular blocks referred to 
as grid cells.  The model actually predicts pollutant concentrations for each of these grid 
cells.  Our modeling for the East (referred to as the Eastern regional scale domain) was 
performed at a horizontal resolution of 12 x 12 km.  Modeling for the remainder of the U.S. 
(referred to as the national scale domain) was performed at a resolution of 36 x 36 km.  The 
national and regional scale modeling domains contain 14 vertical layers with the top of the 
modeling domain at about 16,200 meters, or approximately 100 mb.  The Eastern domain is 
nested within the National domain, as shown in Figure 4-1.

4.1.1.3 Air Quality Model Inputs 
 CAMx requires a variety of input files that contain information pertaining to the 
modeling domain and simulation period.  These include gridded, hourly emissions estimates 
and meteorological data, and initial and boundary conditions.  Separate emissions inventories 
were prepared for the 2005 base year and each future-year scenario.  All other inputs were 
specified for the 2005 base year model application and remained unchanged for each future-
year modeling scenario. 
CAMx requires detailed emissions inventories containing temporally allocated 
emissions for each grid-cell in the modeling domain for each species being simulated.  The 
previously described annual emission inventories were preprocessed into model-ready inputs 
through the SMOKE emissions preprocessing system.  Meteorological inputs reflecting 2005 
conditions across the contiguous U.S. were derived from Version 5 of the Mesoscale Model 
(MM5).  These inputs included horizontal wind components (i.e., speed and direction), 
temperature, moisture, vertical diffusion rates, and rainfall rates for each grid cell in each 
vertical layer.  Details of the annual 2005 MM5 modeling are provided in the Air Quality 
Modeling TSD. 
The lateral boundary and initial species concentrations are provided by a three-
dimensional global atmospheric chemistry and transport model (GEOS-CHEM).  The lateral 
boundary species concentrations varied with height and time (every 3 hours).  Terrain 
elevations and land use information were obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey database 
at 10 km resolution and aggregated to the roughly 36 km horizontal resolution used for this 
CAMx application.  The development of model inputs is discussed in greater detail in the Air 
Quality Modeling TSD, which is available in the docket for this rule.  
4.1.1.4 Air Quality Model Evaluation 
 An operational model performance evaluation for ozone and PM2.5 and its related 
speciated components (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, elemental carbon, organic carbon) was performed 
to estimate the ability of the CAMx modeling system to replicate 2005 base year 
concentrations.  This evaluation principally comprises statistical assessments of model 
predictions versus observations paired in time and space on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis 
  
 
 
 60 
depending on the sampling period of measured data.  Details on the evaluation methodology 
and the calculation of performance statistics are provided in the Air Quality Modeling TSD.  
Overall, the model performance statistics for ozone, sulfate, and nitrate from the CAMx 2005 
simulation are within or close to the ranges found in other recent applications. The 
normalized mean bias for 8-hour daily maximum ozone concentrations was -2.9 percent and 
the normalized mean error was 13.2 percent for the months of May through September 2005, 
based on an aggregate of all observed-predicted pairs within the 12 km modeling domain. 
The two PM2.5 species that are most relevant for today’s proposal are sulfate and nitrate.  For 
the summer months of June though August, when observed sulfate concentrations are highest 
in the East, the model predictions of 24-hour average sulfate were lower than the 
corresponding measured values by 7 percent at urban sites and by 9 to 10 percent at rural 
sites in the IMPROVE12 and CASTNet13 monitoring networks, respectively.  For the winter 
months of December through February, when observed nitrate concentrations are highest in 
the East, the model predictions of 24-hour average particulate nitrate were lower than the 
corresponding measured values by 12 percent at urban sites and by 4 percent at rural sites in 
the IMPROVE monitoring network.  The model performance statistics by season for ozone 
and PM2.5 component species are provided in the Air Quality Modeling TSD.   These model 
performance results give us confidence that our applications of CAMx using this 2005 
modeling platform provide a scientifically credible approach for assessing ozone and PM2.5 
concentrations for the purposes of the Transport Rule.

4.2 Results for PM2.5 and Ozone 
4.2.1 Converting CAMx PM2.5 Outputs to Benefits Inputs 
 CAMx generates predictions of hourly PM2.5 species concentrations for every grid.  
The species include a primary fraction and several secondary particles (e.g., sulfates, nitrates, 
and organics).  PM2.5 is calculated as the sum of the primary and the secondary formed 
particles.  Future-year estimates of PM2.5 were calculated using relative reduction factors 
(RRFs) applied to 2005 ambient PM2.5 species concentrations.  Gridded fields of species 
concentrations were created by interpolating ambient data from the PM2.5 speciation network 
and IMPROVE data.  The ambient data were interpolated to the 36 km and 12 km grid 
resolutions. 
 The procedures for determining the RRFs are similar to those in EPA guidance for 
modeling the PM2.5 standard (EPA, 2007).  This guidance recommends that model 
predictions be used in a relative sense to estimate changes expected to occur in each PM2.5 
species.  The procedure for calculating future year PM2.5 values is called the Modeled 
Attainment Test Software (MATS).  EPA used this procedure to estimate the ambient 
impacts of the Transport Rule emissions controls.  For the purposes of projecting future 
PM2.5 concentrations for input to the benefits calculations, we applied the MATS procedure 
using the base year 2005 modeling results and each of the results from each of the 2014 base 
case and 2014 control scenario.   In our application of MATS for PM2.5 we used temporally 
scaled speciated PM2.5 monitoring data from 2005 as the set of base-year measured 
concentrations.  Temporal scaling is based on the ratios of model-predicted future case PM2.5 
species concentrations to the corresponding model-predicted 2005 concentrations. Output 
files from this process include both quarterly and annual mean PM2.5 mass concentrations 
which are then manipulated within SAS to produce a BenMAP input file containing 364 
daily values (created by replicating the quarterly mean values for each day of the appropriate 
season). 
 The MATS procedures documented in the Air Quality Modeling TSD are applicable 
for projecting future nonattainment and maintenance sites and downwind receptor areas for 
the transport analysis.  Those procedures are similar as those performed for the PM benefits 
analysis in Chapter 5 with the following exceptions: 
  
 
 
 62 
1) The benefits analysis uses interpolated PM2.5 data that cover all of the grid cells in the 
modeling domain, whereas the nonattainment analysis is performed at each ambient 
monitoring site using measured PM2.5 data (only the species data are interpolated). 
2) The benefits analysis is anchored by the interpolated PM2.5 data from the single year of 
2005, whereas the nonattainment analysis uses design values from three, 3-year periods (i.e., 
2003-2005, 2004-2006, and 2005-2007) at individual monitoring sites. 
4.2.2 PM2.5 Air Quality Results 
Table 4-1 summaries the projected ambient PM2.5 concentrations for the 2014 base 
case and 2014 impacts associated with rule.  This table includes the annual mean 
concentrations averaged across all model grid cells in the East along with the average change 
between the 2014 base and control concentrations.  We also provide the population-weighted 
average that better reflects the baseline levels and predicted changes for more populated 
areas of the East.  This measure , therefore better reflects the potential benefits of these 
predicted changes through exposure changes to the affected populations.  As shown, the 
average annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 across populated areas of the East declines by 
roughly 9.7 percent (or 6.27 µg/m3) in 2014.  The population-weighted average mean 
concentration declined by 11 percent (or 1.21 µg/m3) in 2014. This indicates the rule 
generates greater absolute air quality improvements in more populated, urban areas.

about 20 percent of the U.S. population located in the modeling domain are predicted to 
experience reductions of greater than 1.75 µg/m3.  Furthermore, over 43 percent of this 
population will benefit from reductions in annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of greater than 
1.25 µg/m3 and almost 88 percent will live in areas with reductions of greater than 0.5 µg/m3.

4.2.3 Converting CAMx Outputs to Full-Season Profiles for Benefits Analysis 
 This study extracted hourly, surface-layer ozone concentrations for each grid-cell 
from the standard CAMx output file containing hourly average ozone values.  These model 
predictions are used in conjunction with the observed concentrations obtained from the 
Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) to generate ozone concentrations for the 
entire ozone season.14,15  The predicted changes in ozone concentrations from the future-year 
base case to future-year control scenario serve as inputs to the health and welfare C-R 
functions of the benefits analysis (i.e., BenMAP).   
 
To estimate ozone-related health and welfare effects, full-season ozone data are 
required for every grid cell.  Given available ozone monitoring data, we generated full-
season ozone profiles for each location in the contiguous 48 States in two steps:  (1) we 
combine monitored observations and modeled ozone predictions to interpolate hourly ozone 
concentrations to a grid of 8 km by 8 km population grid-cells, and (2) we converted these 
                                                 
14The ozone season for this analysis is defined as the 5-month period from May to September; however, to 
estimate certain crop yield benefits, the modeling results were extended to include months outside the 5-
month ozone season. 
15 Based on AIRS, there were 961 ozone monitors with sufficient data, i.e., 50 percent or more days reporting at 
least 9 hourly observations per day (8 am to 8 pm) during the ozone season.

full-season hourly ozone profiles to an ozone measure of interest, such as the daily 
average.16,17

16 The 12 km grid squares contain the population data used in the health benefits analysis model, BenMAP.  See 
Chapter 5 for a discussion of this model. 
17This approach is a generalization of planar interpolation that is technically referred to as enhanced Voronoi  
Neighbor Averaging (EVNA) spatial interpolation. 
 This section provides a summary of the predicted ambient ozone concentrations from 
the CAMx model for the 2014 base case and changes associated with the rule.  Table 4-3 
provides those ozone metrics for grid cells in the Eastern U.S. that enter the C-R functions 
for health benefits endpoints.  The population-weighted average reflects the baseline levels 
and predicted changes for more populated areas of the nation.  This measure, therefore, will 
better reflect the potential benefits of these predicted changes through exposure changes to 
these populations.

4.3 Visibility Degradation Estimates  
 Visibility degradation is often directly proportional to decreases in light transmittal in 
the atmosphere.  Scattering and absorption by both gases and particles decrease light 
transmittance.  To quantify changes in visibility, our analysis computes a light-extinction 
coefficient, based on the work of Sisler (1996), which shows the total fraction of light that is 
decreased per unit distance.  This coefficient accounts for the scattering and absorption of 
light by both particles and gases, and accounts for the higher extinction efficiency of fine 
particles compared to coarse particles.  Fine particles with significant light-extinction 
efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon (soot), and soil 
(Sisler, 1996). 
Based upon the light-extinction coefficient, we also calculated a unitless visibility 
index, called a “deciview,” which is used in the valuation of visibility.  The deciview metric 
provides a scale for perceived visual changes over the entire range of conditions, from clear 
  
 
 
 68 
to hazy.  Under many scenic conditions, the average person can generally perceive a change 
of one deciview.  The higher the deciview value, the worse the visibility.  Thus, an 
improvement in visibility is a decrease in deciview value.     
 Table 4-4 provides the visibility improvements, measured in annual average 
deciviews,  expected to occur in the Eastern and Western U.S. As shown, Class I visibility 
regions in the Eastern U.S., including such regions as the Great Smoky Mountains and 
Shenandoah, are expected to see significant improvements in visibility.  By 2014, such 
regions in the Eastern U.S. are expected to see improvements of over 1 deciview (9 percent), 
and such regions in the Western U.S. are expected to see improvements of over 0.04 
deciviews (or less than 1 percent).

CHAPTER 5  
   BENEFITS ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
Synopsis 
 
This chapter contains a subset of the estimated health and welfare benefits of the 
proposed Transport Rule remedy in 2014. This rule is expected to yield significant reductions in 
SO2 and NOx from EGUs, which in turn would lower overall ambient levels of PM2.5 and ozone 
across much of the eastern U.S. In this chapter we quantify the health and welfare benefits 
resulting from these air quality improvements.  
We estimate the monetized benefits of the proposed remedy to be $120 billion to $290 
billion at a 3% discount rate and $110 billion to $270 billion at a 7% discount rate in 2014.  The 
benefits of the alternative remedies may be found in the benefit-cost comparison chapter. All 
estimates are in 2006$. We estimate the benefits of the proposed remedy using modeled changes 
in ambient pollution concentrations while the benefits of the alternate remedies are based on a 
benefit per ton approach described below. This benefits analysis accounts for both decreases and 
increases in emissions across the country resulting from aspects of the proposed provisions of the 
rule from reductions in NOx and SO2. These estimates omit the benefits from several important 
categories, including ecosystem benefits and the direct health benefits from reducing exposure to 
NO2 and SO2 due to time constraints. While not quantified here, because the level of SO2 and 
NOx emission reductions in 2012 exceed those in 2014, we expect the total benefits in 2012 to 
exceed those in 2014.  
 
5.1 Overview 
 
This chapter contains a subset of the estimated health and welfare benefits of the 
proposed and alternate rule remedies for the Transport Rule in 2014. The Transport Rule is 
expected to yield significant aggregate reductions in SO2 and NOx from EGUs, which in turn 
would lower overall ambient levels of PM2.5 and ozone across much of the eastern U.S.  The 
analysis in this chapter aims to characterize the benefits of these air quality changes by 
answering two key questions:  
1. What are the health and welfare effects of changes in ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) 
and ozone air quality resulting from reductions in precursors including NOx and SO2? 
2. What is the economic value of these effects? 
In this analysis we consider an array of health and welfare impacts attributable to changes 
  
71 
 
 
in PM2.5 and ozone air quality. The 2009 PM2.5 Integrated Science Assessment (U.S. EPA, 
2009d) and the 2006 ozone criteria document (U.S. EPA, 2006a) identify the human health 
effects associated with these ambient pollutants, which include premature mortality and a variety 
of morbidity effects associated with acute and chronic exposures. PM welfare effects include 
visibility impairment and materials damage. Ozone welfare effects include damages to 
agricultural and forestry sectors. NOx welfare effects include aquatic and terrestrial acidification 
and nutrient enrichment (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  SO2 welfare effects include aquatic and terrestrial 
acidification and increased mercury methylation (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Though models exist for 
quantifying these ecosystem impacts, time and resource constraints precluded us from 
quantifying most of those effects in this analysis.  
 
Table 5-1 summarizes the total monetized benefits of the proposed remedy in 2014.  This 
table reflects the economic value of the change in PM2.5 and ozone-related human health impacts 
occurring as a result of the proposed and alternate Transport Rule.  
Table 5-2 summarizes the human health and welfare benefits categories contained within 
the primary benefits estimate, those categories that were unquantified due to limited data or time.

A For notational purposes, unquantified benefits are indicated with a “B” to represent the sum of 
additional monetary benefits and disbenefits. Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these 
endpoints, and as such, these benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were 
able to quantify. A detailed listing of unquantified health and welfare effects is provided in Table 5-2. 
Estimates here are subject to uncertainties discussed further in the body of the document 
B Rounded to two significant figures.  
 
The benefits analysis in this chapter relies on an array of data inputs—including air 
quality modeling, health impact functions and valuation estimates among others—which are 
themselves subject to uncertainty and may also in turn contribute to the overall uncertainty in 
this analysis. As a means of characterizing this uncertainty we employ two primary techniques. 
First, we use Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random sampling error associated with the 
concentration response functions from epidemiological studies and economic valuation 
functions. Second, because this characterization of random statistical error may omit important 
sources of uncertainty we also employ the results of an expert elicitation on the relationship 
between premature mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentration (Roman et al., 2008); this 
provides additional insight into the likelihood of different outcomes and about the state of 
knowledge regarding the benefits estimates. Both approaches have different strengths and 
weaknesses, which are fully described in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
Given that reductions in premature mortality dominate the size of the overall monetized 
benefits, more focus on uncertainty in mortality-related benefits gives us greater confidence in 
our uncertainty characterization surrounding total benefits. Certain EPA RIA’s including the 
2008 Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008a) contained a suite of sensitivity analyses, only 
  
73 
 
 
some of which we include here due in part to time constraints. In particular, these analyses 
characterized the sensitivity of the monetized benefits to the specification of alternate cessation 
lags and income growth adjustment factors. The estimated benefits increased or decreased in 
proportion to the specification of alternate income growth adjustments and cessation lags, 
making it possible for readers to infer the sensitivity of the results in this RIA to these 
parameters by referring to the PM NAAQS RIA (2006d) and Ozone NAAQS RIA (2008a).  
For example, the use of an alternate lag structure would change the PM2.5-related 
mortality benefits discounted at 3% discounted by between 10.4% and –27%; when discounted 
at 7%, these benefits change by between 31% and -49%. When applying higher and lower 
income growth adjustments, the monetary value of PM2.5 and ozone-related premature changes 
between 30% and -10%; the value of chronic endpoints change between 5% and -2% and the 
value of acute endpoints change between 6% and -7%.   
Below we include a new analysis (Figures 5-19 to 5-21) in which we bin the estimated 
number of avoided PM2.5-related premature mortalities resulting from the implementation of the 
Transport Rule according to the projected 2014 baseline PM2.5 air quality levels. This 
presentation is consistent with our approach to applying PM2.5 mortality risk coefficients that 
have not been adjusted to incorporate an assumed threshold.  The very large proportion of the 
avoided PM-related impacts we estimate in this analysis occur among populations exposed at or 
above the LML of each study, increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. 
Approximately 80% of the avoided impacts occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 
µg/m3 (the LML of the Laden et al. 2006 study); about 97% occur at or above an annual mean 
PM2.5 level of 7.5 µg/m3 (the LML of the Pope et al. 2002 study). As we model mortality impacts 
among populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of each 
study our confidence in the results diminishes. However, the analysis below confirms that the 
great majority of the impacts occur at or above each study’s LML.

A In addition to primary economic endpoints, there are a number of biological responses that have been associated 
with PM health effects including morphological changes and altered host defense mechanisms.  The public health 
impact of these biological responses may be partly represented by our quantified endpoints. 
B Cohort estimates are designed to examine the effects of long term exposures to ambient pollution, but relative risk 
estimates may also incorporate some effects due to shorter term exposures (see Kunzli et al., 2001 for a discussion of 
this issue). While some of the effects of short term exposure are likely to be captured by the cohort estimates, there 
may be additional premature mortality from short term PM exposure not captured in the cohort estimates included in 
the primary analysis. 
C May result in benefits or disbenefits. 
  
The benefits analysis presented in this chapter incorporates an array of policy and technical 
changes that the Agency has adopted since the publication of the benefits chapter accompanying 
the promulgated CAIR in 2005 (U.S. EPA, 2005): 
 
1. Incorporation of additional long-term PM mortality studies. The 2005 CAIR analysis 
quantified PM-related mortality using a C-R function drawn the extended analysis of 
American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported in Pope et al. (2002). In this analysis 
we complement this estimate with a C-R function drawn from the Laden et al. (2006) 
reanalysis of the Harvard Six Cities (H6C) cohort. Rather than estimating PM-related 
  
76 
 
 
mortality using a single estimate, we now report two core estimates based on these ACS 
and H6C studies.  
 
2. Inclusion of twelve PM-mortality estimates based on EPA’s expert elicitation study. As a 
means of characterizing uncertainty in the PM-mortality relationship, in 2005 EPA 
undertook an expert elicitation (Roman et al., 2008). The 2005 CAIR analysis included 
the results of the pilot expert elicitation. This analysis presents PM-mortality estimates 
based on the 12 risk estimates derived from the final elicitation.18 
 
3. Quantification of short-term ozone mortality. The 2005 CAIR analysis considered short-
term ozone mortality in a sensitivity analysis. Consistent with recommendations from the 
2008 National Academy of Sciences report (NAS), we incorporate short-term ozone 
mortality estimates in our primary benefits estimate (NRC, 2008).  
 
4. Use of a revised Value of Statistical Life (VSL). The Agency continues to update its 
guidance on valuing mortality risk reductions and until a final report is available, EPA 
now uses a distribution of VSL as recommended in EPA’s guidance. The mean value of 
this distribution is $6.3 million (2006$). We discuss this issue in further depth below.  
 
5. Projection of baseline mortality rates. Beginning in late 2005, after the completion of the 
final CAIR benefits analysis, the Agency began projecting into the future county-level 
mortality rates (Abt, 2005). Mortality rates are a key input to the calculation of air 
pollution-related premature mortality. Using projected rates generally results in a lower 
number of estimated excess mortality because of projected increases in life expectancy 
and concurrent reductions in risk of death at younger ages.  
In general, for a given air quality change, the first four methodological changes increase, 
and the fifth decreases, the overall magnitude of the health impacts and monetized benefits 
compared to the approach used for the 2005 CAIR benefits analysis. 
 
5.2 Benefits Analysis Methods  
We follow a “damage-function” approach in calculating total benefits of the modeled 
changes in environmental quality.  This approach estimates changes in individual health and 
                                                 
18 As we discuss below, the characterization of PM‐related mortality using this expert elicitation responds in 
part to 2002 National Academy Sciences (NAS) recommendations regarding the propagation of uncertainty 
characterization throughout the benefits chapter. 
  
77 
 
 
welfare endpoints (specific effects that can be associated with changes in air quality) and assigns 
values to those changes assuming independence of the individual values.  Total benefits are 
calculated simply as the sum of the values for all non-overlapping health and welfare endpoints. 
The “damage-function” approach is the standard method for assessing costs and benefits of 
environmental quality programs and has been used in several recent published analyses (Levy et 
al., 2009; Hubbell et al., 2009; Tagaris et al., 2009). 
To assess economic value in a damage-function framework, the changes in 
environmental quality must be translated into effects on people or on the things that people 
value.  In some cases, the changes in environmental quality can be directly valued, as is the case 
for changes in visibility.  In other cases, such as for changes in ozone and PM, a health and 
welfare impact analysis must first be conducted to convert air quality changes into effects that 
can be assigned dollar values. 
For the purposes of this RIA, the health impacts analysis (HIA) is limited to those health 
effects that are directly linked to ambient levels of air pollution and specifically to those linked 
to ozone and PM.  There may be other, indirect health impacts associated with implementing 
emissions controls, such as occupational health impacts for coal miners.   
The welfare impacts analysis is limited to changes in the environment that have a direct 
impact on human welfare.  For this analysis, we are limited by the available data to examine 
impacts of changes in visibility in Class 1 areas.  We also provide qualitative discussions of the 
impact of changes in other environmental and ecological effects, for example, changes in 
deposition of nitrogen and sulfur to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but we are unable to place 
an economic value on these changes due to time and resource limitations. 
We note at the outset that EPA rarely has the time or resources to perform extensive new 
research to measure directly either the health outcomes or their values for regulatory analyses.  
Thus, similar to Kunzli et al. (2000) and other recent health impact analyses, our estimates are 
based on the best available methods of benefits transfer.  Benefits transfer is the science and art 
of adapting primary research from similar contexts to obtain the most accurate measure of 
benefits for the environmental quality change under analysis.  Adjustments are made for the level 
of environmental quality change, the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the 
affected population, and other factors to improve the accuracy and robustness of benefits 
estimates. 
 
 
  
78 
 
 
5.2.1 Health Impact Assessment  
 
The Health Impact Assessment (HIA) quantifies the changes in the incidence of adverse 
health impacts resulting from changes in human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone air quality. HIAs 
are a well-established approach for estimating the retrospective or prospective change in adverse 
health impacts expected to result from population-level changes in exposure to pollutants (Levy 
et al. 2009). PC-based tools such as the environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program 
(BenMAP) can systematize health impact analyses by applying a database of key input 
parameters, including health impact functions and population projections. Analysts have applied 
the HIA approach to estimate human health impacts resulting from hypothetical changes in 
pollutant levels (Hubbell et al. 2005; Davidson et al. 2007, Tagaris et al. 2009). EPA and others 
have relied upon this method to predict future changes in health impacts expected to result from 
the implementation of regulations affecting air quality (U.S. EPA, 2008a). 
The HIA approach used in this analysis involves three basic steps: (1) utilizing CAMx-
generated projections of PM2.5 and ozone air quality and estimating the change in the spatial 
distribution of the ambient air quality; (2) determining the subsequent change in population-level 
exposure; (3) calculating health impacts by applying concentration-response relationships drawn 
from the epidemiological literature (Hubbell et al. 2009) to this change in population exposure.  
 
A typical health impact function might look as follows: 
  
where y0 is the baseline incidence rate for the health endpoint being quantified (for 
example, a health impact function quantifying changes in mortality would use the baseline, or 
background, mortality rate for the given population of interest); Pop is the population affected by 
the change in air quality; x is the change in air quality; and β is the effect coefficient drawn 
from the epidemiological study. Tools such as BenMAP can systematize the HIA calculation 
process, allowing users to draw upon a library of existing air quality monitoring data, population 
data and health impact functions.  
Figure 5-1 provides a simplified overview of this approach.

5.2.2 Economic Valuation of Health Impacts 
 
After quantifying the change in adverse health impacts, the final step is to estimate the 
economic value of these avoided impacts. The appropriate economic value for a change in a 
health effect depends on whether the health effect is viewed ex ante (before the effect has 
occurred) or ex post (after the effect has occurred). Reductions in ambient concentrations of air 
pollution generally lower the risk of future adverse health effects by a small amount for a large 
population. The appropriate economic measure is therefore ex ante Willingness to Pay (WTP) 
for changes in risk. However, epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the relative 
risks of a particular health effect avoided due to a reduction in air pollution. A convenient way to 
use this data in a consistent framework is to convert probabilities to units of avoided statistical 
incidences. This measure is calculated by dividing individual WTP for a risk reduction by the 
related observed change in risk. For example, suppose a measure is able to reduce the risk of 
premature mortality from 2 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000 (a reduction of 1 in 10,000). If individual 
WTP for this risk reduction is $100, then the WTP for an avoided statistical premature mortality 
amounts to $1 million ($100/0.0001 change in risk). Using this approach, the size of the affected 
population is automatically taken into account by the number of incidences predicted by 
  
80 
 
 
epidemiological studies applied to the relevant population. The same type of calculation can 
produce values for statistical incidences of other health endpoints.  
For some health effects, such as hospital admissions, WTP estimates are generally not 
available. In these cases, we use the cost of treating or mitigating the effect as a primary 
estimate. For example, for the valuation of hospital admissions we use the avoided medical costs 
as an estimate of the value of avoiding the health effects causing the admission. These cost of 
illness (COI) estimates generally (although not in every case) understate the true value of 
reductions in risk of a health effect. They tend to reflect the direct expenditures related to 
treatment but not the value of avoided pain and suffering from the health effect. 
We use the BenMAP model (Abt Associates, 2008) to estimate the health impacts and 
monetized health benefits for the proposed remedy.  Figure 5-2 below shows the data inputs and 
outputs for the BenMAP model.

5.2.3 Benefit Per-Ton Estimates  
 
Benefit per-ton (BPT) estimates quantify the health impacts and monetized human health 
benefits of an incremental change in air pollution precursor emissions. In situations when we are 
unable to perform air quality modeling because of resource or time constraints, this approach can 
provide a reliable estimate of the benefits of emission reduction scenarios. EPA has used the 
benefit per-ton technique in previous RIAs, including the recent Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 
2008) and NO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010b).  Time constraints prevented the Agency from 
modeling the air quality changes resulting from either the intrastate and direct control remedies 
or the more and less stringent SO2 caps and so we estimate a subset of these health benefits using 
PM2.5 benefit per-ton estimates. The assessment of the alternate scenarios omits ozone-related 
benefits for two reasons. First, the overall level of ozone-related benefits in the modeled case is

relatively small compared to those associated with PM2.5 reductions (see table 5-17 below), due 
in part to the fairly modest summer time NOx emission reductions under this scenario. The level 
of summertime NOx emission reductions of the alternate scenarios are very similar to the 
modeled scenario, suggesting that the omission of ozone-related impacts would not greatly 
influence the overall level of benefits. Second, the complex non-linear chemistry of ozone 
formation introduces uncertainty to the development and application of a benefit per ton 
estimate. Taken together, these factors argued against developing an ozone benefit per ton 
estimate for this RIA.   
For this analysis, EPA applies PM2.5 BPT estimates that are methodologically consistent 
with those reported in Fann et al. (2009), but have been adjusted for this analysis to better match 
the spatial distribution of air quality changes projected for the Transport Rule. To derive the BPT 
estimates for this analysis, we: 
1. Quantified the PM2.5 -related human and monetized health benefits of the SO2 emission 
reductions of the proposed remedy. We first quantified the health impacts and monetized 
benefits of total PM2.5 mass formed from the SO2 reductions of the proposed remedy, 
allowing us to isolate the PM air quality impacts from SO2 reductions alone.19 This 
procedure allowed us to develop PM2.5 BPT estimates that quantified the PM2.5-related 
benefits of incremental changes in SO2 emissions. Because reductions in NOx emissions 
are relatively small in each scenario, and previous EPA modeling indicates that PM2.5 
formation is less sensitive to NOx emission reductions on a per-µg/m3 basis (Fann et al, 
2009), we did not quantify the NOx-related PM2.5 changes. 
 
2. Divided the health impacts and monetized benefits by the emission reduction. This 
calculation yields BPT estimates for PM-related SO2. 
 
The resulting BPT estimates were then multiplied by the projected SO2 emission reductions 
for the Direct Control and Interstate Trading scenarios to produce an estimate of the PM- and 
                                                 
19 The Transport Rule includes both SO2 and NOx emissions reductions.  In general SO2 is a precursor to particulate 
sulfate and NOx is a precursor to particulate nitrate.  However, there are also several interactions between the PM2.5 
precursors which cannot be easily quantified.  For example, under conditions in which SO2 levels are reduced by a 
substantial margin, "nitrate replacement" may occur.  This occurs when particulate ammonium sulfate concentrations 
are reduced, thereby freeing up excess gaseous ammonia.  The excess ammonia is then available to react with 
gaseous nitric acid to form particulate nitrate.  The impact of nitrate replacement is also affected by concurrent NOx 
reductions.  NOx reductions can lead to decreases in nitrate, which competes with the process of nitrate replacement. 
 NOx reductions can also lead to reductions in photochemical by-products which can reduce both particulate sulfate 
and secondary organic carbon PM concentrations.  Due to the complex nature of these interactions, EPA performed a 
sensitivity modeling analysis in which only SO2 emissions were reduced.  We calculated benefits from this air 
quality modeling run to generate an SO2-only benefit per ton estimate.  The results of the SO2-only sensitivity run 
may be found in the EPA Benefits TSD [Docket  No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0491] 
  
83 
 
 
ozone-related health impacts and monetized benefits. There is no analogous approach for 
estimating a BPT for visibility, and so the benefits of the alternative remedies omit this important 
monetized benefit.   
 
5.3 Uncertainty Characterization 
 
In any complex analysis using estimated parameters and inputs from numerous models, 
there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty and this analysis is no exception.  As outlined 
both in this and preceding chapters, many inputs were used to derive the estimate of benefits for 
the proposed remedy, including emission inventories, air quality models (with their associated 
parameters and inputs), epidemiological health effect estimates, estimates of values (both from 
WTP and COI studies), population estimates, income estimates, and estimates of the future state 
of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human behavior).  Each of these inputs may be 
uncertain and, depending on its role in the benefits analysis, may have a disproportionately large 
impact on estimates of total benefits.  For example, emissions estimates are used in the first stage 
of the analysis.  As such, any uncertainty in emissions estimates will be propagated through the 
entire analysis.  When compounded with uncertainty in later stages, small uncertainties in 
emission levels can lead to large impacts on total benefits. 
The National Research Council (NRC) (2002, 2008) highlighted the need for EPA to 
conduct rigorous quantitative analysis of uncertainty in its benefits estimates and to present these 
estimates to decision makers in ways that foster an appropriate appreciation of their inherent 
uncertainty. In general, the NRC concluded that EPA’s general methodology for calculating the 
benefits of reducing air pollution is reasonable and informative in spite of inherent uncertainties. 
 Since the publication of these reports, EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) continues to 
make progress toward the goal of characterizing the aggregate impact of uncertainty in key 
modeling elements on both health incidence and benefits estimates in two key ways: Monte 
Carlo analysis and expert-derived concentration-response functions.  In this analysis, we use 
both of these two methods to assess uncertainty quantitatively, as well as provide a qualitative 
assessment for those aspects that we are unable to address quantitatively.   
 
First, we used Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random sampling error associated 
with the concentration response functions from epidemiological studies and random effects 
modeling to characterize both sampling error and variability across the economic valuation 
functions. Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling from distributions of parameters to 
  
84 
 
 
characterize the effects of uncertainty on output variables, such as incidence of premature 
mortality. Specifically, we used Monte Carlo methods to generate confidence intervals around 
the estimated health impact and dollar benefits. The reported standard errors in the 
epidemiological studies determined the distributions for individual effect estimates. 
Second, because characterization of random statistical error omits important sources of 
uncertainty (e.g., in the functional form of the model—e.g., whether or not a threshold may 
exist), we also incorporate the results of an expert elicitation on the relationship between 
premature mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentration (Roman et al., 2008).  Use of the expert 
elicitation and incorporation of the standard errors approaches provide insights into the 
likelihood of different outcomes and about the state of knowledge regarding the benefits 
estimates. However, there are significant unquantified uncertainties present in upstream inputs 
including emission and air quality. Both approaches have different strengths and weaknesses, 
which are fully described in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006).  
In benefit analyses of air pollution regulations conducted to date, the estimated impact of 
reductions in premature mortality has accounted for 85% to 95% of total monetized benefits. 
Therefore, it is particularly important to attempt to characterize the uncertainties associated with 
reductions in premature mortality. The health impact functions used to estimate avoided 
premature deaths associated with reductions in ozone have associated standard errors that 
represent the statistical errors around the effect estimates in the underlying epidemiological 
studies. In our results, we report credible intervals based on these standard errors, reflecting the 
uncertainty in the estimated change in incidence of avoided premature deaths. We also provide 
multiple estimates, to reflect model uncertainty between alternative study designs.  
For premature mortality associated with exposure to PM, we follow the same approach 
used in the RIA for 2006 PM NAAQS (U.S. EPA, 2006), presenting two empirical estimates of 
premature deaths avoided, and a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation 
study. Even these multiple characterizations, including confidence intervals, omit the 
contribution to overall uncertainty of uncertainty in air quality changes, baseline incidence rates, 
populations exposed and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. Furthermore, 
the approach presented here does not yet include methods for addressing correlation between 
input parameters and the identification of reasonable upper and lower bounds for input 
distributions characterizing uncertainty in additional model elements. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the overall 
uncertainty in the estimates. This information should be interpreted within the context of the 
  
85 
 
 
larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. 
In 2006 the EPA requested an NAS study to evaluate the extent to which the epidemiological 
literature to that point improved the understanding of ozone-related mortality. The NAS found 
that short-term ozone exposure was likely to contribute to ozone-related mortality (NRC, 2008) 
and issued a series of recommendations to EPA, including that the Agency should: 
 
1. Present multiple short-term ozone mortality estimates, including those based on multi-
city analyses such as the National Morbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study 
(NMMAPS) as well as meta-analytic studies. 
2. Report additional risk metrics, including the percentage of baseline mortality attributable 
to short-term exposure. 
3. Remove reference to a no-causal relationship between ozone exposure and premature 
mortality. 
 
 The quantification and presentation of ozone-related premature mortality in this chapter 
is responsive to these NRC recommendations and generally consistent with EPA’s recent ozone 
reconsideration analysis (U.S. EPA, 2010a).  
 Some key sources of uncertainty in each stage of both the PM and ozone health impact 
assessment are the following: 
 gaps in scientific data and inquiry; 
 variability in estimated relationships, such as epidemiological effect estimates, 
introduced through differences in study design and statistical modeling; 
 errors in measurement and projection for variables such as population growth rates; 
 errors due to misspecification of model structures, including the use of surrogate 
variables, such as using PM10 when PM2.5 is not available, excluded variables, and 
simplification of complex functions; and 
 biases due to omissions or other research limitations. 
 
In Table 5-3 we summarize some of the key uncertainties in the benefits analysis.  
 
  
86 
 
 
Table 5-3.  Primary Sources of Uncertainty in the Benefits Analysis 
 
1.  Uncertainties Associated with Impact Functions 
- The value of the ozone or PM effect estimate in each impact function. 
- Application of a single impact function to pollutant changes and populations in all locations. 
- Similarity of future-year impact functions to current impact functions.  
- Correct functional form of each impact function.  
- Extrapolation of effect estimates beyond the range of ozone or PM concentrations observed in the 
source epidemiological study.  
- Application of impact functions only to those subpopulations matching the original study population. 
2.  Uncertainties Associated with CAMx-Modeled Ozone and PM Concentrations  
- Responsiveness of the models to changes in precursor emissions from the control policy. 
- Projections of future levels of precursor emissions, especially ammonia and crustal materials. 
- Lack of ozone and PM2.5 monitors in all rural areas requires extrapolation of observed ozone data from 
urban to rural areas. 
3.  Uncertainties Associated with PM Mortality Risk 
- Limited scientific literature supporting a direct biological mechanism for observed epidemiological 
evidence. 
- Direct causal agents within the complex mixture of PM have not been identified. 
- The extent to which adverse health effects are associated with low-level exposures that occur many 
times in the year versus peak exposures. 
- The extent to which effects reported in the long-term exposure studies are associated with historically 
higher levels of PM rather than the levels occurring during the period of study. 
- Reliability of the PM2.5 monitoring data in reflecting actual PM2.5 exposures. 
4.  Uncertainties Associated with Possible Lagged Effects 
- The portion of the PM-related long-term exposure mortality effects associated with changes in annual 
PM levels that would occur in a single year is uncertain as well as the portion that might occur in 
subsequent years. 
5.  Uncertainties Associated with Baseline Incidence Rates 
- Some baseline incidence rates are not location specific (e.g., those taken from studies) and therefore 
may not accurately represent the actual location-specific rates. 
- Current baseline incidence rates may not approximate well baseline incidence rates in 2014. 
- Projected population and demographics may not represent well future-year population and 
demographics. 
6.  Uncertainties Associated with Economic Valuation 
- Unit dollar values associated with health and welfare endpoints are only estimates of mean WTP and 
therefore have uncertainty surrounding them. 
- Mean WTP (in constant dollars) for each type of risk reduction may differ from current estimates 
because of differences in income or other factors. 
7.  Uncertainties Associated with Aggregation of Monetized Benefits 
- Health and welfare benefits estimates are limited to the available impact functions.  Thus, 
unquantified or unmonetized benefits are not included.

5.4 Benefits Analysis Data Inputs 
 
In Figure 5-2, we summarized the key data inputs to the health impact and economic 
valuation estimate. Below we summarize the data sources for each of these inputs, including 
demographic projections, effect coefficients, incidence rates and economic valuation. We 
indicate where we have updated key data inputs since the 2005 CAIR benefits analysis. 
 
5.4.1 Demographic Data  
 
Quantified and monetized human health impacts depend on the demographic characteristics 
of the population, including age, location, and income.  We use projections based on economic 
forecasting models developed by Woods and Poole, Inc (Woods and Poole, 2008).  The Woods 
and Poole (WP) database contains county-level projections of population by age, sex, and race 
out to 2030.  Projections in each county are determined simultaneously with every other county 
in the United States to take into account patterns of economic growth and migration.  The sum of 
growth in county-level populations is constrained to equal a previously determined national 
population growth, based on Bureau of Census estimates (Hollman et al., 2000).  According to 
WP, linking county-level growth projections together and constraining to a national-level total 
growth avoids potential errors introduced by forecasting each county independently.  County 
projections are developed in a four-stage process:   
 
1. First, national-level variables such as income, employment, and populations are 
forecasted.   
 
2. Second, employment projections are made for 172 economic areas defined by the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, using an “export-base” approach, which relies on linking 
industrial-sector production of non-locally consumed production items, such as outputs 
from mining, agriculture, and manufacturing with the national economy.  The export-
based approach requires estimation of demand equations or calculation of historical 
growth rates for output and employment by sector.   
 
3. Third, population is projected for each economic area based on net migration rates 
derived from employment opportunities and following a cohort-component method based 
on fertility and mortality in each area.   
 
4. Fourth, employment and population projections are repeated for counties, using the 
economic region totals as bounds.  The age, sex, and race distributions for each region or 
  
88 
 
 
county are determined by aging the population by single year of age by sex and race for 
each year through 2014 based on historical rates of mortality, fertility, and migration. 
 
5.4.2 Effect Coefficients 
 
The first step in selecting effect coefficients is to identify the health endpoints to be 
quantified. We base our selection of health endpoints on consistency with EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessments (which replace the Criteria Document), with input and advice from the 
EPA Science Advisory Board - Health Effects Subcommittee (SAB-HES), a scientific review 
panel specifically established to provide advice on the use of the scientific literature in 
developing benefits analyses for air pollution regulations (http://www.epa.gov/sab/). In general, 
we follow a weight of evidence approach, based on the biological plausibility of effects, 
availability of concentration-response functions from well conducted peer-reviewed 
epidemiological studies, cohesiveness of results across studies, and a focus on endpoints 
reflecting public health impacts (like hospital admissions) rather than physiological responses 
(such as changes in clinical measures like Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)).  
There are several types of data that can support the determination of types and magnitude 
of health effects associated with air pollution exposures. These sources of data include 
toxicological studies (including animal and cellular studies), human clinical trials, and 
observational epidemiology studies. All of these data sources provide important contributions to 
the weight of evidence surrounding a particular health impact. However, only epidemiology 
studies provide direct concentration-response relationships which can be used to evaluate 
population-level impacts of reductions in ambient pollution levels in a health impact assessment. 
For the data-derived estimates, we relied on the published scientific literature to ascertain 
the relationship between PM and adverse human health effects. We evaluated epidemiological 
studies using the selection criteria summarized in Table 5-4. These criteria include consideration 
of whether the study was peer-reviewed, the match between the pollutant studied and the 
pollutant of interest, the study design and location, and characteristics of the study population, 
among other considerations. The selection of C-R functions for the benefits analysis is guided by 
the goal of achieving a balance between comprehensiveness and scientific defensibility. In 
general, the use of results from more than a single study can provide a more robust estimate of 
the relationship between a pollutant and a given health effect. However, there are often 
differences between studies examining the same endpoint, making it difficult to pool the results 
in a consistent manner. For example, studies may examine different pollutants or different age 
groups. For this reason, we consider very carefully the set of studies available examining each 
  
89 
 
 
endpoint and select a consistent subset that provides a good balance of population coverage and 
match with the pollutant of interest. In many cases, either because of a lack of multiple studies, 
consistency problems, or clear superiority in the quality or comprehensiveness of one study over 
others, a single published study is selected as the basis of the effect estimate.  
  
90 
 
 
Table 5-4. Criteria Used when Selecting C-R functions 
 
Consideration Comments 
Peer-Reviewed 
Research 
Peer-reviewed research is preferred to research that has not undergone the peer-review 
process. 
Study Type 
Among studies that consider chronic exposure (e.g., over a year or longer), prospective 
cohort studies are preferred over ecological studies because they control for important 
individual-level confounding variables that cannot be controlled for in ecological studies.  
Study Period 
Studies examining a relatively longer period of time (and therefore having more data) are 
preferred, because they have greater statistical power to detect effects.  More recent studies 
are also preferred because of possible changes in pollution mixes, medical care, and 
lifestyle over time.  However, when there are only a few studies available, studies from all 
years will be included. 
Population Attributes 
The most technically appropriate measures of benefits would be based on impact functions 
that cover the entire sensitive population but allow for heterogeneity across age or other 
relevant demographic factors.  In the absence of effect estimates specific to age, sex, 
preexisting condition status, or other relevant factors, it may be appropriate to select effect 
estimates that cover the broadest population to match with the desired outcome of the 
analysis, which is total national-level health impacts.  When available, multi-city studies 
are preferred to single city studies because they provide a more generalizable 
representation of the C-R function. 
Study Size 
Studies examining a relatively large sample are preferred because they generally have 
more power to detect small magnitude effects.  A large sample can be obtained in several 
ways, either through a large population or through repeated observations on a smaller 
population (e.g., through a symptom diary recorded for a panel of asthmatic children). 
Study Location 
U.S. studies are more desirable than non-U.S. studies because of potential differences in 
pollution characteristics, exposure patterns, medical care system, population behavior, and 
lifestyle. 
Pollutants Included in 
Model 
When modeling the effects of ozone and PM (or other pollutant combinations) jointly, it is 
important to use properly specified impact functions that include both pollutants.  Using 
single-pollutant models in cases where both pollutants are expected to affect a health 
outcome can lead to double-counting when pollutants are correlated. 
Measure of PM 
For this analysis, impact functions based on PM2.5 are preferred to PM10 because of the 
focus on reducing emissions of PM2.5 precursors, and because air quality modeling was 
conducted for this size fraction of PM.  Where PM2.5 functions are not available, PM10 
functions are used as surrogates, recognizing that there will be potential downward 
(upward) biases if the fine fraction of PM10 is more (less) toxic than the coarse fraction.   
Economically 
Valuable Health 
Effects 
Some health effects, such as forced expiratory volume and other technical measurements 
of lung function, are difficult to value in monetary terms.  These health effects are not 
quantified in this analysis. 
Non-overlapping 
Endpoints 
Although the benefits associated with each individual health endpoint may be analyzed 
separately, care must be exercised in selecting health endpoints to include in the overall 
benefits analysis because of the possibility of double-counting of benefits.  
 
  
91 
 
 
When several effect estimates for a pollutant and a given health endpoint have been 
selected, they are quantitatively combined or pooled to derive a more robust estimate of the 
relationship. The BenMAP Technical Appendices provides details of the procedures used to 
combine multiple impact functions (Abt Associates, 2008). In general, we used fixed or random 
effects models to pool estimates from different studies of the same endpoint. Fixed effects 
pooling simply weights each study’s estimate by the inverse variance, giving more weight to 
studies with greater statistical power (lower variance). Random effects pooling accounts for both 
within-study variance and between-study variability, due, for example, to differences in 
population susceptibility. We used the fixed effects model as our null hypothesis and then 
determined whether the data suggest that we should reject this null hypothesis, in which case we 
would use the random effects model. Pooled impact functions are used to estimate hospital 
admissions and asthma exacerbations. For more details on methods used to pool incidence 
estimates, see the BenMAP Manual Appendices (Abt Associates, 2008), which are available 
with the BenMAP software at http://www.epa.gov/benmap.html. 
Effect estimates selected for a given health endpoint were applied consistently across all 
locations nationwide. This applies to both impact functions defined by a single effect estimate 
and those defined by a pooling of multiple effect estimates. Although the effect estimate may, in 
fact, vary from one location to another (e.g., because of differences in population susceptibilities 
or differences in the composition of PM), location-specific effect estimates are generally not 
available. 
The specific studies from which effect estimates for the primary analysis are drawn are 
included in Table 5-5. We highlight in blue those studies that have been added since the 2005 
CAIR benefits analysis and incorporated into the central benefits estimate. In all cases where 
effect estimates are drawn directly from epidemiological studies, standard errors are used as a 
partial representation of the uncertainty in the size of the effect estimate. Below we provide the 
basis for selecting these studies.

5.4.2.1 PM2.5 Premature Mortality Effect Coefficients 
Both long- and short-term exposures to ambient levels of PM2.5 air pollution have been 
associated with increased risk of premature mortality. The size of the mortality risk estimates 
from epidemiological studies, the serious nature of the effect itself, and the high monetary value 
ascribed to prolonging life make mortality risk reduction the most significant health endpoint 
quantified in this analysis. 
Although a number of uncertainties remain to be addressed by continued research (NRC, 
2002), a substantial body of published scientific literature documents the correlation between 
elevated PM2.5 concentrations and increased mortality rates (U.S. EPA, 2009d). Time-series 
methods have been used to relate short-term (often day-to-day) changes in PM2.5 concentrations 
and changes in daily mortality rates up to several days after a period of elevated PM2.5 
concentrations. Cohort methods have been used to examine the potential relationship between 
community-level PM exposures over multiple years (i.e., long-term exposures) and community-
level annual mortality rates. Researchers have found statistically significant associations between 
PM2.5 and premature mortality using both types of studies. In general, the risk estimates based on 
the cohort studies are larger than those derived from time-series studies. Cohort analyses are 
thought to better capture the full public health impact of exposure to air pollution over time, 
because they account for the effects of long-term exposures and possibly some component of 
short-term exposures (Kunzli et al., 2001; NRC, 2002). This section discusses some of the issues 
surrounding the estimation of PM2.5-related premature mortality. To demonstrate the sensitivity 
of the benefits estimates to the specific sources of information regarding the impact of PM2.5 
exposures on the risk of premature death, we are providing estimates in our results tables based 
on studies derived from the epidemiological literature and from the EPA sponsored expert 
elicitation. The epidemiological studies from which these estimates are drawn are described 
below. The expert elicitation project and the derivation of effect estimates from the expert 
elicitation results are described in the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and Roman et al. (2008). In the 
interest of brevity we do not repeat those details here. However, Figure 5-18 summarizes the 
estimated PM2.5-related premature mortalities avoided using risk estimates drawn from the 
expert elicitation.  
Over a dozen epidemiological studies have found significant associations between 
various measures of long-term exposure to PM and elevated rates of annual mortality, beginning 
with Lave and Seskin (1977). Most of the published studies found positive (but not always 
statistically significant) associations with available PM indices such as total suspended particles 
  
95 
 
 
(TSP). However, exploration of alternative model specifications sometimes raised questions 
about causal relationships (e.g., Lipfert et al., 1989). These early “ecological cross-sectional” 
studies (Lave and Seskin, 1977; Ozkaynak and Thurston, 1987) were criticized for a number of 
methodological limitations, particularly for inadequate control at the individual level for 
variables that are potentially important in causing mortality, such as wealth, smoking, and diet. 
Over the last 17 years, several studies using “prospective cohort” designs have been 
published that appear to be consistent with the earlier body of literature. These new “prospective 
cohort” studies reflect a significant improvement over the earlier work because they include 
individual level information with respect to health status and residence. The most extensive 
analyses have been based on data from two prospective cohort groups, often referred to as the 
Harvard “Six-Cities Study” (Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) and the “American Cancer 
Society or ACS study” (Pope et al., 1995; Pope et al., 2002; Pope et al., 2004, Krewski et al. 
2009); these studies have found consistent relationships between fine particle indicators and 
premature mortality across multiple locations in the United States. A third major data set comes 
from the California-based 7th Day Adventist Study (e.g., Abbey et al., 1999), which reported 
associations between long-term PM exposure and mortality in men. Results from this cohort, 
however, have been inconsistent, and the air quality results are not geographically representative 
of most of the United States, and the lifestyle of the population is not reflective of much of the 
U.S. population. Analysis is also available for a cohort of adult male veterans diagnosed with 
hypertension has been examined (Lipfert et al., 2000; Lipfert et al., 2003, 2006). The 
characteristics of this group differ from the cohorts in the Six-Cities, ACS, and 7th Day 
Adventist studies with respect to income, race, health status, and smoking status. Unlike 
previous long-term analyses, this study found some associations between mortality and ozone 
but found inconsistent results for PM indicators. Because of the selective nature of the 
population in the veteran’s cohort, we have chosen not to include any effect estimates from the 
Lipfert et al. (2000) study in our benefits assessment.  
Given their consistent results and broad geographic coverage, and importance in 
informing the NAAQS development process, the Six-Cities and ACS data have been particularly 
important in benefits analyses. The credibility of these two studies is further enhanced by the fact 
that the initial published studies (Pope et al., 1995 and Dockery et al., 1993) were subject to 
extensive reexamination and reanalysis by an independent team of scientific experts 
commissioned by the Health Effect Institute (HEI) (Krewski et al., 2000). The final results of the 
reanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a Special Panel of the HEI Health Review 
Committee. The results of these reanalyses confirmed and expanded the conclusions of the 
  
96 
 
 
original investigators. While the HEI reexamination lends credibility to the original studies, it 
also highlights sensitivities concerning the relative impact of various pollutants, such as SO2, the 
potential role of education in mediating the association between pollution and mortality, and the 
influence of spatial correlation modeling. Further confirmation and extension of the findings of 
the 1993 Six City Study and the 1995 ACS study were recently completed using more recent air 
quality and a longer follow-up period for the ACS cohort was published over the past several 
years (Pope et al., 2002, 2004; Laden et al., 2006, Krewski et al. 2009). The follow up to the 
Harvard Six City Study both confirmed the effect size from the first analysis and provided 
additional confirmation that reductions in PM2.5 are likely to result in reductions in the risk of 
premature death. This additional evidence stems from the observed reductions in PM2.5 in each 
city during the extended follow-up period. Laden et al. (2006) found that mortality rates 
consistently went down at a rate proportionate to the observed reductions in PM2.5.  
A number of additional analyses have been conducted on the ACS cohort data (Jarrett et 
al., 2009; Pope et al., 2009). These studies have continued to find a strong significant 
relationship between PM2.5 and mortality outcomes and life expectancy. Specifically, much of 
the recent research has suggested a stronger relationship between cardiovascular mortality and 
lung cancer mortality with PM2.5, and a less significant relationship between respiratory-related 
mortality and PM2.5. The extended analyses of the ACS cohort data (Krewski et al. 2009) 
provides additional refinements to the analysis of PM-related mortality by (a) extend the follow-
up period by 2 years to the year 2000, for a total of 18 years; (b) incorporate ecological., or 
neighborhood-level co-variates so as to better estimate personal exposure; (c) perform an 
extensive spatial analysis using land use regression modeling. These additional refinements may 
make this analysis well-suited for the assessment of PM-related mortality for EPA benefits 
analyses.  
In developing and improving the methods for estimating and valuing the potential 
reductions in mortality risk over the years, EPA consulted with the SAB-HES. That panel 
recommended using long-term prospective cohort studies in estimating mortality risk reduction 
(U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999b). This recommendation has been confirmed by a report from the 
National Research Council, which stated that “it is essential to use the cohort studies in benefits 
analysis to capture all important effects from air pollution exposure” (NRC, 2002, p. 108). More 
specifically, the SAB recommended emphasis on the ACS study because it includes a much 
larger sample size and longer exposure interval and covers more locations (e.g., 50 cities 
compared to the Six Cities Study) than other studies of its kind. Because of the refinements in 
the extended follow-up analysis, the SAB-HES recommended using the Pope et al. (2002) study 
  
97 
 
 
as the basis for the primary mortality estimate for adults and suggests that alternate estimates of 
mortality generated using other cohort and time-series studies could be included as part of the 
sensitivity analysis (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004b). The PM NAAQS Risk and Exposure Assessment 
(U.S EPA, 2010) utilized risk coefficients drawn from the Krewski et al. (2009) study. In a 
December of 2009 consultation with the SAB-HES, the Agency proposed utilizing the Krewski 
et al. (2009) extended analysis of the ACS cohort data. The panel is scheduled to issue an 
advisory in early 2010.  
As noted above, since 2004 SAB review, an extended follow-up of the Harvard Six cities 
study has been published (Laden et al., 2006) and in recent RIAs (see for example the SO2 
NAAQS, PM NAAQS, CAIR and Nonroad Diesel RIAs), we have included this estimate of 
mortality impacts based on application of the C-R function derived from this study. We use this 
specific estimate to represent the Six Cities study because it both reflects among the most up-to-
date science and was cited by many of the experts in their elicitation responses. It is clear from 
the expert elicitation that the results published in Laden et al. (2006) are potentially influential, 
and in fact the expert elicitation results encompass within their range the estimates from both the 
Pope et al. (2002) and Laden et al. (2006) studies (see Figure 5-18 below). These are logical 
choices for anchor points in our presentation because, while both studies are well designed and 
peer reviewed, there are strengths and weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for 
using both studies to generate  benefits estimates. 
5.4.2.2 Ozone Premature Mortality Effect Coefficients 
While particulate matter is the criteria pollutant most clearly associated with premature 
mortality, recent research suggests that short-term repeated ozone exposure also likely 
contributes to premature death. The 2006 Ozone Criteria Document found that  “[c]onsistent 
with observed ozone-related increases in respiratory- and cardiovascular-related morbidity, 
several newer multi-city studies, single-city studies, and several meta-analyses of these studies 
have provided relatively strong epidemiologic evidence for associations between short-term 
ozone exposure and all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for the influence of season and 
PM” (U.S. EPA, 2006). The epidemiologic data are also supported by recent experimental data 
from both animal and human studies, which provide evidence suggestive of plausible pathways 
by which risk of respiratory or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality could be increased by 
ambient ozone. With respect to short-term exposure, the Ozone Criteria Document concluded, 
“This overall body of evidence is highly suggestive that ozone directly or indirectly contributes 
  
98 
 
 
to non-accidental and cardiopulmonary-related mortality, but additional research is needed to 
more fully establish underlying mechanisms by which such effects occur” (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
With respect to the time-series studies, the conclusion regarding the relationship between 
short-term ozone exposure and premature mortality is based, in part, upon recent city-specific 
time-series studies such as the Schwartz (2004) analysis in Houston and the Huang et al. (2004) 
analysis in Los Angeles.20 This conclusion is also based on recent meta-analyses by Bell et al. 
(2005), Ito et al. (2005), and Levy et al. (2005), and a new analysis of the National Morbidity, 
Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) data set by Bell et al. (2004), which specifically 
sought to disentangle the roles of ozone, PM, weather-related variables, and seasonality. The 
2006 Criteria Document states that “the results from these meta-analyses, as well as several 
single- and multiple-city studies, indicate that co-pollutants generally do not appear to 
substantially confound the association between ozone and mortality” (p. 7-103). However, 
CASAC raised questions about the implications of these time-series results in a policy context. 
Specifically, CASAC emphasized that “…while the time-series study design is a powerful tool to 
detect very small effects that could not be detected using other designs, it is also a blunt tool” 
(U.S. EPA-SAB, 2006). They point to findings (e.g., Stieb et al., 2002, 2003) that indicated 
associations between premature mortality and all of the criteria pollutants, indicating that 
“findings of time-series studies do not seem to allow us to confidently attribute observed effects 
to individual pollutants” (id.). They note that “not only is the interpretation of these associations 
complicated by the fact that the day-to-day variation in concentrations of these pollutants is, to a 
varying degree, determined by meteorology, the pollutants are often part of a large and highly 
correlated mix of pollutants, only a very few of which are measured” (id.). Even with these 
uncertainties, the CASAC Ozone Panel, in its review of EPA’s Staff Paper, found “…premature 
total non-accidental and cardiorespiratory mortality for inclusion in the quantitative risk 
assessment to be appropriate.” 
In 2006 the EPA requested an NAS study to answer four key questions regarding ozone 
mortality: (1) how did the epidemiological literature to that point improve our understanding of 
the size of the ozone mortality effect? (2) How best can EPA quantify the level of ozone 
mortality impacts from short-term exposure? (3) How might EPA estimate the change in life

expectancy? (4) What methods should EPA use to estimate the monetary value of changes in 
ozone-related mortality risk and life expectancy? 
In 2008 the NAS (NRC, 2008) issued a series of recommendations to the EPA regarding 
the quantification and valuation of ozone-related short-term mortality. Chief among these was 
that “…short-term exposure to ambient ozone is likely to contribute to premature deaths” and the 
committee recommended that “ozone-related mortality be included in future estimates of the 
health benefits of reducing ozone exposures…” The NAS also recommended that “…the greatest 
emphasis be placed on the multicity and NMMAPS studies without exclusion of the meta-
analyses” (NRC, 2008).   
Recent evidence also suggests a relationship between long-term exposure to ozone and 
premature respiratory mortality in the ACS cohort (Jerrett et al. 2009). Jerrett and colleagues find 
that long-term exposure to ozone is linked to respiratory premature mortality in a two-pollutant 
model that controls for PM2.5. This is the first long-term cohort study to have observed such a 
relationship.  In a December of 2009 consultation with the SAB-HES, the Agency proposed 
utilizing the Jerrett et al. (2009) analysis of the ACS cohort data. The panel is scheduled to issue 
an advisory in early 2010. 
In view of the findings of the Criteria document and the NAS panel, we include used 
estimates of short-term ozone mortality from the Bell et al. (2004) NMMAPS analysis, the 
Schwartz (2005) multi-city study, the Huang et al. (2005) multi-city study as well as effect 
estimates from the three meta-analyses (Bell et al. 2005, Levy et al. 2005 and Ito et al. 2005).  
5.4.2.3 Chronic Bronchitis 
CB is characterized by mucus in the lungs and a persistent wet cough for at least 3 
months a year for several years in a row.  CB affects an estimated 5 percent of the U.S. 
population (American Lung Association, 1999).  A limited number of studies have estimated the 
impact of air pollution on new incidences of CB.  Schwartz (1993) and Abbey et al. (1995) 
provide evidence that long-term PM exposure gives rise to the development of CB in the United 
States.  Because the Transport Rule is expected to reduce primarily PM2.5, this analysis uses only 
the Abbey et al. (1995) study, because it is the only study focusing on the relationship between 
PM2.5 and new incidences of CB.  
 
  
100 
 
 
5.4.2.4 Nonfatal Myocardial Infarctions (Heart Attacks) 
Nonfatal heart attacks have been linked with short-term exposures to PM2.5 in the United 
States (Peters et al., 2001) and other countries (Poloniecki et al., 1997).  We used a recent study 
by Peters et al. (2001) as the basis for the impact function estimating the relationship between 
PM2.5 and nonfatal heart attacks.  Peters et al. is the only available U.S. study to provide a 
specific estimate for heart attacks.  Other studies, such as Samet et al. (2000) and Moolgavkar 
(2000), show a consistent relationship between all cardiovascular hospital admissions, including 
those for nonfatal heart attacks, and PM.  Given the lasting impact of a heart attack on long-term 
health costs and earnings, we provide a separate estimate for nonfatal heart attacks.  The estimate 
used in the Transport Rule analysis is based on the single available U.S. effect estimate.  The 
finding of a specific impact on heart attacks is consistent with hospital admission and other 
studies showing relationships between fine particles and cardiovascular effects both within and 
outside the United States. Several epidemiologic studies (Liao et al., 1999; Gold et al., 2000; 
Magari et al., 2001) have shown that heart rate variability (an indicator of how much the heart is 
able to speed up or slow down in response to momentary stresses) is negatively related to PM 
levels.  Heart rate variability is a risk factor for heart attacks and other coronary heart diseases 
(Carthenon et al., 2002; Dekker et al., 2000; Liao et al., 1997; Tsuji et al., 1996).  As such, 
significant impacts of PM on heart rate variability are consistent with an increased risk of heart 
attacks. 
5.4.2.5 Hospital and Emergency Room Admissions 
Because of the availability of detailed hospital admission and discharge records, there is 
an extensive body of literature examining the relationship between hospital admissions and air 
pollution.  Because of this, many of the hospital admission endpoints use pooled impact 
functions based on the results of a number of studies.  In addition, some studies have examined 
the relationship between air pollution and emergency room visits.  Since most emergency room 
visits do not result in an admission to the hospital (the majority of people going to the emergency 
room are treated and return home), we treat hospital admissions and emergency room visits 
separately, taking account of the fraction of emergency room visits that are admitted to the 
hospital. 
The two main groups of hospital admissions estimated in this analysis are respiratory 
admissions and cardiovascular admissions.  There is not much evidence linking ozone or PM 
with other types of hospital admissions.  The only type of emergency room visits that have been 
consistently linked to ozone and PM in the United States are asthma-related visits.   
  
101 
 
 
To estimate avoided incidences of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with 
PM2.5, we used studies by Moolgavkar (2003) and Ito (2003).  Additional published studies show 
a statistically significant relationship between PM10 and cardiovascular hospital admissions.  
However, given that the control options we are analyzing are expected to reduce primarily PM2.5, 
we focus on the two studies that examine PM2.5.  Both of these studies provide an effect estimate 
for populations over 65, allowing us to pool the impact functions for this age group.  Only 
Moolgavkar (2000) provided a separate effect estimate for populations 20 to 64.21  Total 
cardiovascular hospital admissions are thus the sum of the pooled estimate for populations over 
65 and the single study estimate for populations 20 to 64.  Cardiovascular hospital admissions 
include admissions for myocardial infarctions.  To avoid double-counting benefits from 
reductions in myocardial infarctions when applying the impact function for cardiovascular 
hospital admissions, we first adjusted the baseline cardiovascular hospital admissions to remove 
admissions for myocardial infarctions.   
To estimate total avoided incidences of respiratory hospital admissions, we used impact 
functions for several respiratory causes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), pneumonia, and asthma.  As with cardiovascular admissions, additional published 
studies show a statistically significant relationship between PM10 and respiratory hospital 
admissions.  We used only those focusing on PM2.5.  Both Moolgavkar (2000) and Ito (2003) 
provide effect estimates for COPD in populations over 65, allowing us to pool the impact 
functions for this group.  Only Moolgavkar (2000) provides a separate effect estimate for 
populations 20 to 64.  Total COPD hospital admissions are thus the sum of the pooled estimate 
for populations over 65 and the single study estimate for populations 20 to 64.  Only Ito (2003) 
estimated pneumonia and only for the population 65 and older.  In addition, Sheppard (2003) 
provided an effect estimate for asthma hospital admissions for populations under age 65.  Total 
avoided incidences of PM-related respiratory-related hospital admissions are the sum of COPD, 
pneumonia, and asthma admissions. 
To estimate the effects of PM air pollution reductions on asthma-related ER visits, we 
use the effect estimate from a study of children 18 and under by Norris et al. (1999).  As noted 
earlier, there is another study by Schwartz examining a broader age group (less than 65), but the 
Schwartz study focused on PM10 rather than PM2.5.  We selected the Norris et al. (1999) effect 
                                                 
21Note that the Moolgavkar (2000) study has not been updated to reflect the more stringent GAM convergence 
criteria.  However, given that no other estimates are available for this age group, we chose to use the existing 
study.  Given the very small (<5 percent) difference in the effect estimates for people 65 and older with 
cardiovascular hospital admissions between the original and reanalyzed results, we do not expect this choice to 
introduce much bias.

estimate because it better matched the pollutant of interest.  Because children tend to have higher 
rates of hospitalization for asthma relative to adults under 65, we will likely capture the majority 
of the impact of PM2.5 on asthma emergency room visits in populations under 65, although there 
may still be significant impacts in the adult population under 65.   
To estimate avoided incidences of respiratory hospital admissions associated with ozone, 
we used a number of studies examining hospital admissions for a range of respiratory illnesses, 
including pneumonia and COPD.  Two age groups, adults over 65 and children under 2, were 
examined.  For adults over 65, Schwartz (1995) provides effect estimates for two different cities 
relating ozone and hospital admissions for all respiratory causes (defined as ICD codes 460–
519).  Impact functions based on these studies were pooled first before being pooled with other 
studies.  Two studies (Moolgavkar et al., 1997; Schwartz, 1994a) examine ozone and pneumonia 
hospital admissions in Minneapolis.  One additional study (Schwartz, 1994b) examines ozone 
and pneumonia hospital admissions in Detroit.  The impact functions for Minneapolis were 
pooled together first, and the resulting impact function was then pooled with the impact function 
for Detroit.  This avoids assigning too much weight to the information coming from one city.  
For COPD hospital admissions, two studies are available:  Moolgavkar et al. (1997), conducted 
in Minneapolis, and Schwartz (1994b), conducted in Detroit.  These two studies were pooled 
together.  To estimate total respiratory hospital admissions for adults over 65, COPD admissions 
were added to pneumonia admissions, and the result was pooled with the Schwartz (1995) 
estimate of total respiratory admissions.  Burnett et al. (2001) is the only study providing an 
effect estimate for respiratory hospital admissions in children under 2. 
We used two studies as the source of the concentration-response functions we used to 
estimate the effects of ozone exposure on asthma-related emergency room (ER) visits: Peel et al. 
(2005) and Wilson et al. (2005). We estimated the change in ER visits using the effect 
estimate(s) from each study and then pooled the results using the random effects pooling 
technique (see Abt, 2005). The Peel et al. study (2005) estimated asthma-related ER visits for all 
ages in Atlanta, using air quality data from 1993 to 2000. Using Poisson generalized estimating 
equations, the authors found a marginal association between the maximum daily 8-hour average 
ozone level and ER visits for asthma over a 3-day moving average (lags of 0, 1, and 2 days) in a 
single pollutant model. Wilson et al. (2005) examined the relationship between ER visits for 
respiratory illnesses and asthma and air pollution for all people residing in Portland, Maine from 
1998–2000 and Manchester, New Hampshire from 1996–2000. For all models used in the 
analysis, the authors restricted the ozone data incorporated into the model to the months ozone 
levels are usually measured, the spring-summer months (April through September). Using the 
  
103 
 
 
generalized additive model, Wilson et al. (2005) found a significant association between the 
maximum daily 8-hour average ozone level and ER visits for asthma in Portland, but found no 
significant association for Manchester. Similar to the approach used to generate effect estimates 
for hospital admissions, we used random effects pooling to combine the results across the 
individual study estimates for ER visits for asthma. The Peel et al. (2005) and Wilson et al. 
(2005) Manchester estimates were not significant at the 95 percent level, and thus, the 
confidence interval for the pooled incidence estimate based on these studies includes negative 
values. This is an artifact of the statistical power of the studies, and the negative values in the 
tails of the estimated effect distributions do not represent improvements in health as ozone 
concentrations are increased. Instead, these should be viewed as a measure of uncertainty due to 
limitations in the statistical power of the study. We included both hospital admissions and ER 
visits as separate endpoints associated with ozone exposure because our estimates of hospital 
admission costs do not include the costs of ER visits and most asthma ER visits do not result in a 
hospital admission. 
5.4.2.6 Acute Health Events and School/Work Loss Days 
In addition to mortality, chronic illness, and hospital admissions, a number of acute 
health effects not requiring hospitalization are associated with exposure to ambient levels of 
ozone and PM.  The sources for the effect estimates used to quantify these effects are described 
below.  
Around 4 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 5 and 17 experience episodes of 
acute bronchitis annually (American Lung Association, 2002c).  Acute bronchitis is 
characterized by coughing, chest discomfort, slight fever, and extreme tiredness, lasting for a 
number of days.  According to the MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia,22 with the exception of 
cough, most acute bronchitis symptoms abate within 7 to 10 days.  Incidence of episodes of 
acute bronchitis in children between the ages of 5 and 17 were estimated using an effect estimate 
developed from Dockery et al. (1996).   
Incidences of lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing, deep cough) in children aged 
7 to 14 were estimated using an effect estimate from Schwartz and Neas (2000).   
Because asthmatics have greater sensitivity to stimuli (including air pollution), children 
with asthma can be more susceptible to a variety of upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny or 
stuffy nose; wet cough; and burning, aching, or red eyes).  Research on the effects of air 
                                                 
22See http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000124.htm, accessed January 2002.

pollution on upper respiratory symptoms has thus focused on effects in asthmatics.  Incidences of 
upper respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children aged 9 to 11 are estimated using an effect 
estimate developed from Pope et al. (1991).  
Health effects from air pollution can also result in missed days of work (either from 
personal symptoms or from caring for a sick family member).  Days of work lost due to PM2.5 
were estimated using an effect estimate developed from Ostro (1987).  Children may also be 
absent from school because of respiratory or other diseases caused by exposure to air pollution.  
Most studies examining school absence rates have found little or no association with PM2.5, but 
several studies have found a significant association between ozone levels and school absence 
rates.  We used two recent studies, Gilliland et al. (2001) and Chen et al. (2000), to estimate 
changes in absences (school loss days) due to changes in ozone levels.  The Gilliland et al. study 
estimated the incidence of new periods of absence, while the Chen et al. study examined absence 
on a given day.  We converted the Gilliland estimate to days of absence by multiplying the 
absence periods by the average duration of an absence.  We estimated an average duration of 
school absence of 1.6 days by dividing the average daily school absence rate from Chen et al. 
(2000) and Ransom and Pope (1992) by the episodic absence rate from Gilliland et al. (2001).  
This provides estimates from Chen et al. (2000) and Gilliland et al. (2001), which can be pooled 
to provide an overall estimate. 
MRAD result when individuals reduce most usual daily activities and replace them with 
less strenuous activities or rest, yet not to the point of missing work or school.  For example, a 
mechanic who would usually be doing physical work most of the day will instead spend the day 
at a desk doing paper and phone work because of difficulty breathing or chest pain.  The effect of 
PM2.5 and ozone on MRAD was estimated using an effect estimate derived from Ostro and 
Rothschild (1989). 
  
105 
 
 
For the Transport Rule, we have followed the SAB-HES recommendations regarding 
asthma exacerbations in developing the primary estimate.  To prevent double-counting, we 
focused the estimation on asthma exacerbations occurring in children and excluded adults from 
the calculation.23  Asthma exacerbations occurring in adults are assumed to be captured in the 
general population endpoints such as work loss days and MRADs.  Consequently, if we had 
included an adult-specific asthma exacerbation estimate, we would likely double-count incidence 
for this endpoint.  However, because the general population endpoints do not cover children 
(with regard to asthmatic effects), an analysis focused specifically on asthma exacerbations for 
children (6 to 18 years of age) could be conducted without concern for double-counting.  
To characterize asthma exacerbations in children, we selected two studies (Ostro et al., 
2001; Vedal et al., 1998) that followed panels of asthmatic children.  Ostro et al. (2001) followed 
a group of 138 African-American children in Los Angeles for 13 weeks, recording daily 
occurrences of respiratory symptoms associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., shortness of 
breath, wheeze, and cough).  This study found a statistically significant association between 
PM2.5, measured as a 12-hour average, and the daily prevalence of shortness of breath and 
wheeze endpoints.  Although the association was not statistically significant for cough, the 
results were still positive and close to significance; consequently, we decided to include this 
endpoint, along with shortness of breath and wheeze, in generating incidence estimates (see 
below).  Vedal et al. (1998) followed a group of elementary school children, including 74 
asthmatics, located on the west coast of Vancouver Island for 18 months including 
measurements of daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the tracking of respiratory symptoms 
(e.g., cough, phlegm, wheeze, chest tightness) through the use of daily diaries.  Association 
between PM10 and respiratory symptoms for the asthmatic population was only reported for two 
                                                 
23Estimating asthma exacerbations associated with air pollution exposures is difficult, due to concerns about double 
counting of benefits.  Concerns over double counting stem from the fact that studies of the general population also 
include asthmatics, so estimates based solely on the asthmatic population cannot be directly added to the general 
population numbers without double counting.  In one specific case (upper respiratory symptoms in children), the 
only study available is limited to asthmatic children, so this endpoint can be readily included in the calculation of 
total benefits.  However, other endpoints, such as lower respiratory symptoms and MRADs, are estimated for the 
total population that includes asthmatics.  Therefore, to simply add predictions of asthma-related symptoms 
generated for the population of asthmatics to these total population-based estimates could result in double 
counting, especially if they evaluate similar endpoints.  The SAB-HES, in commenting on the analytical blueprint 
for 812, acknowledged these challenges in evaluating asthmatic symptoms and appropriately adding them into the 
primary analysis (SAB-HES, 2004).  However, despite these challenges, the SAB-HES recommends the addition 
of asthma-related symptoms (i.e., asthma exacerbations) to the primary analysis, provided that the studies use the 
panel study approach and that they have comparable design and baseline frequencies in both asthma prevalence 
and exacerbation rates.  Note also, that the SAB-HES, while supporting the incorporation of asthma exacerbation 
estimates, does not believe that the association between ambient air pollution, including ozone and PM, and the 
new onset of asthma is sufficiently strong to support inclusion of this asthma-related endpoint in the primary 
estimate.   
  
106 
 
 
endpoints:  cough and PEF.  Because it is difficult to translate PEF measures into clearly defined 
health endpoints that can be monetized, we only included the cough-related effect estimate from 
this study in quantifying asthma exacerbations.  We employed the following pooling approach in 
combining estimates generated using effect estimates from the two studies to produce a single 
asthma exacerbation incidence estimate.  First, we pooled the separate incidence estimates for 
shortness of breath, wheeze, and cough generated using effect estimates from the Ostro et al. 
study, because each of these endpoints is aimed at capturing the same overall endpoint (asthma 
exacerbations) and there could be overlap in their predictions.  The pooled estimate from the 
Ostro et al. study is then pooled with the cough-related estimate generated using the Vedal study. 
 The rationale for this second pooling step is similar to the first; both studies are attempting to 
quantify the same overall endpoint (asthma exacerbations).   
5.4.2.7 School Absences 
Children may be absent from school due to respiratory or other acute diseases caused, or 
aggravated by, exposure to air pollution. Several studies have found a significant association 
between ozone levels and school absence rates. We use two studies (Gilliland et al., 2001; Chen 
et al., 2000) to estimate changes in school absences resulting from changes in ozone levels. The 
Gilliland et al. study estimated the incidence of new periods of absence, while the Chen et al. 
study examined daily absence rates. We converted the Gilliland et al. estimate to days of absence 
by multiplying the absence periods by the average duration of an absence. We estimated 1.6 days 
as the average duration of a school absence, the result of dividing the average daily school 
absence rate from Chen et al. (2000) and Ransom and Pope (1992) by the episodic absence 
duration from Gilliland et al. (2001). Thus, each Gilliland et al. period of absence is converted 
into 1.6 absence days. 
Following advice from the National Research Council (2002), we calculated reductions 
in school absences for the full population of school age children, ages five to 17. This is 
consistent with recent peer-reviewed literature on estimating the impact of ozone exposure on 
school absences (Hall et al. 2003). We estimated the change in school absences using both Chen 
et al. (2000) and Gilliland et al. (2001) and then, similar to hospital admissions and ER visits, 
pooled the results using the random effects pooling procedure. 
5.4.2.8 Outdoor Worker Productivity 
To monetize benefits associated with increased worker productivity resulting from 
improved ozone air quality, we used information reported in Crocker and Horst (1981). Crocker 
  
107 
 
 
and Horst examined the impacts of ozone exposure on the productivity of outdoor citrus workers. 
The study measured productivity impacts. Worker productivity is measuring the value of the loss 
in productivity for a worker who is at work on a particular day, but due to ozone, cannot work as 
hard. It only applies to outdoor workers, like fruit and vegetable pickers, or construction 
workers. Here, productivity impacts are measured as the change in income associated with a 
change in ozone exposure, given as the elasticity of income with respect to ozone concentration. 
The reported elasticity translates a ten percent reduction in ozone to a 1.4 percent increase in 
income. Given the national median daily income for outdoor workers engaged in strenuous 
activity reported by the U.S. Census Bureau (2002), $81 per day (2006$), a ten percent reduction 
in ozone yields about $0.97 in increased daily wages. We adjust the national median daily 
income estimate to reflect regional variations in income using a factor based on the ratio of 
county median household income to national median household income. No information was 
available for quantifying the uncertainty associated with the central valuation estimate. 
Therefore, no uncertainty analysis was conducted for this endpoint. 
5.4.3 Baseline Incidence Estimates 
Epidemiological studies of the association between pollution levels and adverse health 
effects generally provide a direct estimate of the relationship of air quality changes to the 
relative risk of a health effect, rather than estimating the absolute number of avoided cases. For 
example, a typical result might be that a 10 ppb decrease in daily ozone levels might, in turn, 
decrease hospital admissions by 3 percent. The baseline incidence of the health effect is 
necessary to convert this relative change into a number of cases. A baseline incidence rate is the 
estimate of the number of cases of the health effect per year in the assessment location, as it 
corresponds to baseline pollutant levels in that location. To derive the total baseline incidence 
per year, this rate must be multiplied by the corresponding population number. For example, if 
the baseline incidence rate is the number of cases per year per million people, that number must 
be multiplied by the millions of people in the total population. 
Table 5-6 summarizes the sources of baseline incidence rates and provides average 
incidence rates for the endpoints included in the analysis. For both baseline incidence and 
prevalence data, we used age-specific rates where available. We applied concentration-response 
functions to individual age groups and then summed over the relevant age range to provide an 
estimate of total population benefits. In most cases, we used a single national incidence rate, due 
to a lack of more spatially disaggregated data. Whenever possible, the national rates used are 
national averages, because these data are most applicable to a national assessment of benefits. 
For some studies, however, the only available incidence information comes from the studies 
  
108 
 
 
themselves; in these cases, incidence in the study population is assumed to represent typical 
incidence at the national level. Regional incidence rates are available for hospital admissions, 
and county-level data are available for premature mortality. We have projected mortality rates 
such that future mortality rates are consistent with our projections of population growth (Abt 
Associates, 2008); this represents a change from the 2005 CAIR analysis, which used static 
rates. 
For the set of endpoints affecting the asthmatic population, in addition to baseline 
incidence rates, prevalence rates of asthma in the population are needed to define the applicable 
population.  Table 5-7 lists the prevalence rates used to determine the applicable population for 
asthma symptom endpoints.  Note that these reflect current asthma prevalence and assume no 
change in prevalence rates in future years. We again highlight in blue those rates that have been 
updated since the publication of the 2005 CAIR RIA.

5.4.4 Economic Valuation Estimates 
Reductions in ambient concentrations of air pollution generally lower the risk of future 
adverse health effects for a large population. Therefore, the appropriate economic measure is 
WTP for changes in risk of a health effect rather than WTP for a health effect that would occur 
with certainty (Freeman, 1993). Epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the 
relative risks of a particular health effect that is avoided because of a reduction in air pollution. 
We converted those to units of avoided statistical incidence for ease of presentation. We 
  
111 
 
 
calculated the value of avoided statistical incidences by dividing individual WTP for a risk 
reduction by the related observed change in risk.  
WTP estimates generally are not available for some health effects, such as hospital 
admissions. In these cases, we used the cost of treating or mitigating the effect as a primary 
estimate. These cost-of-illness (COI) estimates generally understate the true value of reducing 
the risk of a health effect, because they reflect the direct expenditures related to treatment, but 
not the value of avoided pain and suffering (Harrington and Portney, 1987; Berger, 1987). We 
provide unit values for health endpoints (along with information on the distribution of the unit 
value) in Table 5-8. All values are in constant year 2006 dollars, adjusted for growth in real 
income out to 2014 using projections provided by Standard and Poor’s. Economic theory argues 
that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) will increase if real income 
increases. Many of the valuation studies used in this analysis were conducted in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s. Because real income has grown since the studies were conducted, people’s 
willingness to pay for reductions in the risk of premature death and disease likely has grown as 
well. We did not adjust cost of illness-based values because they are based on current costs. 
Similarly, we did not adjust the value of school absences, because that value is based on current 
wage rates. For these two reasons, these cost of illness estimates may underestimate the 
economic value of avoided health impacts in 2014. The discussion below provides additional 
details on ozone and PM2.5-related related endpoints. 
5.4.4.1 Mortality Valuation 
Following the advice of the EEAC of the SAB, EPA currently uses the VSL approach in 
calculating the primary estimate of mortality benefits, because we believe this calculation 
provides the most reasonable single estimate of an individual’s willingness to trade off money 
for reductions in mortality risk (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000).  The VSL approach is a summary 
measure for the value of small changes in mortality risk experienced by a large number of 
people.  For a period of time (2004-2008), the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued 
mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited 
analysis of some of the available studies.  OAR arrived at a VSL using a range of $1 million to 
$10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of the wage-risk literature.  The $1 
million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range from the Mrozek and Taylor 
(2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies.  The $10 million value represented the upper end of the 
interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-analysis of 43 studies.  The mean 
estimate of $5.5 million (2000$) was also consistent with the mean VSL of $5.4 million 
  
112 
 
 
estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis.  However, the Agency neither changed its 
official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected the interim estimate to a 
scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board (SAB) or other peer-review 
group.   
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources.  In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue.  With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007).   
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received.  Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the 
Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)24 while the Agency continues its 
efforts to update its guidance on this issue.  This approach calculates a mean value across VSL 
estimates derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 
and 1991.  The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).25  The Agency is 
committed to using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality 
risk reductions and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s specific 
recommendations.  The Agency anticipates presenting results from this effort to the SAB-EEAC 
in Spring 2010 and that draft guidance will be available shortly thereafter. 
As indicated in the previous section on quantification of premature mortality benefits, we 
assumed for this analysis that some of the incidences of premature mortality related to PM 
exposures occur in a distributed fashion over the 20 years following exposure.  To take this into 
                                                 
24 In the (draft) update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2008d), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB 
with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the 
near future.  Therefore, this report does not represent final agency policy.   
25  In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2006$) and to account for income 
growth to 2014.  After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $7.8M.   
  
113 
 
 
account in the valuation of reductions in premature mortality, we applied an annual 3% discount 
rate to the value of premature mortality occurring in future years.26 
The economics literature concerning the appropriate method for valuing reductions in 
premature mortality risk is still developing.  The adoption of a value for the projected reduction 
in the risk of premature mortality is the subject of continuing discussion within the economics 
and public policy analysis community.  EPA strives to use the best economic science in its 
analyses.  Given the mixed theoretical finding and empirical evidence regarding adjustments to 
VSL for risk and population characteristics, we use a single VSL for all reductions in mortality 
risk. 
Although there are several differences between the labor market studies EPA uses to 
derive a VSL estimate and the PM air pollution context addressed here, those differences in the 
affected populations and the nature of the risks imply both upward and downward adjustments.  
Table 5-11 lists some of these differences and the expected effect on the VSL estimate for air 
pollution-related mortality. In the absence of a comprehensive and balanced set of adjustment 
factors, EPA believes it is reasonable to continue to use the $6.3 million value while 
acknowledging the significant limitations and uncertainties in the available literature. 
                                                 
26 The choice of a discount rate, and its associated conceptual basis, is a topic of ongoing discussion within the 
federal government.  EPA adopted a 3% discount rate for its base estimate in this case to reflect reliance on a 
“social rate of time preference” discounting concept.  We have also calculated benefits and costs using a 7% rate 
consistent with an “opportunity cost of capital” concept to reflect the time value of resources directed to meet 
regulatory requirements.  In this case, the benefit and cost estimates were not significantly affected by the choice 
of discount rate.  Further discussion of this topic appears in EPA’s Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses 
(EPA, 2000b).

The SAB-EEAC has reviewed many potential VSL adjustments and the state of the 
economics literature.  The SAB-EEAC advised EPA to “continue to use a wage-risk-based VSL 
as its primary estimate, including appropriate sensitivity analyses to reflect the uncertainty of 
these estimates,” and that “the only risk characteristic for which adjustments to the VSL can be 
made is the timing of the risk” (U.S. EPA, 2000a).  In developing our primary estimate of the 
benefits of premature mortality reductions, we have followed this advice and discounted over the 
lag period between exposure and premature mortality. 
Uncertainties Specific to Premature Mortality Valuation.  The economic benefits 
associated with reductions in the risk of premature mortality are the largest category of 
monetized benefits of the Transport Rule.  In addition, in prior analyses, EPA has identified 
valuation of mortality-related benefits as the largest contributor to the range of uncertainty in 
monetized benefits (U.S. EPA, 1999b).27  Because of the uncertainty in estimates of the value of 
reducing premature mortality risk, it is important to adequately characterize and understand the 
various types of economic approaches available for valuing reductions in mortality risk.  Such an 
assessment also requires an understanding of how alternative valuation approaches reflect that 
some individuals may be more susceptible to air pollution-induced mortality or reflect 
differences in the nature of the risk presented by air pollution relative to the risks studied in the 
relevant economics literature. 
                                                 
27 This conclusion was based on an assessment of uncertainty based on statistical error in epidemiological effect 
estimates and economic valuation estimates.  Additional sources of model error such as those examined in the PM 
mortality expert elicitation may result in different conclusions about the relative contribution of sources of 
uncertainty.

The health science literature on air pollution indicates that several human characteristics 
affect the degree to which mortality risk affects an individual.  For example, some age groups 
appear to be more susceptible to air pollution than others (e.g., the elderly and children).  Health 
status prior to exposure also affects susceptibility.  An ideal benefits estimate of mortality risk 
reduction would reflect these human characteristics, in addition to an individual’s WTP to 
improve one’s own chances of survival plus WTP to improve other individuals’ survival rates.  
The ideal measure would also take into account the specific nature of the risk reduction 
commodity that is provided to individuals, as well as the context in which risk is reduced.  To 
measure this value, it is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of 
dying from the time that reductions take effect onward and how individuals value these changes. 
 Each individual’s survival curve, or the probability of surviving beyond a given age, should 
shift as a result of an environmental quality improvement.  For example, changing the current 
probability of survival for an individual also shifts future probabilities of that individual’s 
survival.  This probability shift will differ across individuals because survival curves depend on 
such characteristics as age, health state, and the current age to which the individual is likely to 
survive. 
Although a survival curve approach provides a theoretically preferred method for valuing 
the benefits of reduced risk of premature mortality associated with reducing air pollution, the 
approach requires a great deal of data to implement.  The economic valuation literature does not 
yet include good estimates of the value of this risk reduction commodity.  As a result, in this 
study we value reductions in premature mortality risk using the VSL approach. 
Other uncertainties specific to premature mortality valuation include the following: 
 Across-study variation:  There is considerable uncertainty as to whether the available 
literature on VSL provides adequate estimates of the VSL for risk reductions from air 
pollution reduction.  Although there is considerable variation in the analytical designs 
and data used in the existing literature, the majority of the studies involve the value of 
risks to a middle-aged working population.  Most of the studies examine differences in 
wages of risky occupations, using a hedonic wage approach.  Certain characteristics of 
both the population affected and the mortality risk facing that population are believed to 
affect the average WTP to reduce the risk.  The appropriateness of a distribution of WTP 
based on the current VSL literature for valuing the mortality-related benefits of 
reductions in air pollution concentrations therefore depends not only on the quality of the 
studies (i.e., how well they measure what they are trying to measure), but also on the 
extent to which the risks being valued are similar and the extent to which the subjects in 
the studies are similar to the population affected by changes in pollution concentrations. 
  
116 
 
 
 Level of risk reduction:  The transferability of estimates of the VSL from the wage-risk 
studies to the context of the PM NAAQS analysis rests on the assumption that, within a 
reasonable range, WTP for reductions in mortality risk is linear in risk reduction.  For 
example, suppose a study provides a result that the average WTP for a reduction in 
mortality risk of 1/100,000 is $50, but that the actual mortality risk reduction resulting 
from a given pollutant reduction is 1/10,000.  If WTP for reductions in mortality risk is 
linear in risk reduction, then a WTP of $50 for a reduction of 1/100,000 implies a WTP 
of $500 for a risk reduction of 1/10,000 (which is 10 times the risk reduction valued in 
the study).  Under the assumption of linearity, the estimate of the VSL does not depend 
on the particular amount of risk reduction being valued.  This assumption has been shown 
to be reasonable provided the change in the risk being valued is within the range of risks 
evaluated in the underlying studies (Rowlatt et al., 1998). 
 Voluntariness of risks evaluated:  Although job-related mortality risks may differ in 
several ways from air pollution-related mortality risks, the most important difference may 
be that job-related risks are incurred voluntarily, or generally assumed to be, whereas air 
pollution-related risks are incurred involuntarily.  Some evidence suggests that people 
will pay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks than risks incurred voluntarily.  If 
this is the case, WTP estimates based on wage-risk studies may understate WTP to 
reduce involuntarily incurred air pollution-related mortality risks. 
 Sudden versus protracted death:  A final important difference related to the nature of the 
risk may be that some workplace mortality risks tend to involve sudden, catastrophic 
events, whereas air pollution-related risks tend to involve longer periods of disease and 
suffering prior to death.  Some evidence suggests that WTP to avoid a risk of a protracted 
death involving prolonged suffering and loss of dignity and personal control is greater 
than the WTP to avoid a risk (of identical magnitude) of sudden death.  To the extent that 
the mortality risks addressed in this assessment are associated with longer periods of 
illness or greater pain and suffering than are the risks addressed in the valuation 
literature, the WTP measurements employed in the present analysis would reflect a 
downward bias. 
 Self-selection and skill in avoiding risk:  Recent research (Shogren and Stamland, 2002) 
suggests that VSL estimates based on hedonic wage studies may overstate the average 
value of a risk reduction.  This is based on the fact that the risk-wage trade-off revealed 
in hedonic studies reflects the preferences of the marginal worker (i.e., that worker who 
demands the highest compensation for his risk reduction).  This worker must have either 
a higher workplace risk than the average worker, a lower risk tolerance than the average 
worker, or both.  However, the risk estimate used in hedonic studies is generally based on 
  
117 
 
 
average risk, so the VSL may be upwardly biased because the wage differential and risk 
measures do not match. 
 Baseline risk and age:  Recent research (Smith, Pattanayak, and Van Houtven, 2006) 
finds that because individuals reevaluate their baseline risk of death as they age, the 
marginal value of risk reductions does not decline with age as predicted by some lifetime 
consumption models.  This research supports findings in recent stated preference studies 
that suggest only small reductions in the value of mortality risk reductions with 
increasing age. 
5.4.4.2 Chronic Bronchitis Valuation 
The best available estimate of WTP to avoid a case of CB comes from Viscusi, Magat, 
and Huber (1991).  The Viscusi, Magat, and Huber study, however, describes a severe case of 
CB to the survey respondents.  We therefore employ an estimate of WTP to avoid a pollution-
related case of CB, based on adjusting the Viscusi, Magat, and Huber (1991) estimate of the 
WTP to avoid a severe case.  This is done to account for the likelihood that an average case of 
pollution-related CB is not as severe.  The adjustment is made by applying the elasticity of WTP 
with respect to severity reported in the Krupnick and Cropper (1992) study.  Details of this 
adjustment procedure are provided in the Benefits Technical Support Document (TSD) for the 
Nonroad Diesel rulemaking (Abt Associates, 2003). 
We use the mean of a distribution of WTP estimates as the central tendency estimate of 
WTP to avoid a pollution-related case of CB in this analysis.  The distribution incorporates 
uncertainty from three sources:  the WTP to avoid a case of severe CB, as described by Viscusi, 
Magat, and Huber; the severity level of an average pollution-related case of CB (relative to that 
of the case described by Viscusi, Magat, and Huber); and the elasticity of WTP with respect to 
severity of the illness.  Based on assumptions about the distributions of each of these three 
uncertain components, we derive a distribution of WTP to avoid a pollution-related case of CB 
by statistical uncertainty analysis techniques.  The expected value (i.e., mean) of this 
distribution, which is about $340,000 (2006$), is taken as the central tendency estimate of WTP 
to avoid a PM-related case of CB. 
5.4.4.3 Nonfatal Myocardial Infarctions Valuation 
The Agency has recently incorporated into its analyses the impact of air pollution on the 
expected number of nonfatal heart attacks, although it has examined the impact of reductions in 
other related cardiovascular endpoints.  We were not able to identify a suitable WTP value for 
  
118 
 
 
reductions in the risk of nonfatal heart attacks.  Instead, we use a COI unit value with two 
components:  the direct medical costs and the opportunity cost (lost earnings) associated with the 
illness event.  Because the costs associated with a myocardial infarction extend beyond the initial 
event itself, we consider costs incurred over several years.  Using age-specific annual lost 
earnings estimated by Cropper and Krupnick (1990) and a 3% discount rate, we estimated a 
present discounted value in lost earnings (in 2006$) over 5 years due to a myocardial infarction 
of $8,774 for someone between the ages of 25 and 44, $12,932 for someone between the ages of 
45 and 54, and $74,746 for someone between the ages of 55 and 65.  The corresponding age-
specific estimates of lost earnings (in 2006$) using a 7% discount rate are $7,855, $11,578, and 
$66,920, respectively.  Cropper and Krupnick (1990) do not provide lost earnings estimates for 
populations under 25 or over 65.  As such, we do not include lost earnings in the cost estimates 
for these age groups. 
We found three possible sources in the literature of estimates of the direct medical costs 
of myocardial infarction: 
 Wittels et al. (1990) estimated expected total medical costs of myocardial infarction over 
5 years to be $51,211 (in 1986$) for people who were admitted to the hospital and 
survived hospitalization.  (There does not appear to be any discounting used.)  Wittels et 
al. was used to value coronary heart disease in the 812 Retrospective Analysis of the 
Clean Air Act.  Using the CPI-U for medical care, the Wittels estimate is $144,111 in 
year 2006$.  This estimated cost is based on a medical cost model, which incorporated 
therapeutic options, projected outcomes, and prices (using “knowledgeable cardiologists” 
as consultants).  The model used medical data and medical decision algorithms to 
estimate the probabilities of certain events and/or medical procedures being used.  The 
authors note that the average length of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction has 
decreased over time (from an average of 12.9 days in 1980 to an average of 11 days in 
1983).  Wittels et al. used 10 days as the average in their study.  It is unclear how much 
further the length of stay for myocardial infarction may have decreased from 1983 to the 
present.  The average length of stay for ICD code 410 (myocardial infarction) in the year-
2000 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) HCUP database is 5.5 days.  
However, this may include patients who died in the hospital (not included among our 
nonfatal myocardial infarction cases), whose length of stay was therefore substantially 
shorter than it would be if they had not died. 
 Eisenstein et al. (2001) estimated 10-year costs of $44,663 in 1997$, or $64,003 in 2006$ 
for myocardial infarction patients, using statistical prediction (regression) models to 
estimate inpatient costs.  Only inpatient costs (physician fees and hospital costs) were 
included. 
  
119 
 
 
 Russell et al. (1998) estimated first-year direct medical costs of treating nonfatal 
myocardial infarction of $15,540 (in 1995$) and $1,051 annually thereafter.  Converting 
to year 2006$, that would be $30,102 for a 5-year period (without discounting) or 
$38,113 for a 10-year period. 
In summary, the three different studies provided significantly different values (see Table 
5-9).

As noted above, the estimates from these three studies are substantially different, and we 
have not adequately resolved the sources of differences in the estimates.  Because the wage-
related opportunity cost estimates from Cropper and Krupnick (1990) cover a 5-year period, we 
used estimates for medical costs that similarly cover a 5-year period (i.e., estimates from Wittels 
et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1998).  We used a simple average of the two 5-year estimates, or 
$65,902, and added it to the 5-year opportunity cost estimate.  The resulting estimates are given 
in Table 5-10.

5.4.4.4 Hospital Admissions Valuation 
In the absence of estimates of societal WTP to avoid hospital visits/admissions for 
specific illnesses, estimates of total cost of illness (total medical costs plus the value of lost 
productivity) typically are used as conservative, or lower bound, estimates. These estimates are 
biased downward, because they do not include the willingness-to-pay value of avoiding pain and 
suffering.  
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9, 1979) code-specific COI estimates 
used in this analysis consist of estimated hospital charges and the estimated opportunity cost of 
time spent in the hospital (based on the average length of a hospital stay for the illness). We 
based all estimates of hospital charges and length of stays on statistics provided by the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ 2000). We estimated the opportunity cost of a day 
spent in the hospital as the value of the lost daily wage, regardless of whether the hospitalized 
individual is in the workforce. To estimate the lost daily wage, we divided the 1990 median 
weekly wage by five and inflated the result to year 2006$ using the CPI-U “all items.” The 
resulting estimate is $127.93. The total cost-of-illness estimate for an ICD code-specific hospital 
stay lasting n days, then, was the mean hospital charge plus $127.93 multiplied by n.

Chronic Bronchitis (CB) $340,000 $460,000 The WTP to avoid a 
case of pollution-
related CB is 
calculated as where x 
is the severity of an 
average CB case, 
WTP13 is the WTP for 
a severe case of CB, 
and $ is the parameter 
relating WTP to 
severity, based on the 
regression results 
reported in Krupnick 
and Cropper (1992). 
The distribution of 
WTP for an average 
severity-level case of 
CB was generated by 
Monte Carlo methods, 
drawing from each of 
three distributions: (1) 
WTP to avoid a severe 
case of CB is assigned 
a 1/9 probability of 
being each of the first 
nine deciles of the 
distribution of WTP 
responses in Viscusi et 
al. (1991); (2) the 
severity of a pollution-
related case of CB 
(relative to the case 
described in the 
Viscusi study) is 
assumed to have a 
triangular distribution, 
with the most likely 
value at severity level 
6.5 and endpoints at 
1.0 and 12.0; and (3) 
the constant in the 
elasticity of WTP with 
respect to severity is 
normally distributed

from the health economics literature. The first estimate comes from Smith et al. (1997), who 
reported approximately 1.2 million asthma-related emergency room visits in 1987, at a total 
cost of $186.5 million (1987$). The average cost per visit that year was $155; in 2006$, that 
cost was $400.88 (using the CPI-U for medical care to adjust to 2006$). The second estimate 
comes from Stanford et al. (1999), who reported the cost of an average asthma-related 
emergency room visit at $335.14, based on 1996–1997 data. A simple average of the two 
estimates yields a (rounded) unit value of $368. 
5.4.4.6 Minor Restricted Activity Days Valuation  
No studies are reported to have estimated WTP to avoid a minor restricted activity 
day. However, one of EPA’s contractors, IEc (1994) has derived an estimate of willingness 
to pay to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day, using estimates from Tolley et al. 
(1986) of WTP for avoiding a combination of coughing, throat congestion and sinusitis. The 
IEc estimate of WTP to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day is $38.37 (1990$), or 
about $62.04 (2006$). 
Although Ostro and Rothschild (1989) statistically linked ozone and minor restricted 
activity days, it is likely that most MRADs associated with ozone exposure are, in fact, minor 
respiratory restricted activity days. For the purpose of valuing this health endpoint, we used 
the estimate of mean WTP to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day. 
5.4.4.7 School Absences Valuation 
To value a school absence, we: (1) estimated the probability that if a school child 
stays home from school, a parent will have to stay home from work to care for the child; and 
(2) valued the lost productivity at the parent’s wage. To do this, we estimated the number of 
families with school-age children in which both parents work, and we valued a school-loss 
  
 
 
129
day as the probability that such a day also would result in a work-loss day. We calculated this 
value by multiplying the proportion of households with school-age children by a measure of 
lost wages. 
We used this method in the absence of a preferable WTP method. However, this 
approach suffers from several uncertainties. First, it omits willingness to pay to avoid the 
symptoms/illness that resulted in the school absence; second, it effectively gives zero value 
to school absences that do not result in work-loss days; and third, it uses conservative 
assumptions about the wages of the parent staying home with the child. Finally, this method 
assumes that parents are unable to work from home. If this is not a valid assumption, then 
there would be no lost wages.  
For this valuation approach, we assumed that in a household with two working 
parents, the female parent will stay home with a sick child. From the Statistical Abstract of 
the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001), we obtained: (1) the numbers of single, 
married and “other” (widowed, divorced or separated) working women with children; and (2) 
the rates of participation in the workforce of single, married and “other” women with 
children. From these two sets of statistics, we calculated a weighted average participation 
rate of 72.85 percent. 
Our estimate of daily lost wage (wages lost if a mother must stay at home with a sick 
child) is based on the year 2006 median weekly wage among women ages 25 and older (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2001). This median weekly wage is $655. Dividing by five gives an 
estimated median daily wage of $131. To estimate the expected lost wages on a day when a 
mother has to stay home with a school-age child, we first estimated the probability that the 
mother is in the workforce then multiplied that estimate by the daily wage she would lose by 
missing a workday: 72.85 percent times $131, for a total loss of $95.43. This valuation 
approach is similar to that used by Hall et al. (2003). 
5.4.4.8  Visibility Valuation 
Reductions in NO2 and SO2 emissions along with the secondary formation of PM2.5 
would improve the level of visibility throughout the United States because these suspended 
particles and gases degrade visibility by scattering and absorbing light (U.S. EPA, 2009d). 
  
 
 
130
Visibility has direct significance to people’s enjoyment of daily activities and their overall 
sense of wellbeing (U.S. EPA, 2009d).  Individuals value visibility both in the places they 
live and work, in the places they travel to for recreational purposes, and at sites of unique 
public value, such as the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.  This section discusses the 
measurement of the economic benefits of improved visibility. 
Visual air quality (VAQ) is commonly measured as either light extinction, which is 
defined as the loss of light per unit of distance in terms of inverse megameters (Mm-1) or the 
deciview (dv) metric (Pitchford and Malm, 1993), which is a logarithmic function of 
extinction.  Extinction and deciviews are physical measures of the amount of visibility 
impairment (e.g., the amount of “haze”), with both extinction and deciview increasing as the 
amount of haze increases.  Pitchford and Malm characterize a change of one deciview as “a 
small but perceptible scenic change under many circumstances.” Light extinction is the 
optical characteristic of the atmosphere that occurs when light is either scattered or absorbed, 
which converts the light to heat.  Particulate matter and gases can both scatter and absorb 
light.  Fine particles with significant light-extinction efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, 
organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996).  The extent to which any amount of 
light extinction affects a person’s ability to view a scene depends on both scene and light 
characteristics.  For example, the appearance of a nearby object (i.e. a building) is generally 
less sensitive to a change in light extinction than the appearance of a similar object at a 
greater distance.  See Figure 5-3 for an illustration of the important factors affecting 
visibility.

In conjunction with the U.S. National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, other 
Federal land managers, and State organizations in the U.S., the U.S. EPA has supported 
visibility monitoring in national parks and wilderness areas since 1988.  The monitoring 
network known as IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) 
now includes 150 sites that represent almost all of the Class I areas across the country (see 
Figure 5-4) (U.S. EPA, 2009d).   
 
  
 
 
132

Annual average visibility conditions (reflecting light extinction due to both 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources) vary regionally across the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 
2009d).  The rural East generally has higher levels of impairment than remote sites in the 
West, with the exception of urban-influenced sites such as San Gorgonio Wilderness (CA) 
and Point Reyes National Seashore (CA), which have annual average levels comparable to 
certain sites in the Northeast (U.S. EPA, 2004).  Higher visibility impairment levels in the 
East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine particles, particularly sulfates, and 
higher average relative humidity levels.  While visibility trends have improved in most Class 
I areas, the recent data show that these areas continue to suffer from visibility impairment.  In 
eastern parks, average visual range has decreased from 90 miles to 15-25 miles, and in the 
West, visual range has decreased from 140 miles to 35-90 miles (U.S. EPA, 2004; U.S. EPA, 
1999b).   
  
 
 
133
   EPA distinguishes benefits from two categories of visibility changes:  residential 
visibility and recreational visibility.  In both cases economic benefits are believed to consist 
of use values and nonuse values.  Use values include the aesthetic benefits of better visibility, 
improved road and air safety, and enhanced recreation in activities like hunting and 
birdwatching.  Nonuse values are based on people’s beliefs that the environment ought to 
exist free of human-induced haze.  Nonuse values may be more important for recreational 
areas, particularly national parks and monuments. 
Residential visibility benefits are those that occur from visibility changes in urban, 
suburban, and rural areas.  In previous assessments, EPA used a study on residential 
visibility valuation conducted in 1990 (McClelland et al., 1993).  Subsequently, EPA 
designated the McClelland et al. study as significantly less reliable for regulatory benefit-cost 
analysis consistent with SAB advice (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999).  Although a wide range of 
published, peer-review literature supports a non-zero value for residential visibility 
(Brookshire et al., 1982; Rae, 1983; Tolley et al., 1986; Chestnut and Rowe, 1990c; 
McClleand et al., 1993; Loehman et al., 1994), the residential visibility benefits have not 
been calculated in this analysis. 
For recreational visibility, only one existing study provides defensible monetary 
estimates of the value of visibility changes in a 1988 survey on recreational visibility value 
(Chestnut and Rowe, 1990a; 1990b).  Although there are a number of other studies in the 
literature, they were conducted in the early 1980s and did not use methods that are 
considered defensible by current standards.  The Chestnut and Rowe study uses the CV 
method.  There has been a great deal of controversy and significant development of both 
theoretical and empirical knowledge about how to conduct CV surveys in the past decade.  In 
EPA’s judgment, the Chestnut and Rowe study contains many of the elements of a valid CV 
study and is sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for monetary estimates of the benefits 
of visibility changes in recreational areas.28  This study serves as an essential input to our 
                                                 
28 An SAB advisory letter indicates that “many members of the Council believe that the Chestnut and Rowe 
study is the best available” (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-002, 1999, p. 13).  However, the committee did 
not formally approve use of these estimates because of concerns about the peer-reviewed status of the study.  
EPA believes the study has received adequate review and has been cited in numerous peer-reviewed 
publications (Chestnut and Dennis, 1997). 
  
 
 
134
estimates of the benefits of recreational visibility improvements in the primary benefits 
estimates.   
For the purposes of this analysis, recreational visibility improvements are defined as 
those that occur specifically in federal Class I areas.29  A key distinction between 
recreational and residential benefits is that only those people living in residential areas are 
assumed to receive benefits from residential visibility, while all households in the United 
States are assumed to derive some benefit from improvements in Class I areas.  Values are 
assumed to be higher if the Class I area is located close to their home.30 The Chestnut and 
Rowe study measured the demand for visibility in Class I areas managed by the National 
Park Service (NPS) in three broad regions of the country:  California, the Southwest, and the 
Southeast.  Respondents in five states were asked about their WTP to protect national parks 
or NPS-managed wilderness areas within a particular region.  The survey used photographs 
reflecting different visibility levels in the specified recreational areas.  The visibility levels in 
these photographs were later converted to deciviews for the current analysis.  The survey 
data collected were used to estimate a WTP equation for improved visibility.  In addition to 
the visibility change variable, the estimating equation also included household income as an 
explanatory variable. 
The Chestnut and Rowe study did not measure values for visibility improvement in 
Class I areas outside the three regions.  Their study covered 86 of the 156 Class I areas in the 
United States.  We can infer the value of visibility changes in the other Class I areas by 
transferring values of visibility changes at Class I areas in the study regions.  A complete 
description of the benefits transfer method used to infer values for visibility changes in Class 
I areas outside the study regions is provided in the Benefits TSD for the Nonroad Diesel 
rulemaking (Abt Associates, 2003). 
                                                 
29 The Clean Air Act designates 156 national parks and wilderness areas as Class I areas for visibility 
protection.

Nonroad Diesel rulemaking (Abt Associates, 2003). 
  
 
 
135
The Chestnut and Rowe study (Chestnut and Rowe, 1990a; 1990b), although 
representing the best available estimates, has a number of limitations.  These include the 
following: 
 The age of the study (late 1980s) will increase the uncertainty about the 
correspondence of the estimated values to those that might be provided by current or 
future populations. 
 The survey focused only on populations in five states, so the application of the 
estimated values to populations outside those states requires that preferences of 
populations in the five surveyed states be similar to those of non-surveyed states. 
 There is an inherent difficulty in separating values expressed for visibility 
improvements from an overall value for improved air quality.  The Chestnut and 
Rowe study attempted to control for this by informing respondents that “other 
households are being asked about visibility, human health, and vegetation protections 
in urban areas and at national parks in other regions.”  However, most of the 
respondents did not feel that they were able to segregate visibility at national parks 
entirely from residential visibility and health effects. 
 It is not clear exactly what visibility improvements the respondents to the Chestnut 
and Rowe survey were valuing.  The WTP question asked about changes in average 
visibility, but the survey respondents were shown photographs of only summertime 
conditions, when visibility is generally at its worst.  It is possible that the respondents 
believed those visibility conditions held year-round, in which case they would have 
been valuing much larger overall improvements in visibility than what otherwise 
would be the case. For the purpose of the benefits analysis for this rule, EPA assumed 
that respondents provided values for changes in annual average visibility.  Because 
most policies will result in a shift in the distribution of visibility (usually affecting the 
worst days more than the best days), the annual average may not be the most relevant 
metric for policy analysis. 
 The survey did not include reminders of possible substitutes (e.g., visibility at other 
parks) or budget constraints.  These reminders are considered to be best practice for 
stated preference surveys. 
 The Chestnut and Rowe survey focused on visibility improvements in and around 
national parks and wilderness areas.  The survey also focused on visibility 
improvements of national parks in the southwest United States.  Given that national 
parks and wilderness areas exhibit unique characteristics, it is not clear whether the 
  
 
 
136
WTP estimate obtained from Chestnut and Rowe can be transferred to other national 
parks and wilderness areas, without introducing additional uncertainty. 
In general, the survey design and implementation reflect the period in which the 
survey was conducted.  Since that time, many improvements to the stated preference 
methodology have been developed.  As future survey efforts are completed, EPA will 
incorporate values for visibility improvements reflecting the improved survey designs. 
The estimated relationship from the Chestnut and Rowe study is only directly 
applicable to the populations represented by survey respondents.  EPA used benefits transfer 
methodology to extrapolate these results to the population affected by the reductions in 
precursor emissions associated with this rule.  A general WTP equation for improved 
visibility (measured in deciviews) was developed as a function of the baseline level of 
visibility, the magnitude of the visibility improvement, and household income.  The 
behavioral parameters of this equation were taken from analysis of the Chestnut and Rowe 
data.  These parameters were used to calibrate WTP for the visibility changes resulting from 
this rule.  The method for developing calibrated WTP functions is based on the approach 
developed by Smith et al. (2002).  Available evidence indicates that households are willing to 
pay more for a given visibility improvement as their income increases (Chestnut, 1997).  The 
benefits estimates here incorporate Chestnut’s estimate that a 1% increase in income is 
associated with a 0.9% increase in WTP for a given change in visibility.  A more detailed 
explanation of the visibility benefits methodology is provided in Appendix I of the PM 
NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
One major source of uncertainty for the visibility benefits estimate is the benefits 
transfer process used.  Judgments used to choose the functional form and key parameters of 
the estimating equation for WTP for the affected population could have significant effects on 
the size of the estimates.  Assumptions about how individuals respond to changes in visibility 
that are either very small or outside the range covered in the Chestnut and Rowe study could 
also affect the results. 
 In addition, our estimate of visibility benefits is incomplete.  For example, we 
anticipate improvement in visibility in residential areas within the Transport Rule region for 
which we are currently unable to monetize benefits, such as the Northeastern and Central 
  
 
 
137
regions of the U.S.  The value of visibility benefits in areas where we were unable to 
monetize benefits could also be substantial. EPA requests public comment on the approach 
taken here to quantify the monetary value of changes in visibility in Class I areas. 
5.4.4.9 Growth in WTP Reflecting National Income Growth Over Time 
Our analysis accounts for expected growth in real income over time.  Economic 
theory argues that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) will increase if 
real incomes increase.  There is substantial empirical evidence that the income elasticity31 of 
WTP for health risk reductions is positive, although there is uncertainty about its exact value. 
 Thus, as real income increases, the WTP for environmental improvements also increases.  
Although many analyses assume that the income elasticity of WTP is unit elastic (i.e., a 10% 
higher real income level implies a 10% higher WTP to reduce risk changes), empirical 
evidence suggests that income elasticity is substantially less than one and thus relatively 
inelastic.  As real income rises, the WTP value also rises but at a slower rate than real 
income. 
The effects of real income changes on WTP estimates can influence benefits 
estimates in two different ways:  through real income growth between the year a WTP study 
was conducted and the year for which benefits are estimated, and through differences in 
income between study populations and the affected populations at a particular time.  
Empirical evidence of the effect of real income on WTP gathered to date is based on studies 
examining the former.  The Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (EEAC) of the 
Science Advisory Board (SAB) advised EPA to adjust WTP for increases in real income over 
time but not to adjust WTP to account for cross-sectional income differences “because of the 
sensitivity of making such distinctions, and because of insufficient evidence available at 
present” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000a).  A recent advisory by another committee associated with 
the SAB, the Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis, has provided conflicting 
advice.  While agreeing with “the general principle that the willingness to pay to reduce 
mortality risks is likely to increase with growth in real income (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 
52)” and that  “The same increase should be assumed for the WTP for serious nonfatal health 
                                                 
31 Income elasticity is a common economic measure equal to the percentage change in WTP for a 1% change in 
income. 
  
 
 
138
effects (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 52),” they note that “given the limitations and 
uncertainties in the available empirical evidence, the Council does not support the use of the 
proposed adjustments for aggregate income growth as part of the primary analysis (U.S. 
EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 53).”  Until these conflicting advisories have been reconciled, EPA will 
continue to adjust valuation estimates to reflect income growth using the methods described 
below, while providing sensitivity analyses for alternative income growth adjustment factors. 
Based on a review of the available income elasticity literature, we adjusted the 
valuation of human health benefits upward to account for projected growth in real U.S. 
income.  Faced with a dearth of estimates of income elasticities derived from time-series 
studies, we applied estimates derived from cross-sectional studies in our analysis.  Details of 
the procedure can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999).  An abbreviated description of 
the procedure we used to account for WTP for real income growth between 1990 and 2014 is 
presented below. 
Reported income elasticities suggest that the severity of a health effect is a primary 
determinant of the strength of the relationship between changes in real income and WTP.  As 
such, we use different elasticity estimates to adjust the WTP for minor health effects, severe 
and chronic health effects, and premature mortality.  Note that because of the variety of 
empirical sources used in deriving the income elasticities, there may appear to be 
inconsistencies in the magnitudes of the income elasticities relative to the severity of the 
effects (a priori one might expect that more severe outcomes would show less income 
elasticity of WTP).  We have not imposed any additional restrictions on the empirical 
estimates of income elasticity. One explanation for the seeming inconsistency is the 
difference in timing of conditions.  WTP for minor illnesses is often expressed as a short 
term payment to avoid a single episode.  WTP for major illnesses and mortality risk 
reductions are based on longer term measures of payment (such as wages or annual income). 
 Economic theory suggests that relationships become more elastic as the length of time 
grows, reflecting the ability to adjust spending over a longer time period.  Based on this 
theory, it would be expected that WTP for reducing long term risks would be more elastic 
than WTP for reducing short term risks.  We also expect that the WTP for improved visibility 
in Class I areas would increase with growth in real income.  The relative magnitude of the 
income elasticity of WTP for visibility compared with those for health effects suggests that 
  
 
 
139
visibility is not as much of a necessity as health, thus, WTP is more elastic with respect to 
income.  The elasticity values used to adjust estimates of benefits in 2014 are presented in 
Table 5-12. 
Table 5-12:  Elasticity Values Used to Account for Projected Real Income Growtha

Visibility 0.90 
a      Derivation of estimates can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) and Chestnut (1997).  COI 
estimates are assigned an adjustment factor of 1.0. 
 
In addition to elasticity estimates, projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and populations from 1990 to 2020 are needed to adjust benefits to reflect real per capita 
income growth.  For consistency with the emissions and benefits modeling, we used national 
population estimates for the years 1990 to 1999 based on U.S. Census Bureau estimates 
(Hollman, Mulder, and Kallan, 2000).  These population estimates are based on application 
of a cohort-component model applied to 1990 U.S. Census data projections (U.S. Bureau of 
Census, 2000).  For the years between 2000 and 2014, we applied growth rates based on the 
U.S. Census Bureau projections to the U.S. Census estimate of national population in 2000.  
We used projections of real GDP provided in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) for the years 
1990 to 2010.32  We used projections of real GDP (in chained 1996 dollars) provided by 
Standard and Poor’s (2000) for the years 2010 to 2014.33 
Using the method outlined in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) and the population and 
income data described above, we calculated WTP adjustment factors for each of the elasticity 
estimates listed in Table 5-13.  Benefits for each of the categories (minor health effects,

tab2a.htm.) and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Economics and Budget Outlook.  Note that projections 
for 2007 to 2010 are based on average GDP growth rates between 1999 and 2007. 
33 In previous analyses, we used the Standard and Poor’s projections of GDP directly.  This led to an apparent 
discontinuity in the adjustment factors between 2010 and 2011.  We refined the method by applying the 
relative growth rates for GDP derived from the Standard and Poor’s projections to the 2010 projected GDP 
based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis projections. 
  
 
 
140
severe and chronic health effects, premature mortality, and visibility) are adjusted by 
multiplying the unadjusted benefits by the appropriate adjustment factor.    Note that, for 
premature mortality, we applied the income adjustment factor to the present discounted value 
of the stream of avoided mortalities occurring over the lag period.  Also note that because of 
a lack of data on the dependence of COI and income, and a lack of data on projected growth 
in average wages, no adjustments are made to benefits based on the COI approach or to work 
loss days and worker productivity.  This assumption leads us to underpredict benefits in 
future years because it is likely that increases in real U.S. income would also result in 
increased COI (due, for example, to increases in wages paid to medical workers) and 
increased cost of work loss days and lost worker productivity (reflecting that if worker 
incomes are higher, the losses resulting from reduced worker production would also be 
higher).

5.5 Unquantified Health and Welfare Benefits 
 
This analysis is limited by the available data and resources.  As such, we are not able 
to quantify several welfare benefit categories, as shown in Table 5-2.  In this section, we 
provide a qualitative assessment of some of the primary welfare benefit categories from 
reducing NO2 and SO2 emissions: health and ecosystem benefits of reducing nitrogen and 
sulfur emissions and deposition and vegetation benefits from reducing ozone.34  While we 
were unable to quantify how large these benefits might be as a result of the emission 
                                                 
34  Some quantitative estimates of the total value of certain recreational and environmental goods given current 
and historic emission levels are provided below. They do not reflect benefits that would accrue as a result of this 
result. However, these values would be expected to increase as emissions are decreased a result of this rule.   
  
 
 
141
reductions achieved by this rule , previous EPA assessments show that these benefits could 
be substantial (U.S. EPA, 2008f; U.S. EPA, 2009c; U.S. EPA, 2007b; U.S. EPA, 1999b).  
The omission of these endpoints from the monetized results should not imply that the 
impacts are small or unimportant.  
 
5.5.1 Ecosystem Services 
 
Ecosystem services can be generally defined as the benefits that individuals and 
organizations obtain from ecosystems.  EPA has defined ecological goods and services as the 
“outputs of ecological functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to social 
welfare or have the potential to do so in the future.  Some outputs may be bought and sold, 
but most are not marketed” (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  Figure 5-5 provides the Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment’s schematic demonstrating the connections between the categories of 
ecosystem services and human well-being.  The interrelatedness of these categories means 
that any one ecosystem may provide multiple services.  Changes in these services can affect 
human well-being by affecting security, health, social relationships, and access to basic 
material goods (MEA, 2005).  
In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005), ecosystem services are 
classified into four main categories: 
1. Provisioning: Products obtained from ecosystems, such as the production of food and 
water 
2. Regulating: Benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as the 
control of climate and disease 
3. Cultural: Nonmaterial benefits that people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual 
enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences 
4. Supporting: Services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services, 
such as nutrient cycles and crop pollination 
  
 
 
142
Figure 5-5:  Linkages between categories of ecosystem services and components of 
human well-being from Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005) 
 
 
The monetization of ecosystem services generally involves estimating the value of 
ecological goods and services based on what people are willing to pay (WTP) to increase 
ecological services or by what people are willing to accept (WTA) in compensation for 
reductions in them (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  There are three primary approaches for estimating 
the monetary value of ecosystem services: market-based approaches, revealed preference 
methods, and stated preference methods (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  Because economic valuation of 
ecosystem services can be difficult, nonmonetary valuation using biophysical measurements 
and concepts also can be used.  An example of a nonmonetary valuation method is the use of 
relative-value indicators (e.g., a flow chart indicating uses of a water body, such as boatable, 
fishable, swimmable, etc.).  It is necessary to recognize that in the analysis of the 
environmental responses associated with any particular policy or environmental management 
action, only a subset of the ecosystem services likely to be affected are readily identified.  Of 
those ecosystem services that are identified, only a subset of the changes can be quantified.  
Within those services whose changes can be quantified, only a few will likely be monetized, 
and many will remain nonmonetized.  The stepwise concept leading up to the valuation of 
ecosystems services is graphically depicted in Figure 5-6.

5.5.2 Ecosystem Benefits of Reduced Nitrogen and Sulfur Deposition 
 
5.5.2.1 Science of Deposition 
 
Nitrogen and sulfur emissions occur over large regions of North America.  Once 
these pollutants are lofted to the middle and upper troposphere, they typically have a much 
longer lifetime and, with the generally stronger winds at these altitudes, can be transported 
long distances from their source regions. The length scale of this transport is highly variable 
owing to differing chemical and meteorological conditions encountered along the transport 
path (U.S. EPA, 2008f)..  Sulfur is primarily emitted as SO2, and nitrogen can be emitted as 
NO, NO2, or NH3.  Secondary particles are formed from NOx and SOX gaseous emissions and 
associated chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  Deposition can occur in either a wet (i.e., 
rain, snow, sleet, hail, clouds, or fog) or dry form (i.e., gases or particles).  Together these 
emissions are deposited onto terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the U.S., contributing 
to the problems of acidification, nutrient enrichment, and methylmercury production as 
represented in Figure 5-7.  Although there is some evidence that nitrogen deposition may 
have positive effects on agricultural and forest output through passive fertilization, it is likely 
that the overall value is very small relative to other health and welfare effects.

  The lifetimes of particles vary with particle size.  Accumulation-mode particles such 
as sulfates are kept in suspension by normal air motions and have a lower deposition velocity 
than coarse-mode particles; they can be transported thousands of kilometers and remain in 
the atmosphere for a number of days.  They are removed from the atmosphere primarily by 
cloud processes.  Particulates affect acid deposition by serving as cloud condensation nuclei 
and contribute directly to the acidification of rain.  In addition, the gas-phase species that

lead to the dry deposition of acidity are also precursors of particles.  Therefore, reductions in 
NO2 and SO2 emissions will decrease both acid deposition and PM concentrations, but not 
necessarily in a linear fashion.  (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Sulfuric acid is also deposited on 
surfaces by dry deposition and can contribute to environmental effects (U.S. EPA, 2008f).   
 
5.5.2.2 Ecological Effects of Acidification  
 
Deposition of nitrogen and sulfur can cause acidification, which alters 
biogeochemistry and affects animal and plant life in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across 
the U.S.  Soil acidification is a natural process, but is often accelerated by acidifying 
deposition, which can decrease concentrations of exchangeable base cations in soils (U.S. 
EPA, 2008f). Major terrestrial effects include a decline in sensitive tree species, such as red 
spruce (Picea rubens) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Biological 
effects of acidification in terrestrial ecosystems are generally linked to aluminum toxicity and 
decreased ability of plant roots to take up base cations (U.S. EPA, 2008f). Decreases in the 
acid neutralizing capacity and increases in inorganic aluminum concentration contribute to 
declines in zooplankton, macro invertebrates, and fish species richness in aquatic ecosystems 
(U.S. EPA, 2008f).   
Geology (particularly surficial geology) is the principal factor governing the 
sensitivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to acidification from nitrogen and sulfur 
deposition (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Geologic formations having low base cation supply generally 
underlie the watersheds of acid-sensitive lakes and streams.  Other factors contribute to the 
sensitivity of soils and surface waters to acidifying deposition, including topography, soil 
chemistry, land use, and hydrologic flow path (U.S. EPA, 2008f). 
 
5.5.2.3 Aquatic Ecosystems 
 
Aquatic effects of acidification have been well studied in the U.S. and elsewhere at 
various trophic levels.  These studies indicate that aquatic biota have been affected by 
acidification at virtually all levels of the food web in acid sensitive aquatic ecosystems.  
Effects have been most clearly documented for fish, aquatic insects, other invertebrates, and 
algae.  Biological effects are primarily attributable to a combination of low pH and high 
  
 
 
146
inorganic aluminum concentrations.  Such conditions occur more frequently during rainfall 
and snowmelt that cause high flows of water and less commonly during low-flow conditions, 
except where chronic acidity conditions are severe.  Biological effects of episodes include 
reduced fish condition factor35, changes in species composition and declines in aquatic 
species richness across multiple taxa, ecosystems and regions.  These conditions may also 
result in direct fish mortality (Van Sickle et al., 1996).  Biological effects in aquatic 
ecosystems can be divided into two major categories: effects on health, vigor, and 
reproductive success; and effects on biodiversity. Surface water with ANC values greater 
than 50 μeq/L generally provides moderate protection for most fish (i.e., brook trout, others) 
and other aquatic organisms (U.S. EPA, 2009c).  Table 5-14 provides a summary of the 
biological effects experienced at various ANC levels. 
                                                 
35 Condition factor is an index that describes the relationship between fish weight and length, and is one 
measure of sublethal acidification stress that has been used to quantify effects of acidification on an individual 
fish (U.S.EPA, 2008f).

Fish species richness is greatly reduced (i.e., more than half of expected

Diversity and distribution of zooplankton communities decline. 
Moderate 
Concern

Fish species richness begins to decline (i.e., sensitive species are lost from

sublethal effects.  Diversity and distribution of zooplankton communities also 
begin to decline as species that are sensitive to acidifying deposition are 
affected. 
Low 
Concern 
>100 μeq/L 
Fish species richness may be unaffected.  Reproducing brook trout 
populations are expected where habitat is suitable.  Zooplankton communities 
are unaffected and exhibit expected diversity and distribution. 
 
A number of national and regional assessments have been conducted to estimate the 
distribution and extent of surface water acidity in the U.S (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  As a result, 
several regions of the U.S. have been identified as containing a large number of lakes and 
streams that are seriously impacted by acidification.  Figure 5-8 illustrates those areas of the 
U.S. where aquatic ecosystems are at risk from acidification.

Figure 5-8: Areas Potentially Sensitive to Aquatic Acidification (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
  
Because acidification primarily affects the diversity and abundance of aquatic biota, it 
also affects the ecosystem services that are derived from the fish and other aquatic life found 
in these surface waters. 
While acidification is unlikely to have serious negative effects on, for example, water 
supplies, it can limit the productivity of surface waters as a source of food (i.e., fish).  In the 
northeastern United States, the surface waters affected by acidification are not a major source 
of commercially raised or caught fish; however, they are a source of food for some 
recreational and subsistence fishermen and for other consumers.  For example, there is 
evidence that certain population subgroups in the northeastern United States, such as the 
Hmong and Chippewa ethnic groups, have particularly high rates of self-caught fish 
consumption (Hutchison and Kraft, 1994; Peterson et al., 1994).  However, it is not known if 
and how their consumption patterns are affected by the reductions in available fish 
populations caused by surface water acidification. 
  
 
 
149
Inland surface waters support several cultural services, including aesthetic and 
educational services and recreational fishing.  Recreational fishing in lakes and streams is 
among the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the northeastern United States.  
Based on studies conducted in the northeastern United States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) 
estimated average consumer surplus values per day of $36 for recreational fishing (in 2007 
dollars); therefore, the implied total annual value of freshwater fishing in the northeastern 
United States was $5.1 billion in 2006.36  For recreation days, consumer surplus value is most 
commonly measured using recreation demand, travel cost models.  
Another estimate of the overarching ecological benefits associated with reducing lake 
acidification levels in Adirondacks National Park can be derived from the contingent 
valuation (CV) survey (Banzhaf et al., 2006), which elicited values for specific 
improvements in acidification-related water quality and ecological conditions in Adirondack 
lakes.  The survey described a base version with minor improvements said to result from the 
program, and a scope version with large improvements due to the program and a gradually 
worsening status quo.  After adapting and transferring the results of this study and converting 
the 10-year annual payments to permanent annual payments using discount rates of 3% and 
5%, the WTP estimates ranged from $48 to $107 per year per household (in 2004 dollars) for 
the base version and $54 to $154 for the scope version.  Using these estimates, the aggregate 
annual benefits of eliminating all anthropogenic sources of NOx and SOx emissions were 
estimated to range from $291 million to $829 million (U.S. EPA, 2009c).37 
In addition, inland surface waters provide a number of regulating services associated 
with hydrological and climate regulation by providing environments that sustain aquatic food 
webs.  These services are disrupted by the toxic effects of acidification on fish and other 
aquatic life.  Although it is difficult to quantify these services and how they are affected by 
acidification, some of these services may be captured through measures of provisioning and 
cultural services.  
                                                 
36 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

5.5.2.4 Terrestrial Ecosystems 
 
Acidifying deposition has altered major biogeochemical processes in the U.S. by 
increasing the nitrogen and sulfur content of soils, accelerating nitrate and sulfate leaching 
from soil to drainage waters, depleting base cations (especially calcium and magnesium) 
from soils, and increasing the mobility of aluminum.  Inorganic aluminum is toxic to some 
tree roots.  Plants affected by high levels of aluminum from the soil often have reduced root 
growth, which restricts the ability of the plant to take up water and nutrients, especially 
calcium (U. S. EPA, 2008f).  These direct effects can, in turn, influence the response of these 
plants to climatic stresses such as droughts and cold temperatures.  They can also influence 
the sensitivity of plants to other stresses, including insect pests and disease (Joslin et al., 
1992) leading to increased mortality of canopy trees.  In the U.S., terrestrial effects of 
acidification are best described for forested ecosystems (especially red spruce and sugar 
maple ecosystems) with additional information on other plant communities, including shrubs 
and lichen (U.S. EPA, 2008f).   
Certain ecosystems in the continental U.S. are potentially sensitive to terrestrial 
acidification, which is the greatest concern regarding nitrogen and sulfur deposition U.S. 
EPA (2008f).  Figure 5-9 depicts the areas across the U.S. that are potentially sensitive to 
terrestrial acidification.  
  
 
 
151
Figure 5-9: Areas Potentially Sensitive to Terrestrial Acidification (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
 
 
Both coniferous and deciduous forests throughout the eastern U.S. are experiencing 
gradual losses of base cation nutrients from the soil due to accelerated leaching from 
acidifying deposition.  This change in nutrient availability may reduce the quality of forest 
nutrition over the long term.  Evidence suggests that red spruce and sugar maple in some 
areas in the eastern U.S. have experienced declining health because of this deposition.  For 
red spruce, (Picea rubens) dieback or decline has been observed across high elevation 
landscapes of the northeastern U.S., and to a lesser extent, the southeastern U.S., and 
acidifying deposition has been implicated as a causal factor (DeHayes et al., 1999).  Figure 
5-10 shows the distribution of red spruce (brown) and sugar maple (green) in the eastern U.S.

U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
  
Terrestrial acidification affects several important ecological endpoints, including 
declines in habitat for threatened and endangered species (cultural), declines in forest 
aesthetics (cultural), declines in forest productivity (provisioning), and increases in forest soil 
erosion and reductions in water retention (cultural and regulating). 
Forests in the northeastern United States provide several important and valuable 
provisioning services in the form of tree products.  Sugar maples are a particularly important 
commercial hardwood tree species, providing timber and maple syrup.  In the United States, 
sugar maple saw timber was nearly 900 million board feet in 2006 (USFS, 2006), and annual 
production of maple syrup was nearly 1.4 million gallons, accounting for approximately 19% 
of worldwide production.  The total annual value of U.S. production in these years was 
approximately $160 million (NASS, 2008).  Red spruce is also used in a variety of products 
including lumber, pulpwood, poles, plywood, and musical instruments.  The total removal of 
red spruce saw timber from timberland in the United States was over 300 million board feet 
in 2006 (USFS, 2006).  
  
 
 
153
Forests in the northeastern United States are also an important source of cultural 
ecosystem services—nonuse (i.e., existence value for threatened and endangered species), 
recreational, and aesthetic services.  Red spruce forests are home to two federally listed 
species and one delisted species: 
1. Spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga)—endangered 
2. Rock gnome lichen (Gymnoderma lineare)—endangered 
3. Virginia northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus)—delisted, but 
important 
 
Forestlands support a wide variety of outdoor recreational activities, including 
fishing, hiking, camping, off-road driving, hunting, and wildlife viewing.  Regional statistics 
on recreational activities that are specifically forest based are not available; however, more 
general data on outdoor recreation provide some insights into the overall level of recreational 
services provided by forests.  More than 30% of the U.S. adult population visited a 
wilderness or primitive area during the previous year and engaged in day hiking (Cordell et 
al., 2008).  From 1999 to 2004, 16% of adults in the northeastern United States participated 
in off-road vehicle recreation, for an average of 27 days per year (Cordell et al., 2005).  The 
average consumer surplus value per day of off-road driving in the United States was $25 (in 
2007 dollars), and the implied total annual value of off-road driving recreation in the 
northeastern United States was more than $9 billion (Kaval and Loomis, 2003).  More than 
5% of adults in the northeastern United States participated in nearly 84 million hunting days 
(U.S. FWS and U.S. Census Bureau, 2007).  Ten percent of adults in northeastern states 
participated in wildlife viewing away from home on 122 million days in 2006.  For these 
recreational activities in the northeastern United States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) estimated 
average consumer surplus values per day of $52 for hunting and $34 for wildlife viewing (in 
2007 dollars).  The implied total annual value of hunting and wildlife viewing in the 
northeastern United States was, therefore, $4.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, in 2006. 
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to estimate the portion of these recreational 
services that are specifically attributable to forests and to the health of specific tree species.  
However, one recreational activity that is directly dependent on forest conditions is fall color 
viewing.  Sugar maple trees, in particular, are known for their bright colors and are, 
  
 
 
154
therefore, an essential aesthetic component of most fall color landscapes.  A survey of 
residents in the Great Lakes area found that roughly 30% of residents reported at least one 
trip in the previous year involving fall color viewing (Spencer and Holecek, 2007).  In a 
separate study conducted in Vermont, Brown (2002) reported that more than 22% of 
households visiting Vermont in 2001 made the trip primarily for viewing fall colors.  
Two studies estimated values for protecting high-elevation spruce forests in the 
southern Appalachian Mountains.  Kramer et al. (2003) conducted a contingent valuation 
study estimating households’ WTP for programs to protect remaining high-elevation spruce 
forests from damages associated with air pollution and insect infestation.  Median household 
WTP was estimated to be roughly $29 (in 2007 dollars) for a smaller program, and $44 for 
the more extensive program.  Jenkins et al. (2002) conducted a very similar study in seven 
Southern Appalachian states on a potential program to maintain forest conditions at status 
quo levels.  The overall mean annual WTP for the forest protection programs was $208 (in 
2007 dollars).  Multiplying the average WTP estimate from these studies by the total number 
of households in the seven-state Appalachian region results in an aggregate annual range of 
$470 million to $3.4 billion for avoiding a significant decline in the health of high-elevation 
spruce forests in the Southern Appalachian region.38 
Forests in the northeastern United States also support and provide a wide variety of 
valuable regulating services, including soil stabilization and erosion control, water 
regulation, and climate regulation.  The total value of these ecosystem services is very 
difficult to quantify in a meaningful way, as is the reduction in the value of these services 
associated with total nitrogen and sulfur deposition.  As terrestrial acidification contributes to 
root damages, reduced biomass growth, and tree mortality, all of these services are likely to 
be affected; however, the magnitude of these impacts is currently very uncertain. 
 
5.5.3 Ecological Effects Associated with the Role of Sulfate in Mercury Methylation          
 
Mercury is a highly neurotoxic contaminant that enters the food web as a methylated 
compound, methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  The contaminant is concentrated in higher 
                                                 
38 These estimates reflect the marginal value of the service for the hypothetical program described in the survey, 
not the marginal change in the value of the service as a result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule. 
  
 
 
155
trophic levels, including fish eaten by humans.  Experimental evidence has established that 
only inconsequential amounts of methylmercury can be produced in the absence of sulfate 
(U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Many variables influence how much mercury accumulates in fish, but 
elevated mercury levels in fish can only occur where substantial amounts of methylmercury 
are present (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Current evidence indicates that in watersheds where mercury 
is present, increased sulfate deposition very likely results in methylmercury accumulation in 
fish (Drevnick et al., 2007; Munthe et al., 2007).  The ISA for Oxides of Nitrogen and Sulfur: 
Ecological Criteria ISA concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a casual relationship 
between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and aquatic 
environments (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  
 
Establishing the quantitative relationship between sulfate and mercury methylation in 
natural settings is difficult because of the presence of multiple interacting factors in aquatic 
and terrestrial environments, including wetlands, aquatic environments where sulfate, sulfur-
reducing bacteria (SRB), and inorganic mercury are present (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  These are 
the three primary requirements for bacterially-mediated conversion to methylmercury.  
Additional factors affecting conversion include the presence of anoxic conditions, 
temperature, the presence and types of organic matter, the presence and types of mercury-
binding species, and watershed effects (e.g., watershed type, land cover, water body 
limnology, and runoff loading).  With regard to methylmercury, the highest concentrations in 
the environment generally occur at or near the sedimentary surface, below the oxic–anoxic 
boundary.  Although mercury methylation can occur within the water column, there is 
generally a far greater contribution of mercury methylation from sediments because of 
anoxia and of greater concentrations of SRB, substrate, and sulfate.  Figure 5-15 depicts the 
mercury cycle.   
 
  
 
 
156

Figure 5-16 illustrates a map of mercury-sensitive watersheds based on sulfate 
concentrations, ANC, levels of dissolved organic carbon and pH, mercury species 
concentrations, and soil types to gauge the methylation sensitivity (Myers et al., 2007). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
157

(Myers et al., 2007) 
 
 
 
Decreases in sulfate deposition/emissions have already shown reductions in 
methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Observed decreases in methylmercury fish tissue 
concentrations have been linked to decreased acidification and declining sulfate and mercury 
deposition (Hrabik and Watras, 2002; Drevnick et al., 2007).  
 
In the U.S., consumption of fish and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury 
exposure to humans.  Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than 
in others.  The levels of methylmercury in high and shellfish vary widely depending on what 
they eat, how long they live, and how high they are in the food chain.  Most fish, including 
ocean species and local freshwater fish, contain some methylmercury.  For example, in 
recent studies by EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) of fish tissues, every fish 
samples contained some methylmercury. 
 
  
 
 
158
State-level fish consumption advisories for mercury are based on state criteria, many 
of which are based on EPA’s fish tissue criterion for methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2001) or on 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s action levels (U.S. FDA, 2001). In 2008, there were 
3,361 fish advisories issued at least in part for mercury contamination (80% of all fish 
advisories), covering 16.8 million lake acres (40% of total lake acreage) and 1.3 million river 
miles (35% of total river miles) over all 50 states, one U.S. territory, and 3 tribes (U.S. EPA, 
2009f).  Recently, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) examined mercury levels in top-
predator fish, bed sediment, and water from 291 streams across the U.S. (Scudder et al., 
2009).  USGS detected mercury contamination in every fish sampled, and the concentration 
of mercury in fish exceeded EPA’s criterion in 27% of the sites sampled.   
 
  The ecosystem service most directly affected by sulfate-mediated mercury 
methylation is the provision of fish for consumption as a food source.  This service is of 
particular importance to groups engaged in subsistence fishing, pregnant women and young 
children.  While it is not possible to quantify the reduction in fish consumption due to the 
presence of methylmercury in fish from sulfur deposition, it is likely, given the number of 
state advisories and the EPA/FDA guidelines (U.S. EPA/FDA, 2004) on consumption for 
pregnant women and young children, that this service is negatively affected.  
 
Research shows that most people’s fish consumption does not cause a mercury-
related health concern.  However, certain people may be at higher risk because of their 
routinely high consumption of fish (e.g., tribal and other subsistence fishers and their 
families who rely heavily on fish for a substantial part of their diet).  It has been 
demonstrated that high levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and 
young children may harm the developing nervous system, making the child less able to think 
and learn. Moreover, mercury exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, 
lungs, and immune system of people of all ages.  The majority of fish consumed in the U.S. 
are ocean species.  The methylmercury concentrations in ocean fish species are primarily 
  
 
 
159
influences by the global mercury pool.  However, the methylmercury found in local fish can 
be due, at least partly, to mercury emissions from local sources.   
 
Several studies suggest that the methylmercury content of fish may reduce these 
cardio-protective effects of fish consumption.  Some of these studies also suggest that 
methylmercury may cause adverse effects to the cardiovascular system.  For example, the 
NRC (2000) review of the literature concerning methylmercury health effects took note of 
two epidemiological studies that found an association between dietary exposure to 
methylmercury and adverse cardiovascular effects.39  Moreover, in a study of 1,833 males in 
Finland aged 42 to 60 years, Solonen et al. (1995) observed a relationship between 
methylmercury exposure via fish consumption and acute myocardial infarction (AMI or heart 
attacks), coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.40  The NRC 
also noted a study of 917 seven year old children in the Faroe Islands, whose initial exposure 
to methylmercury was in utero although post natal exposures may have occurred as well.  At 
seven years of age, these children exhibited an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in 
heart rate variability.41 Based on these and other studies, NRC concluded in 2000 that, while 
“the data base is not as extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is for other end points (i.e. 
neurologic effects) the cardiovascular system appears to be a target for methylmercury 
toxicity.”42   
 
 Since publication of the NRC report there have been some 30 published papers

presenting the findings of studies that have examined the possible cardiovascular effects of 
methylmercury exposure.  These studies include epidemiological, toxicological, and 
toxicokinetic investigations.  Over a dozen review papers have also been published.   If there 
is a causal relationship between methylmercury exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects, 
then reducing exposure to methylmercury would result in public health benefits from reduced 
cardiovascular effects. 
 
In early 2010, EPA sponsored a workshop in which a group of experts were asked to 
assess the plausibility of a causal relationship between methylmercury exposure and 
cardiovascular health effects and to advise EPA on methodologies for estimating population 
level cardiovascular health impacts of reduced methylmercury exposure. The report from that 
workshop is in preparation. 
 
Because establishing the quantitative relationship between sulfate and mercury 
methylation in natural settings is difficult, we were unable to model the changes in the 
methylation process, bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and human consumption of mercury-
contaminated fish that would be needed in order to estimate the human health benefits from 
reducing sulfate emissions in this rule.  
 
5.5.4 Ecological Effects Associated with Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide   
 
Uptake of gaseous sulfur dioxide in a plant canopy is a complex process involving 
adsorption to surfaces (leaves, stems, and soil) and absorption into leaves.  SO2 penetrates 
into leaves through to the stomata, although there is evidence for limited pathways via the 
cuticle.  Pollutants must be transported from the bulk air to the leaf boundary layer in order 
to get to the stomata.  When the stomata are closed, as occurs under dark or drought 
conditions, resistance to gas uptake is very high and the plant has a very low degree of 
susceptibility to injury.  In contrast, mosses and lichens do not have a protective cuticle 
barrier to gaseous pollutants or stomates and are generally more sensitive to gaseous sulfur 
and nitrogen than vascular plants (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Acute foliar injury usually happens 
  
 
 
161
within hours of exposure, involves a rapid absorption of a toxic dose, and involves collapse 
or necrosis of plant tissues.  Another type of visible injury is termed chronic injury and is 
usually a result of variable SO2 exposures over the growing season.  Besides foliar injury, 
chronic exposure to low SO2 concentrations can result in reduced photosynthesis, growth, 
and yield of plants (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  These effects are cumulative over the season and are 
often not associated with visible foliar injury.  As with foliar injury, these effects vary among 
species and growing environment.  SO2 is also considered the primary factor causing the 
death of lichens in many urban and industrial areas (Hutchinson et al., 1996).  
In addition to the role of sulfate deposition on methylation, the technologies installed 
to reduce emissions of NOx and SO2 associated with this proposed rule would also reduce 
mercury emissions. EPA recently commissioned an information collection request that will 
soon provide greatly improved power industry mercury emissions estimates that will enable 
the Agency to better estimate mercury emissions changes from its air emissions control 
actions. For this reason, the Agency did not estimate Hg changes in this rule and will instead 
wait for these new data which will be available in the near future. Due to time and resource 
limitations, we were unable in any event to model mercury dispersion, deposition, 
methylation, bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and human consumption of mercury-
contaminated fish that would be needed in order to estimate the human health benefits from 
reducing these mercury emissions. 
 
5.5.5 Nitrogen Enrichment 
 
5.5.5.1 Aquatic Enrichment 
 
One of the main adverse ecological effects resulting from N deposition, particularly 
in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, is the effect associated with nutrient 
enrichment in estuarine waters.  A recent assessment of 141 estuaries nationwide by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that 19 estuaries 
(13%) suffered from moderately high or high levels of eutrophication due to excessive inputs 
of both N and phosphorus, and a majority of these estuaries are located in the coastal area 
from North Carolina to Massachusetts (NOAA, 2007).  For estuaries in the Mid-Atlantic 
  
 
 
162
region, the contribution of atmospheric distribution to total N loads is estimated to range 
between 10% and 58% (Valigura et al., 2001).  
Eutrophication in estuaries is associated with a range of adverse ecological effects.  
The conceptual framework developed by NOAA emphasizes four main types of 
eutrophication effects—low dissolved oxygen (DO), harmful algal blooms (HABs), loss of 
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and low water clarity.  Low DO disrupts aquatic 
habitats, causing stress to fish and shellfish, which, in the short-term, can lead to episodic 
fish kills and, in the long-term, can damage overall growth in fish and shellfish populations.  
Low DO also degrades the aesthetic qualities of surface water.  In addition to often being 
toxic to fish and shellfish, and leading to fish kills and aesthetic impairments of estuaries, 
HABs can, in some instances, also be harmful to human health.  SAV provides critical 
habitat for many aquatic species in estuaries and, in some instances, can also protect 
shorelines by reducing wave strength; therefore, declines in SAV due to nutrient enrichment 
are an important source of concern.  Low water clarity is the result of accumulations of both 
algae and sediments in estuarine waters.  In addition to contributing to declines in SAV, high 
levels of turbidity also degrade the aesthetic qualities of the estuarine environment.  
Estuaries in the eastern United States are an important source of food production, in 
particular fish and shellfish production.  The estuaries are capable of supporting large stocks 
of resident commercial species, and they serve as the breeding grounds and interim habitat 
for several migratory species.  To provide an indication of the magnitude of provisioning 
services associated with coastal fisheries, from 2005 to 2007, the average value of total catch 
was $1.5 billion per year.  It is not known, however, what percentage of this value is directly 
attributable to or dependent upon the estuaries in these states.   
In addition to affecting provisioning services through commercial fish harvests, 
eutrophication in estuaries may also affect the demand for seafood.  For example, a well-
publicized toxic pfiesteria bloom in the Maryland Eastern Shore in 1997, which involved 
thousands of dead and lesioned fish, led to an estimated $56 million (in 2007 dollars) in lost 
seafood sales for 360 seafood firms in Maryland in the months following the outbreak 
(Lipton, 1999).  
  
 
 
163
Estuaries in the United States also provide an important and substantial variety of 
cultural ecosystem services, including water-based recreational and aesthetic services.  The 
water quality in the estuary directly affects the quality of these experiences. For example, 
there were 26 million days of saltwater fishing coastal states from North Carolina to 
Massachusetts in 2006 (FWA and Census, 2007).  Assuming an average consumer surplus 
value for a fishing day at $36 (in 2007 dollars) in the Northeast and $87 in the Southeast 
(Kaval and Loomis, 2003), the aggregate value was approximately $1.3 billion (in 2007 
dollars). 43 In addition, almost 6 million adults participated in motorboating in coastal states 
from North Carolina to Massachusetts, for a total of nearly 63 million days annually during 
1999–2000 (Leeworthy and Wiley, 2001).  Using a national daily value estimate of $32 (in 
2007 dollars) for motorboating (Kaval and Loomis (2003), the aggregate value of these 
coastal motorboating outings was $2 billion per year. 44  Almost 7 million participated in 
birdwatching for 175 million days per year, and more than 3 million participated in visits to 
non-beach coastal waterside areas.  
Estuaries and marshes have the potential to support a wide range of regulating 
services, including climate, biological, and water regulation; pollution detoxification; erosion 
prevention; and protection against natural hazards from declines in SAV (MEA, 2005).  SAV 
can help reduce wave energy levels and thus protect shorelines against excessive erosion, 
which increases the risks of episodic flooding and associated damages to near-shore 
properties or public infrastructure or even contribute to shoreline retreat.  
5.5.5.2 Terrestrial Enrichment 
 
Terrestrial enrichment occurs when terrestrial ecosystems receive N loadings in excess 
of natural background levels, either through atmospheric deposition or direct application.  
Evidence presented in the Integrated Science Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2008f) supports a causal 
relationship between atmospheric N deposition and biogeochemical cycling and fluxes of N 
and carbon in terrestrial systems.  Furthermore, evidence summarized in the report supports a 
causal link between atmospheric N deposition and changes in the types and number of species 
                                                 
43 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.   
44 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.   
  
 
 
164
and biodiversity in terrestrial systems.  Nitrogen enrichment occurs over a long time period; as 
a result, it may take as much as 50 years or more to see changes in ecosystem conditions and 
indicators.  This long time scale also affects the timing of the ecosystem service changes. 
One of the main provisioning services potentially affected by N deposition is grazing 
opportunities offered by grasslands for livestock production in the Central U.S.  Although N 
deposition on these grasslands can offer supplementary nutritive value and promote overall 
grass production, there are concerns that fertilization may favor invasive grasses and shift the 
species composition away from native grasses. This process may ultimately reduce the 
productivity of grasslands for livestock production.  Losses due to invasive grasses can be 
significant; for example, based on a bioeconomic model of cattle grazing in the upper Great 
Plains, Leitch, Leistritz, and Bangsund (1996) and Leistritz, Bangsund, and Hodur (2004) 
estimated $130 million in losses due to a leafy spurge infestation in the Dakotas, Montana, 
and Wyoming. 45 However, the contribution of N deposition to these losses is still uncertain.  
 
5.5.6 Benefits of Reducing Ozone Effects on Vegetation and Ecosystems 
 
Ozone causes discernible injury to a wide array of vegetation (U.S. EPA, 2006a; Fox 
and Mickler, 1996).  In terms of forest productivity and ecosystem diversity, ozone may be 
the pollutant with the greatest potential for regional-scale forest impacts (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  
Studies have demonstrated repeatedly that ozone concentrations commonly observed in 
polluted areas can have substantial impacts on plant function (De Steiguer et al., 1990; Pye, 
1988). 
When ozone is present in the air, it can enter the leaves of plants, where it can cause 
significant cellular damage.  Like carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gaseous substances, ozone 
enters plant tissues primarily through the stomata in leaves in a process called “uptake” 
(Winner and Atkinson, 1986).  Once sufficient levels of ozone (a highly reactive substance), 
or its reaction products, reaches the interior of plant cells, it can inhibit or damage essential 
cellular components and functions, including enzyme activities, lipids, and cellular 
membranes, disrupting the plant's osmotic (i.e., water) balance and energy utilization patterns 
                                                 
45 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.   
  
 
 
165
(U.S. EPA, 2006a; Tingey and Taylor, 1982).  With fewer resources available, the plant 
reallocates existing resources away from root growth and storage, above ground growth or 
yield, and reproductive processes, toward leaf repair and maintenance, leading to reduced 
growth and/or reproduction.  Studies have shown that plants stressed in these ways may 
exhibit a general loss of vigor, which can lead to secondary impacts that modify plants' 
responses to other environmental factors.  Specifically, plants may become more sensitive to 
other air pollutants, or more susceptible to disease, pest infestation, harsh weather (e.g., 
drought, frost) and other environmental stresses, which can all produce a loss in plant vigor 
in ozone-sensitive species that over time may lead to premature plant death.  Furthermore, 
there is evidence that ozone can interfere with the formation of mycorrhiza, essential 
symbiotic fungi associated with the roots of most terrestrial plants, by reducing the amount 
of carbon available for transfer from the host to the symbiont (U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
This ozone damage may or may not be accompanied by visible injury on leaves, and 
likewise, visible foliar injury may or may not be a symptom of the other types of plant 
damage described above.  Foliar injury is usually the first visible sign of injury to plants from 
ozone exposure and indicates impaired physiological processes in the leaves (Grulke, 2003). 
 When visible injury is present, it is commonly manifested as chlorotic or necrotic spots, 
and/or increased leaf senescence (accelerated leaf aging).  Because ozone damage can consist 
of visible injury to leaves, it can also reduce the aesthetic value of ornamental vegetation and 
trees in urban landscapes, and negatively affects scenic vistas in protected natural areas.   
 Ozone can produce both acute and chronic injury in sensitive species depending on 
the concentration level and the duration of the exposure.  Ozone effects also tend to 
accumulate over the growing season of the plant, so that even lower concentrations 
experienced for a longer duration have the potential to create chronic stress on sensitive 
vegetation.  Not all plants, however, are equally sensitive to ozone.  Much of the variation in 
sensitivity between individual plants or whole species is related to the plant’s ability to 
regulate the extent of gas exchange via leaf stomata (e.g., avoidance of ozone uptake through 
closure of stomata) (U.S. EPA, 2006a; Winner, 1994).  After injuries have occurred, plants 
may be capable of repairing the damage to a limited extent (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  Because of 
the differing sensitivities among plants to ozone, ozone pollution can also exert a selective 
pressure that leads to changes in plant community composition.  Given the range of plant 
  
 
 
166
sensitivities and the fact that numerous other environmental factors modify plant uptake and 
response to ozone, it is not possible to identify threshold values above which ozone is 
consistently toxic for all plants.   
 Because plants are at the base of the food web in many ecosystems, changes to the 
plant community can affect associated organisms and ecosystems (including the suitability of 
habitats that support threatened or endangered species and below ground organisms living in 
the root zone).  Ozone impacts at the community and ecosystem level vary widely depending 
upon numerous factors, including concentration and temporal variation of tropospheric 
ozone, species composition, soil properties and climatic factors (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  In most 
instances, responses to chronic or recurrent exposure in forested ecosystems are subtle and 
not observable for many years.  These injuries can cause stand-level forest decline in 
sensitive ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2006a, McBride et al., 1985; Miller et al., 1982).  It is not 
yet possible to predict ecosystem responses to ozone with much certainty; however, 
considerable knowledge of potential ecosystem responses has been acquired through long-
term observations in highly damaged forests in the United States (U.S EPA, 2006a). 
5.5.6.1 Ozone Effects on Forests  
Air pollution can affect the environment and affect ecological systems, leading to 
changes in the ecological community and influencing the diversity, health, and vigor of 
individual species (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  Ozone has been shown in numerous studies to have a 
strong effect on the health of many plants, including a variety of commercial and ecologically 
important forest tree species throughout the United States (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 
In the U.S., this data comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest 
Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program.  As part of its Phase 3 program, 
formerly known as Forest Health Monitoring, FIA examines ozone injury to ozone-sensitive 
plant species at ground monitoring sites in forestland across the country (excluding woodlots 
and urban trees).  FIA looks for damage on the foliage of ozone-sensitive forest plant species 
at each site that meets certain minimum criteria.  Because ozone injury is cumulative over the 
course of the growing season, examinations are conducted in July and August, when ozone 
injury is typically highest.  
  
 
 
167
Monitoring of ozone injury to plants by the USDA Forest Service has expanded over 
the last 10 years from monitoring sites in 10 states in 1994 to nearly 1,000 monitoring sites in 
41 states in 2002.  The data underlying the indictor in Figure 5-13 are based on averages of 
all observations collected in 2002, the latest year for which data are publicly available at the 
time the study was conducted, and are broken down by U.S. EPA Regions.  Ozone damage to 
forest plants is classified using a subjective five-category biosite index based on expert 
opinion, but designed to be equivalent from site to site.  Ranges of biosite values translate to 
no injury, low or moderate foliar injury (visible foliar injury to highly sensitive or 
moderately sensitive plants, respectively), and high or severe foliar injury, which would be 
expected to result in tree-level or ecosystem-level responses, respectively (U.S. EPA, 2006a; 
Coulston, 2004).  The highest percentages of observed high and severe foliar injury, which 
are most likely to be associated with tree or ecosystem-level responses, are primarily found 
in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions.

  Assessing the impact of ground-level ozone on forests in the eastern United States 
involves understanding the risks to sensitive tree species from ambient ozone concentrations 
and accounting for the prevalence of those species within the forest.  As a way to quantify 
the risks to particular plants from ground-level ozone, scientists have developed ozone-
exposure/tree-response functions by exposing tree seedlings to different ozone levels and 
measuring reductions in growth as “biomass loss.”  Typically, seedlings are used because 
they are easy to manipulate and measure their growth loss from ozone pollution.  The 
mechanisms of susceptibility to ozone within the leaves of seedlings and mature trees are 
  
 
 
169
identical, and the decreases predicted using the seedlings should be related to the decrease in 
overall plant fitness for mature trees, but the magnitude of the effect may be higher or lower 
depending on the tree species (Chappelka and Samuelson, 1998).  In areas where certain 
ozone-sensitive species dominate the forest community, the biomass loss from ozone can be 
significant.  Significant biomass loss can be defined as a more than 2% annual biomass loss, 
which would cause long term ecological harm as the short-term negative effects on seedlings 
compound to affect long-term forest health (Heck, 1997). 
Some of the common tree species in the United States that are sensitive to ozone are 
black cherry (Prunus serotina), tulip-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and eastern white pine 
(Pinus strobus).  Ozone-exposure/tree-response functions have been developed for each of 
these tree species, as well as for aspen (Populus tremuliodes), and ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Other common tree species, such as oak (Quercus spp.) and 
hickory (Carya spp.), are not as sensitive to ozone.  Consequently, with knowledge of the 
distribution of sensitive species and the level of ozone at particular locations, it is possible to 
estimate a “biomass loss” for each species across their range.  As shown in Figure 5-14, 
current ambient levels of ozone are associated with significant biomass loss across large 
geographic areas (U.S. EPA, 2009b).  However, this information is unavailable this rule.    
To estimate the biomass loss for forest ecosystems across the eastern United States, 
the biomass loss for each of the seven tree species was calculated using the three-month, 12-
hour W126 exposure metric at each location, along with each tree’s individual C-R 
functions.  The W126 exposure metric was calculated using monitored ozone data from 
CASTNET and AQS sites, and a three-year average was used to mitigate the effect of 
variations in meteorological and soil moisture conditions.  The biomass loss estimate for 
each species was then multiplied by its prevalence in the forest community using the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service IV index of tree abundance calculated 
from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) measurements (Prasad, 2003).  Sources of 
uncertainty include the ozone-exposure/plant-response functions, the tree abundance index, 
and other factors (e.g., soil moisture).  Although these factors were not considered, they can 
affect ozone damage (Chappelka, 1998).

Pine, Virginia Pine, Red Maple, and Quaking Aspen Biomass Loss due to Current 
Ozone Exposure, 2006-2008 (U.S. EPA, 2009b) 
  
Ozone damage to the plants including the trees and understory in a forest can affect 
the ability of the forest to sustain suitable habitat for associated species particularly 
threatened and endangered species that have existence value – a nonuse ecosystem service - 
for the public.  Similarly, damage to trees and the loss of biomass can affect the forest’s 
provisioning services in the form of timber for various commercial uses.  In addition, ozone 
can cause discoloration of leaves and more rapid senescence (early shedding of leaves), 
which could negatively affect fall-color tourism because the fall foliage would be less 
available or less attractive.  Beyond the aesthetic damage to fall color vistas, forests provide 
the public with many other recreational and educational services that may be impacted by 
reduced forest health including hiking, wildlife viewing (including bird watching), camping, 
picnicking, and hunting.  Another potential effect of biomass loss in forests is the subsequent 
loss of climate regulation service in the form of reduced ability to sequester carbon (Felzer et 
al., 2005).  
  
 
 
171
5.5.6.2 Ozone Effects on Crops and Urban Ornamentals 
 
Laboratory and field experiments have also shown reductions in yields for agronomic 
crops exposed to ozone, including vegetables (e.g., lettuce) and field crops (e.g., cotton and 
wheat).  Damage to crops from ozone exposures includes yield losses (i.e., in terms of 
weight, number, or size of the plant part that is harvested), as well as changes in crop quality 
(i.e., physical appearance, chemical composition, or the ability to withstand storage) (U.S. 
EPA, 2007b).  The most extensive field experiments, conducted under the National Crop 
Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) examined 15 species and numerous cultivars.  The 
NCLAN results show that “several economically important crop species are sensitive to 
ozone levels typical of those found in the United States” (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  In addition, 
economic studies have shown reduced economic benefits as a result of predicted reductions 
in crop yields, directly affecting the amount and quality of the provisioning service provided 
by the crops in question, associated with observed ozone levels (Kopp et al., 1985; Adams et 
al., 1986; Adams et al., 1989).  According to the Ozone Staff Paper, there has been no 
evidence that crops are becoming more tolerant of ozone (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Using the 
Agriculture Simulation Model (AGSIM) (Taylor, 1994) to calculate the agricultural benefits 
of reductions in ozone exposure, U.S. EPA estimated that meeting a W126 standard of 21 
ppm-hr would produce monetized benefits of approximately $160 million to $300 million 
(inflated to 2006 dollars) (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 46 
Urban ornamentals are an additional vegetation category likely to experience some 
degree of negative effects associated with exposure to ambient ozone levels.  Because ozone 
causes visible foliar injury, the aesthetic value of ornamentals (such as petunia, geranium, 
and poinsettia) in urban landscapes would be reduced (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Sensitive 
ornamental species would require more frequent replacement and/or increased maintenance 
(fertilizer or pesticide application) to maintain the desired appearance because of exposure to 
ambient ozone (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  In addition, many businesses rely on healthy-looking 
vegetation for their livelihoods (e.g., horticulturalists, landscapers, Christmas tree growers, 
farmers of leafy crops, etc.) and a variety of ornamental species have been listed as sensitive 
                                                 
46 These estimates illustrate the value of vegetation effects from a substantial reduction of ozone concentrations, 
not the marginal change in ozone concentrations anticipated a result of the emission reductions achieved by this 
rule.   
  
 
 
172
to ozone (Abt Associates, 1995).  The ornamental landscaping industry is valued at more 
than $30 billion (inflated to 2006 dollars) annually, by both private property owners/tenants 
and by governmental units responsible for public areas (Abt Associates, 1995).  Therefore, 
urban ornamentals represent a potentially large unquantified benefit category.  This aesthetic 
damage may affect the enjoyment of urban parks by the public and homeowners’ enjoyment 
of their landscaping and gardening activities.  In the absence of adequate exposure-response 
functions and economic damage functions for the potential range of effects relevant to these 
types of vegetation, we cannot conduct a quantitative analysis to estimate these effects. 
5.5.7 Unquantified SO2 and NO2 -Related Human Health Benefits 
Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and 
laboratory studies, the Integrated Science Assessment for Sulfur Dioxide concluded that 
there is a causal relationship between respiratory health effects and short-term exposure to 
SO2 (U.S. EPA, 2008).  The immediate effect of SO2 on the respiratory system in humans is 
bronchoconstriction.  Asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of SO2 likely resulting 
from preexisting inflammation associated with this disease.  A clear concentration-response 
relationship has been demonstrated in laboratory studies following exposures to SO2 at 
concentrations between 20 and 100 ppb, both in terms of increasing severity of effect and 
percentage of asthmatics adversely affected. Based on our review of this information, we 
identified four short-term morbidity endpoints that the SO2 ISA identified as a “causal 
relationship”: asthma exacerbation, respiratory-related emergency department visits, and 
respiratory-related hospitalizations.  The differing evidence and associated strength of the 
evidence for these different effects is described in detail in the SO2 ISA.  The SO2 ISA also 
concluded that the relationship between short-term SO2 exposure and premature mortality 
was “suggestive of a causal relationship” because it is difficult to attribute the mortality risk 
effects to SO2 alone.  Although the SO2 ISA stated that studies are generally consistent in 
reporting a relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, there was a lack of robustness 
of the observed associations to adjustment for pollutants.  We did not quantify these benefits 
due to time constraints. 
Epidemiological researchers have associated NO2 exposure with adverse health 
effects in numerous toxicological, clinical and epidemiological studies, as described in the 
Integrated Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen - Health Criteria (Final Report) (U.S. 
  
 
 
173
EPA, 2008c).  The NO2 ISA provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence of 
health and environmental effects of NO2.  The NO2 ISA concluded that the evidence “is 
sufficient to infer a likely causal relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and adverse 
effects on the respiratory system” (ISA, section 5.3.2.1).  These epidemiologic and 
experimental studies encompass a number of endpoints including [Emergency Department 
(ED)] visits and hospitalizations, respiratory symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness, airway 
inflammation, and lung function.  Effect estimates from epidemiologic studies conducted in 
the United States and Canada generally indicate a 2-20% increase in risks for ED visits and 
hospital admissions and higher risks for respiratory symptoms (ISA, section 5.4).  The NO2 
ISA concluded that the relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and premature 
mortality was “suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship” because it is 
difficult to attribute the mortality risk effects to NO2 alone.  Although the NO2 ISA stated 
that studies consistently reported a relationship between NO2 exposure and mortality, the 
effect was generally smaller than that for other pollutants such as PM.  We did not quantify 
these benefits due to time constraints. 
 
 
5.6 Social Cost of Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Benefits 
 
EPA has assigned a dollar value to reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
using recent estimates of the “social cost of carbon” (SCC).  The SCC is an estimate of the 
monetized damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon emissions in a given 
year.  It is intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net agricultural productivity, 
human health, property damages from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem 
services due to climate change.  The SCC estimates used in this analysis were developed 
through an interagency process that included EPA and other executive branch entities, and 
concluded in February 2010.  EPA first used these SCC estimates in the benefits analysis for 
the final joint EPA/DOT Rulemaking to establish Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards; see the rule’s 
preamble for discussion about application of SCC (75 FR 25324; 5/7/10).  The SCC 
Technical Support Document (SCC TSD) provides a complete discussion of the methods 
  
 
 
174
used to develop these SCC estimates.47   
The interagency group selected four SCC values for use in regulatory analyses, which 
we have applied in this analysis: $5, $21, $35, and $65 per metric ton of CO2 emissions48 in 
2010, in 2007 dollars.  The first three values are based on the average SCC from three 
integrated assessment models, at discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent, respectively.  SCCs 
at several discount rates are included because the literature shows that the SCC is quite 
sensitive to assumptions about the discount rate, and because no consensus exists on the 
appropriate rate to use in an intergenerational context. The fourth value is the 95th percentile 
of the SCC from all three models at a 3 percent discount rate.  It is included to represent 
higher-than-expected impacts from temperature change further out in the tails of the SCC 
distribution. Low probability, high impact events are incorporated into all of the SCC values 
through explicit consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of 
a probability density function for equilibrium climate sensitivity.  Treating climate sensitivity 
probabilistically results in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher 
projections of damages. 
The SCC increases over time because future emissions are expected to produce larger 
incremental damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to 
greater climatic change.  Note that the interagency group estimated the growth rate of the 
SCC directly using the three integrated assessment models rather than assuming a constant 
annual growth rate. This helps to ensure that the estimates are internally consistent with other 
modeling assumptions.   The SCC estimates for the analysis years of 2014, in 2006 dollars 
are provided in Table 5-15.

48 The interagency group decided that these estimates apply only to CO2 emissions.  Given that warming 
profiles and impacts other than temperature change (e.g. ocean acidification) vary across GHGs, the group 
concluded “transforming gases into CO2-equivalents using GWP, and then multiplying the carbon-equivalents 
by the SCC, would not result in accurate estimates of the social costs of non-CO2 gases” (SCC TSD, pg 13).

When attempting to assess the incremental economic impacts of carbon dioxide 
emissions, the analyst faces a number of serious challenges.  A recent report from the 
National Academies of Science (NRC 2009) points out that any assessment will suffer from 
uncertainty, speculation, and lack of information about (1) future emissions of greenhouse 
gases, (2) the effects of past and future emissions on the climate system, (3) the impact of 
changes in climate on the physical and biological environment, and (4) the translation of 
these environmental impacts into economic damages.  As a result, any effort to quantify and 
monetize the harms associated with climate change will raise serious questions of science, 
economics, and ethics and should be viewed as provisional.   
The interagency group noted a number of limitations to the SCC analysis, including 
the incomplete way in which the integrated assessment models capture catastrophic and non-
catastrophic impacts, their incomplete treatment of adaptation and technological change, 
uncertainty in the extrapolation of damages to high temperatures, and assumptions regarding 
risk aversion.  The limited amount of research linking climate impacts to economic damages 
makes the interagency modeling exercise even more difficult.  The interagency group hopes 
that over time researchers and modelers will work to fill these gaps and that the SCC 
estimates used for regulatory analysis by the Federal government will continue to evolve 
with improvements in modeling. Additional details on these limitations are discussed in the 
SCC TSD. 
In light of these limitations, the interagency group has committed to updating the 
current estimates as the science and economic understanding of climate change and its 
impacts on society improves over time.  Specifically, the interagency group has set a 
preliminary goal of revisiting the SCC values within two years or at such time as 
substantially updated models become available, and to continue to support research in this 
area.  
Applying the global SCC estimates to the estimated reductions in CO2 emissions for 
the range of policy scenarios, we estimate the dollar value of the climate related benefits 
captured by the models for each analysis year.  For internal consistency, the annual benefits 
are discounted back to NPV terms using the same discount rate as each SCC estimate (i.e.

5%, 3%, and 2.5%) rather than 3% and 7%.49 These estimates are provided in Table 5-16.

5.7 Benefits Results 
 Applying the impact and valuation functions described previously in this chapter to 
the estimated changes in ozone and PM yields estimates of the changes in physical damages 
(e.g., premature mortalities, cases, admissions, and change in light extinction) and the 
associated monetary values for those changes.  Estimates of physical health impacts among 
those states in either the ozone or PM2.5 trading region, or outside the trading region, are 
presented in Table 5-15.  Monetized values for both health and welfare endpoints within the 
trading region are presented in Table 5-16, along with total aggregate monetized benefits. All 
of the monetary benefits are in constant-year 2006 dollars. The PM2.5-related benefits of the 
Direct Control and Intrastate Trading scenarios were within about 5% of the preferred 
                                                 
49 It is possible that other benefits or costs of proposed regulations unrelated to CO2 emissions will be 
discounted at rates that differ from those used to develop the SCC estimates.

  Not all known PM- and ozone-related health and welfare effects could be quantified or 
monetized.  The monetized value of these unquantified effects is represented by adding an 
unknown “B” to the aggregate total.  The estimate of total monetized health benefits is thus 
equal to the subset of monetized PM- and ozone-related health and welfare benefits plus B, 
the sum of the nonmonetized health and welfare benefits; this B represents both uncertainty 
and a bias in this analysis, as it reflects those benefits categories that we are unable quantify 
in this analysis.  
 Total monetized benefits are dominated by benefits of mortality risk reductions.  The 
primary analysis projects that the proposed remedy will result in between 14,000 and 36,000 
PM2.5 and ozone-related avoided premature deaths annually in 2014. Our estimate of total 
monetized benefits in 2014 proposed remedy is between $120 billion and $290 billion using 
a 3 percent discount rate and between $110 billion and $270 using a 7 percent discount rate.  
Health benefits account for between 97 and 99 percent of total benefits depending on the 
PM2.5 and ozone mortality estimates used, in part because we are unable to quantify most of 
the non-health benefits.  The monetized benefit associated with reductions in the risk of 
premature mortality, which accounts for between $110 and $280 billion in 2014, depending 
again on the PM and ozone mortality risk estimates used, is between 90 and 96 percent of 
  
 
 
182
total monetized health benefits.  The next largest benefit is for reductions in chronic illness 
(CB and nonfatal heart attacks), although this value is more than an order of magnitude lower 
than for premature mortality.  Hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular causes, 
visibility, MRADs, work loss days, school absence days, and worker productivity account for 
the majority of the remaining benefits.  The remaining categories each account for a small 
percentage of total benefit; however, they represent a large number of avoided incidences 
affecting many individuals.  A comparison of the incidence table to the monetary benefits 
table reveals that there is not always a close correspondence between the number of 
incidences avoided for a given endpoint and the monetary value associated with that 
endpoint.  For example, there are almost 100 times more work loss days than premature 
mortalities, yet work loss days account for only a very small fraction of total monetized 
benefits.  This reflects the fact that many of the less severe health effects, while more 
common, are valued at a lower level than the more severe health effects.  Also, some effects, 
such as hospital admissions, are valued using a proxy measure of WTP.  As such, the true 
value of these effects may be higher than that reported in Table 5-16.  
Figures 5-15 and 5-16 illustrates the geographic distribution of avoided PM2.5 and 
ozone-related mortalities estimated to result from the proposed remedy. Figure 5-17 plots the 
cumulative distribution of reductions in all-cause premature mortality attributable to 
reductions in PM2.5 and ozone resulting from the proposed remedy. Among the 10 counties 
containing the most populous cities in the U.S., the three experiencing the largest reduction 
in the percentage of PM2.5 and ozone-related premature mortality are located within the 
Transport Rule region: New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. While not quantified in this 
RIA, we expect the Transport Rule to produce important public health benefits for 
populations living in Canada. Approximately 90% of the Canadian population lives within 
100 miles of the U.S. border, suggesting that some of the air quality improvements projected 
in areas near the U.S.-Canada border would be enjoyed by Canadian populations as well. A 
recent analysis (Chestnut and Mills, 2005) of the U.S. Acid Rain Program estimates annual 
benefits of the program in 2010 to both Canada and the United States at $122 billion and 
costs for that year at $3 billion (2000$)—a 40-to-1 benefit/cost ratio. These quantified 
benefits in the United States and Canada are the result of improved air quality prolonging 
lives, reducing heart attacks and other cardiovascular and respiratory problems, and 
  
 
 
183
improving visibility. The complete report is available in volume 77, issue 3, of the Journal of 
Environmental Management. 
These figures show that while there are very large health benefits throughout most of 
the East, there could be several areas where a very small disbenefit could result if further 
governmental actions do not occur to address them in the future. There are several upcoming 
planned federal actions that could lead to further large reductions throughout the US of 
ambient levels of fine particles and ozone.  Additionally, state actions to address regional 
haze in the near future and the existing NAAQS for fine particles and ozone could address 
these situations.  There are also other state actions, such as the recent Colorado Clean Air – 
Clean Jobs Act of April 2010 that is likely to convert much of the front range coal-fired 
generation in Colorado to natural gas in the near future.

A Bell et al. 2005 ozone mortality estimate and Pope et al. 2002 PM2.5 mortality estimates. 
 
Figure 5-18 summarizes an array of PM2.5-related monetized benefits estimates based 
on alternative epidemiology and expert-derived PM-mortality estimate as well as the sum of 
ozone-related benefits using the Bell et al. (2004) mortality estimate.  
Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA estimated PM-
related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which was recently reviewed 
by EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-
linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship 
  
 
 
187
while recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-response 
function. Consistent with this finding, we have conformed the threshold sensitivity analysis 
to the current state of the PM science improved upon our previous approach for estimating 
the sensitivity of the benefits estimates to the presence of an assumed threshold by 
incorporating a new “Lowest Measured Level” (LML) assessment. 
This approach summarizes the distribution of avoided PM mortality impacts 
according to the baseline (i.e. pre-Transport Rule) PM2.5 levels experienced by the 
population receiving the PM2.5 mortality benefit (Figure 5-19). We identify on this figure the 
lowest air quality levels measured in each of the two primary epidemiological studies EPA 
uses to quantify PM-related mortality. This information allows readers to determine the 
portion of PM-related mortality benefits occurring above or below the LML of each study; in 
general, our confidence in the estimated PM mortality decreases as we consider air quality 
levels further below the LML in the two epidemiological studies. While the LML analysis 
provides some insight into the level of uncertainty in the estimated PM mortality benefits, 
EPA does not view the LML as a threshold and continues to quantify PM-related mortality 
impacts using a full range of modeled air quality concentrations. 
The very large proportion of the avoided PM-related impacts we estimate in this 
analysis occur among populations exposed at or above the LML of each study (Figures 5-20 
and 5-21), increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Approximately 80% of 
the avoided impacts occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m3 (the LML of 
the Laden et al. 2006 study); about 97% occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 
µg/m3 (the LML of the Pope et al. 2002 study). As we model mortality impacts among 
populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of each 
study our confidence in the results diminishes. However, the analysis above confirms that the 
great majority of the impacts occur at or above each study’s LML. 
As an example, when considering mortality impacts among populations living in 
areas with an annual mean PM level of 8 ug/m3, we would place greater confidence in 
estimates drawn from the Pope et al. 2002 study, as this air quality level is above the LML of 
this study. Conversely, we would place equal confidence when estimating mortality impacts 
among populations living in locations where the annual mean PM levels are above 10 ug/m3 
because this value is at or above the LML of each study.  
  
 
 
188
Finally, Figure 5-22 illustrates the percentage of population exposed to different 
levels of annual mean PM2.5 levels in the baseline and after the implementation of the 
Transport Rule in 2014. The Transport Rule reduces overall PM2.5 levels substantially, 
particularly among highly exposed populations located within the states covered by the rule. 
Locations of the U.S. where annual mean PM levels are below the lowest measured level of 
the Pope study--western states in particular--are generally unaffected by the rule. However, 
for populations in the far western portion of the Transport Rule region, where annual mean 
PM2.5 concentrations are below 7.5 ug/m3, there are benefits of the rule, although the 
relative magnitude of those benefits compared to benefits in the majority of the areas covered 
by the Transport Rule is small.  In these areas there is lower confidence in the magnitude of 
the benefits associated with reductions in long-term PM2.5.   In addition, we note that prior 
to the implementation of the Transport Rule, 89% of the population live in areas where 
PM2.5 levels are projected to be above the lowest measured levels of the Pope study. Taken 
together, this information increases our confidence in the estimated mortality reductions for 
this rule. 
While the LML of each study is important to consider when characterizing and 
interpreting the overall level PM-related benefits, as discussed earlier in this chapter, EPA 
believes that both cohort-based mortality estimates are suitable for use in air pollution health 
impact analyses. When estimating PM mortality impacts using risk coefficients drawn from 
the Laden et al. analysis of the Harvard Six Cities and the Pope et al. analysis of the 
American Cancer Society cohorts there are innumerable other attributes that may affect the 
size of the reported risk estimates—including differences in population demographics, the 
size of the cohort, activity patterns and particle composition among others. The LML 
assessment presented here provides a limited representation of one key difference between 
the two studies.

5.8 Discussion 
This analysis demonstrates the significant health and welfare benefits of the 
Transport Rule. We estimate that by 2014 the rule will have reduced the number of PM2.5 and 
ozone-related premature mortalities by between 14,000 and 36,000, produce substantial non-
mortality benefits and significantly improve visibility in Class 1 areas. This rule promises to 
yield significant welfare impacts as well, though the quantification of those endpoints in this 
RIA is incomplete.  These significant health and welfare benefits suggest the important role 
that pollution from the EGU sector plays in the public health impacts of air pollution.  
Inherent in any complex RIA such as this one are multiple sources of uncertainty. 
Some of these we characterized through our quantification of statistical error in the 
concentration response relationships and our use of the expert elicitation-derived PM 
mortality functions. Others, including the projection of atmospheric conditions and source-
level emissions, the projection of baseline morbidity rates, incomes and technological 
  
 
 
194
development are unquantified. When evaluated within the context of these uncertainties, the 
health impact and monetized benefits estimates in this RIA can provide useful information 
regarding the public health impacts attributable to EGUs.

CHAPTER 6 
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROFILE 
 
This chapter discusses important aspects of the power sector that relate to the 
Transport Rule, including the types of power-sector sources affected by the Transport Rule, 
and provides background on the power sector and electric generating units (EGUs).  In 
addition, this chapter provides some historical background on EPA regulation of and future 
projections for the power sector. 
 
6.1 Power Sector Overview 
 The production and delivery of electricity to customers consists of three distinct 
segments: generation, transmission, and distribution. 
6.1.1 Generation 
 Electricity generation is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers.  
Most of the capacity for generating electricity involves creating heat to rotate turbines which, 
in turn, create electricity.  The power sector consists of over 17,000 generating units, 
comprising fossil-fuel-fired units, nuclear units, and hydroelectric and other renewable 
sources dispersed throughout the country (see Table 6-1).

These electric generating sources provide electricity for commercial, industrial, and 
residential uses, each of which consumes roughly a quarter to a third of the total electricity 
produced (see Table 6-2).  Some of these uses are highly variable, such as heating and air 
conditioning in residential and commercial buildings, while others are relatively constant, 
such as industrial processes that operate 24 hours a day.

In 2008, electric generating sources produced 4,157 billion kWh to meet electricity 
demand.  Roughly 70 percent of this electricity was produced through the combustion of 
fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, with coal accounting for approximately half of the 
total (see Table 6-3).

Note: Retail sales and net generation are not equal because net generation includes 
net exported electricity and loss of electricity that occurs through transmission and 
distribution. 
 
Coal-fired generating units typically supply “base-load” electricity, the portion of 
electricity loads which are continually present, and typically operate throughout the day.  
Along with nuclear generation, these coal units meet the part of demand that is relatively 
constant.  Gas-fired generation, on the other hand, is more often used to meet the variable 
portion of the electricity load and typically supplies “peak” power, when there is increased 
demand for electricity (for example, when businesses operate throughout the day or when 
people return home from work and run appliances and heating/air-conditioning), versus late 
at night or very early morning, when demand for electricity is reduced. 
 
  
 
 
222
6.1.2 Transmission 
Transmission is the term used to describe the movement of electricity over a network 
of high voltage lines, from electric generators to substations where power is stepped down 
for local distribution.  In the US and Canada, there are three separate interconnected 
networks of high voltage transmission lines50, each operating at a common frequency.  
Within each of these transmission networks, there are multiple areas where the operation of 
power plants is monitored and controlled to ensure that electricity generation and load are 
kept in balance.  In some areas, the operation of the transmission system is under the control 
of a single regional operator; in others, individual utilities coordinate the operations of their 
generation, transmission, and distribution systems to balance their common generation and 
load needs. 
6.1.3 Distribution 
Distribution of electricity involves networks of lower voltage lines and substations 
that take the higher voltage power from the transmission system and step it down to lower 
voltage levels to match the needs of customers.  The transmission and distribution system is 
the classic example of a natural monopoly, in part because it is not practical to have more 
than one set of lines running from the electricity generating sources to substations or from 
substations to residences and business, and in part because both transmission and generation 
are characterized by very high capital costs and very low variable operating costs. 
Transmission has generally been developed by the larger vertically integrated utilities 
that typically operate generation and distribution networks.  Distribution is handled by a 
large number of utilities that often purchase and sell electricity, but do not generate it.  
Transmission and distribution have been considered differently from generation in efforts to 
restructure the industry.  As discussed below, electricity restructuring has focused primarily 
on efforts to reorganize the industry to encourage competition in the generation segment of 
the industry, including ensuring open access of generation to the transmission and 
distribution services needed to deliver power to consumers.  In many state efforts, this has 
also included separating generation assets from transmission and distribution assets into 
                                                 
50 These three network interconnections are the western US and Canada, corresponding approximately to the 
area west of the Rocky Mountains; eastern US and Canada, not including most of Texas; and a third network 
operating in most of Texas. 
  
 
 
223
separate economic entities.  Transmission and distribution remain price-regulated throughout 
the country based on the cost of service. 
 
6.2 Deregulation and Restructuring 
 The process of restructuring and deregulation of wholesale and retail electric markets 
has changed the structure of the electric power industry.  In addition to reorganizing asset 
management between companies, restructuring sought a functional unbundling of the 
generation, transmission, distribution, and ancillary services the power sector has historically 
provided, with the aim of enhancing competition in the generation segment of the industry. 
Beginning in the 1970s, government policy shifted against traditional regulatory 
approaches and in favor of deregulation for many important industries, including 
transportation (notably commercial airlines), communications, and energy, which were all 
thought to be natural monopolies (prior to 1970) that warranted governmental control of 
pricing.  However, deregulation efforts in the power sector were most active during the 
1990s.  Some of the primary drivers for deregulation of electric power included the desire for 
more efficient investment choices, the possibility of lower electric rates, reduced costs of 
combustion turbine technology that opened the door for more companies to sell power, and 
complexity of monitoring utilities’ cost of service and establishing cost-based rates for 
various customer classes (see Figure 6-1). 
The pace of restructuring in the electric power industry slowed significantly in 
response to market volatility and financial turmoil associated with bankruptcy filings of key 
energy companies in California.  By the end of 2001, restructuring had either been delayed or 
suspended in eight states that previously enacted legislation or issued regulatory orders for its 
implementation (shown as “Suspended” in Figure 6-1 below).  Another 18 other states that 
had seriously explored the possibility of deregulation in 2000 reported no legislative or 
regulatory activity in 2001 (DOE, EIA, 2003a) (“Not Active” in Figure 6-1 below).  
Currently, there are 15 states where price deregulation of generation (restructuring) has 
occurred (“Active” in Figure 6-1 below).  Thirteen of these states are in the Transport Rule 
region.  The effort is more or less at a standstill; there have been no recent proposals to the 
  
 
 
224
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for actions aimed at wider restructuring, 
and no new states have begun retail deregulation activity.

6.3 Pollution and EPA Regulation of Emissions 
 The burning of fossil fuels, which generates about 70 percent of our electricity 
nationwide, results in air emissions of SO2 and NOx, important precursors in the formation of 
fine particles and ozone (NOx only).  The power sector is a major contributor of both these 
pollutants, and reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions are critical to EPA’s efforts to bring 
about attainment with the fine particle and ozone NAAQS through programs like the 
Transport Rule.  In 2008, the power sector accounted for 66 percent of total nationwide SO2 
emissions and 18 percent of total nationwide NOx emissions (see Figure 6-2). 
 
  
 
 
225
Figure 6-2.  Emissions of SO2 and NOx from the Power Sector (2008) 
 
Source: EPA http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/trends/ 
Different types of fossil fuel-fired units vary widely in their air emissions levels for 
SO2 and NOx, particularly when uncontrolled.  For coal-fired units, NOx emissions rates can 
vary from under 0.05 lbs/mmBtu (for a unit with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx 
removal) to over 1 lb/mmBtu for an uncontrolled cyclone boiler.  NOx emissions from 
coal-fired power plants are formed during combustion and are a result of both nitrogen in 
coal and nitrogen in the air.  SO2 emissions rates can vary from under 0.1 lbs/mmBtu (for 
some units with flue gas desulfurization (FGD) for SO2 removal) to over 5 lbs/mmBtu for 
units burning higher sulfur coal without any pollution controls.  For an uncontrolled coal 
plant, SO2 emissions are directly related to the amount of sulfur in the coal. 
Oil- and gas-fired units also have a wide range of NOx emissions depending on both 
the plant type and the controls installed.  Gas-fired units with SCR can have emissions rates 
under 0.01 lbs/mmBtu, while completely uncontrolled units can have emissions rates in 
excess of 0.5 lbs/mmBtu.  Gas-fired units have very little SO2 emissions.  NOx emissions 
rates on oil-fired units can range from under 0.1 lbs/mmBtu (for units with new combustion 
controls) to over 0.6 lbs/mmBtu for units without combustion controls.  SO2 emissions for 
oil-fired units can range from under 0.1 lbs/mmBtu for units burning low sulfur distillate oil

226
to over 2 lbs/mmBtu for units burning high sulfur residual oil. 
 
6.4 Pollution Control Technologies 
 There are three options for reducing SO2 emissions from coal-burning power plants.  
Units may switch from higher to lower sulfur coal, blend higher sulfur coal with lower sulfur 
coal, or use FGD, commonly referred to as scrubbers.  According to data submitted to EPA 
for compliance with the Title IV Acid Rain Program, the SO2 emissions rates for coal-fired 
units without controls varied from under 0.4 lbs/mmBtu to over 5 lbs/mmBtu depending on 
the type of coal combusted.  With controls, rates range from as low as 0.03 lbs/mmBtu to 
close to 1 lb/mmBtu. 
It is generally easier to switch to a coal within the same rank (e.g., bituminous or 
sub-bituminous) because these coals will have similar heat contents and other characteristics. 
 Switching completely to sub-bituminous coal (which typically has lower sulfur content) 
from bituminous coal is likely to require some modifications to the unit.  Limited blending of 
sub-bituminous coal with bituminous coal can often be done with fewer modifications.   
The two most commonly used scrubber types include wet scrubbers and spray dryers, 
also known as dry scrubbers.  Wet scrubbers can use a variety of sorbents to capture SO2, 
including limestone and magnesium-enhanced lime.  The choice of sorbent can affect the 
performance, size, and capital and operating costs of the scrubber.  New wet scrubbers 
typically achieve at least 95 percent SO2 removal.  Spray dryers use lime-based slurry and 
can achieve over 90 percent removal. 
One method of reducing NOx emissions is through the use of combustion controls 
(such as low NOx burners and over-fire air).  Combustion controls adjust the coal combustion 
conditions to those where less formation of NOx occurs.  Post-combustion controls remove 
the NOx after it has been formed.  The most common post-combustion control is SCR.  In 
SCR systems ammonia (NH3) is injected, which combines with the NOx in the flue gas, to 
form nitrogen and water and uses a catalyst to enhance the reaction.  These systems can 
reduce NOx by 90 percent and achieve emissions rates of around 0.06 lbs/mmBtu.  Another 
post-combustion control is Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).  In this technology 
  
 
 
227
NOx also is removed by injecting ammonia, but no catalyst is used.  SNCR systems can 
reduce NOx by up to 40 percent. 
Some of the same control options available to coal-fired units are also applicable to 
units fueled by oil or gas.  Combustion controls, SCR, and SNCR can also be applied to oil- 
and gas-fired boilers for NOx control.  Combustion controls and SCR are also routinely used 
for NOx control on gas turbines. 
For more detail on the cost and performance assumptions of pollution controls, see 
the documentation for the Integrated Planning Model (IPM), a dynamic linear programming 
model that EPA uses to examine air pollution control policies for SO2 and NOx throughout 
the contiguous United States for the entire power system.  Documentation for IPM can be 
found at www.epa.gov/airmarkets/epa-ipm and in the TSD “Updates to EPA Base Case 
v3.02 EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model.” 
 
6.5 Regulation of the Power Sector 
 At the federal level, efforts to reduce emissions of SO2 have been occurring since 
1970.  Policy makers have recognized the need to address these harmful emissions, and 
incremental steps have been taken to ensure that the country meets air quality standards.  The 
Transport Rule is the next step towards realizing attainment of the national standards for 
PM2.5 and ozone. 
 Even before widespread regulation of SO2 and NOx for the power sector, total 
suspended particulate matter (TSP) was a related target of state and federal action.  Because 
larger particulates are visible as dark smoke from smokestacks, most states had regulations 
by 1970 limiting the opacity of emissions.  Requirements for taller smokestacks also 
mitigated local impacts of TSP.  Notably, such regulations effectively addressed large-
diameter, filterable particulate matter rather than condensable particulate matter (such as 
PM2.5) associated with SO2 and NOx emissions, which are not visible at the smokestack and 
have impacts far from their sources. 
  
 
 
228
Federal regulation of SO2 and NOx emissions at power plants began with the 1970 
Clean Air Act.  The Act required the Agency to develop New Source Performance Standards 
(NSPS) for a number of source categories including coal-fired power plants.  The first NSPS 
for power plants (subpart D) required new units to limit SO2 emissions either by using 
scrubbers or by using low sulfur coal.  NOx was required to be limited through the use of low 
NOx burners.  A new NSPS (subpart Da), promulgated in 1978, tightened the standards for 
SO2, requiring scrubbers on all new units. 
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) placed a number of new requirements 
on power plants.  The Acid Rain Program, established under Title IV of the 1990 CAAA, 
requires major reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions.  The SO2 program sets a permanent cap 
on the total amount of SO2 that can be emitted by electric power plants in the contiguous 
United States at about one-half of the amount of SO2 these sources emitted in 1980.  Using a 
market-based cap and trade mechanism allows flexibility for individual combustion units to 
select their own methods of compliance with the SO2 reduction requirements.  The program 
uses a more traditional approach to NOx emissions limitations for certain coal-fired electric 
utility boilers, with the objective of achieving a 2 million ton reduction from projected NOx 
emission levels that would have been emitted in 2000 without implementation of Title IV. 
The Acid Rain Program comprises two phases for SO2 and NOx.  Phase I applied 
primarily to the largest coal-fired electric generating sources from 1995 through 1999 for 
SO2 and from 1996 through 1999 for NOx.  Phase II for both pollutants began in 2000.  For 
SO2, it applies to thousands of combustion units generating electricity nationwide; for NOx it 
generally applies to affected units that burned coal during 1990 through 1995.  The Acid 
Rain Program has led to the installation of a number of scrubbers on existing coal-fired units 
as well as significant fuel switching to lower sulfur coals.  Under the NOx provisions of Title 
IV, most existing coal-fired units installed low NOx burners.
The CAAA also placed much greater emphasis on control of NOx to reduce ozone 
nonattainment.  This led to the formation of several regional NOx trading programs as well as 
intrastate NOx trading programs in states such as Texas.  The northeastern states of the 
Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) required existing sources to meet Reasonably 
Available Control Technology (RACT) limits on NOx in 1995 and in 1999 began an ozone-
  
 
 
 
 
229 
season cap and trade program to achieve deeper reductions.  In 1998, EPA promulgated 
regulations (the NOx SIP Call) that required 21 states in the eastern United States and the 
District of Columbia to reduce NOx emissions that contributed to nonattainment in 
downwind states using the cap and trade approach.  This program began in May of 2003 and 
has resulted in the installation of significant amounts of selective catalytic reduction. 
The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) built on EPA’s efforts in the NOx SIP call to 
address specifically interstate pollution transport for ozone, and was EPA’s first attempt to 
address interstate pollution transport for PM2.5.  It required significant reductions in 
emissions of SO2 and NOx in 28 states and the District of Columbia (see Figure 6-3 below).  
EGUs were found to be a major source of the SO2 and NOx emissions which contributed to 
fine particle concentrations and ozone problems downwind.  Although the D.C. Circuit 
remanded the rule to EPA in 2008, it did so without vacatur, allowing the rule to remain in 
effect while EPA addresses the remand.  Thus, CAIR is continuing to help states address 
ozone and PM2.5 nonattainment and improve visibility by reducing transported precursors of 
SO2 and NOx through the implementation of three separate cap and trade compliance 
programs for annual NOx, ozone season NOx, and annual SO2 emissions from power plants.

Figure 6-3.  States Covered under the Clean Air Interstate Rule 
 
 
Perhaps in anticipation of complying with CAIR, especially the more stringent 
second phase that was set to begin in 2015, several sources have recently been installing or 
planning to install advanced controls for SO2 and NOx to begin operating in the 2010 to 2015 
timeframe.  Many EPA New Source Review (NSR) settlements also require controls in those 
years, as do state rules in Georgia, Illinois, and Maryland.  States like North Carolina, New 
York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Delaware have also moved to control these emissions 
to address nonattainment.  Thus both federal and state efforts are continuing to bring about 
sizeable reductions in SO2 and NOx from the power sector.  Section 7-1 below discusses how 
these recent activities are reflected in the Transport Rule base case.  Details of the NSR 
settlements and state controls can be found in the IPM documentation referenced earlier.

6.6 Price Elasticity of Electricity 
 Electricity performs a vital and high-value function in the economy; as a result, 
electricity consumers are generally unable or unwilling to alter consumption as the price 
increases.  Demand for electricity, especially in the short run, is not very sensitive to changes 
in prices and is considered relatively price inelastic, although some demand reduction does 
occur.  With that in mind, EPA modeling does not incorporate a “demand response” in its 
electric generation modeling (Chapter 7) to any increases in electricity prices because of the 
reasons mentioned.  Electricity demand is considered to be constant in EPA modeling 
applications and the reduction in production costs that would result from lower demand is not 
considered.  This leads to some overstatement in the private compliance costs that EPA 
estimates.  Notably, the “compliance costs” are the changes in the electric power generation 
costs in the base case and pollution control options that are evaluated in Chapter 7.  In simple 
terms, it is the resource costs of what the power industry will directly expend to comply with 
EPA’s requirements.  This is not the “social cost” of the rule which has been separately 
explained and estimated in EMPAX modeling in Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 7 
COST, ECONOMIC, AND ENERGY IMPACTS 
 
This chapter reports the cost, economic, and energy impact analysis performed for the 
Transport Rule.  EPA used the Integrated Planning Model (IPM), developed by ICF 
Consulting, to conduct its analysis.  IPM is a dynamic linear programming model that can be 
used to examine air pollution control policies for SO2 and NOx (as well as other air 
pollutants) throughout the contiguous United States for the entire power system.  
Documentation for IPM can be found at http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm, 
and updates specific to Transport Rule modeling are in the TSD “Updates to EPA Base Case 
v3.02 EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model.” 
 
7.1 Background 
Over the last decade, EPA has on several occasions used IPM to consider control 
options for reducing power-sector SO2 and NOx for regional transport.  These, along with the 
alternative remedies analyzed alongside the proposed remedy below, both provide context 
and suggest alternative approaches to the Transport Rule proposed remedy (see Keohane 
2009, 34–35 and Wagner 2009, 59). 
Many EPA analyses with IPM have focused on legislative changes with national 
programs, such as EPA’s IPM analyses of the Clean Air Planning Act (S.843 in 108th 
Congress), the Clean Power Act (S.150 in 109th Congress), the Clear Skies Act of 2005 
(S.131 in 109th Congress), the Clear Skies Act of 2003 (S.485 in 108th Congress), and the 
Clear Skies Manager's Mark (of S.131).  These analyses are available at EPA’s website: 
(www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/cair/multi.html).  EPA’s IPM analysis for CAIR is 
another example, in this case dealing with a regulatory approach focusing on the eastern US: 
(www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm/cair/index.html). 
In addition, EPA conducted extensive state-by-state analysis of control levels and 
associated emissions projections related to identifying significant contribution to 
  
 
 
 
 
233 
nonattainment and interference with maintenance for the Transport Rule.  More details on 
this analysis can be found in the Significant Contribution Approach TSD. 
As discussed in section 6.5, this proposed rule comes during a period when many new 
SO2 and NOx controls are being installed.  Many are needed for compliance with NSR 
settlements and state rules, while others may have been planned in expectation of CAIR.  
Because CAIR remains in effect until it is replaced, emission reductions continue in the 
eastern US. 
The base case in this RIA assumes that CAIR is not in effect, but does take into 
account emissions reductions associated with the implementation of all federal rules, state 
rules and statutes, and other binding, enforceable commitments finalized by February 3, 
2009, that the power industry has for installing and operating SO2 and NOx emissions 
controls in the timeframe covered in the analysis. 
EPA has made these base case assumptions recognizing that a key step in the process 
of developing a 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) rule, such as the Transport Rule, involves analyzing 
existing (base case) emissions to determine which states significantly contribute to 
downwind nonattainment and maintenance areas.  EPA cannot prejudge at this stage which 
states will be affected by the rule.  For example, a state affected by CAIR may not be 
affected by the new rule and after the new rule goes into effect, the CAIR requirements will 
no longer apply.  For a state covered by CAIR but not covered by the new rule, the CAIR 
requirements would not be replaced with new requirements, and therefore an increase in 
emissions relative to present levels could occur in that state.  More fundamentally, the court 
has made clear that, due to legal flaws, the CAIR rule cannot remain in place and must be 
replaced.  If EPA’s base case analysis were to ignore this fact and assume that reductions 
from CAIR would continue indefinitely, areas that are in attainment solely due to controls 
required by CAIR would again face nonattainment problems, because the existing protection 
from upwind pollution would not be replaced.  For these reasons, EPA cannot assume in its 
base case analysis that the reductions required by CAIR will continue to be achieved. 
Following this logic, the 2012 base case shows emissions higher than current levels in 
some states.  Because EPA has been directed to replace CAIR, EPA believes that for many 
  
 
 
 
 
234 
states, the absence of the CAIR NOx program will lead to reversion to the NOx Budget 
Trading Program (NBP), which substantially limits ozone-season NOx emissions from 
electric power generation in a major part of the Eastern US and ensures the operation of NOx 
controls in 20 covered states and the District of Columbia.  The base case contains the NBP.  
Also, without the CAIR SO2 program, there would remain the broad federal SO2 emissions 
requirements for electric generation from fossil fuels in the lower 48 states for the 
comparatively less stringent CAA Title IV Acid Rain program.  As a result, SO2 emissions in 
many states would increase markedly in the 2012 base case relative to the present.  Efforts to 
comply with ARP rules at the least-cost would occur in many cases solely through use of 
currently readily available, inexpensive Title IV allowances and without the operation of 
some existing scrubbers that do not have other binding enforceable requirements.  Notably, 
all known controls for both SO2 and NOx that are required under state laws, NSPS, consent 
decrees, and other enforceable, binding commitments through 2014 are accounted for in the 
base case. These requirements are quite substantial in maintaining the operation of much of 
the existing advanced controls in place.  It is against this backdrop that the Transport Rule is 
analyzed and that significant contribution to nonattainment and interference with 
maintenance must be addressed. 
The model’s base case features an updated Title IV SO2 allowance bank assumption 
and incorporates updates related to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  
Many key assumptions, notably demand for electricity, reflect the 2008 Annual Energy 
Outlook from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).51  In addition, the model 
includes policies affecting the power sector: the Title IV of the Clean Air Act (the Acid Rain 
Program); the NOx SIP Call; various New Source Review (NSR) settlements52; and several 
                                                 
51 For the final rule, EPA anticipates using an updated version of IPM that will reflect assumptions from AEO 
2010. 
52 The NSR settlements include agreements between EPA and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company 
(Vectren), Public Service Enterprise Group, Tampa Electric Company, We Energies (WEPCO), Virginia 
Electric & Power Company (Dominion), Santee Cooper, Minnkota Power Coop, American Electric Power 
(AEP), East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC), Nevada Power Company, Illinois Power, Mirant, Ohio 
Edison, and Kentucky Utilities. These agreements lay out specific NOx, SO2, and other emissions controls for 
the fleets of these major Eastern companies by specified dates. Many of the pollution controls (e.g FGDs and 
SCRs) are required between 2010 and 2014. 
  
 
 
 
 
235 
state rules53 affecting emissions of SO2 and NOx that were finalized through February 3, 
2009.  IPM includes state rules that have been finalized and/or approved by a state’s 
legislature or environmental agency.  The IPM documentation TSD contains details on all of 
these other binding enforceable commitments for installation and operation of advanced NOx 
and SO2 pollution controls across much of the Eastern US.  In providing the results of the 
EPA’s analysis with IPM, the Agency is using the results for the model’s 2015 run year 
(which covers years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017) as a proxy for 2014 results.  IPM provides 
actual results for 2012, 2015, and 2020. 
 To address air quality problems and improve public health and the environment, EPA 
is proposing the Transport Rule.  The proposed Transport Rule requires annual SO2 and NOx 
reductions in 27 states and the District of Columbia, and also requires ozone season NOx 
reductions in 25 States and the District of Columbia.  Many of the Transport Rule States are 
affected by both the annual SO2 and NOx reduction requirements and the ozone season NOx 
requirements. 
The rule would affect roughly 5,000 fossil fuel-fired units with a nameplate capacity 
greater than 25 MW.  These sources accounted for roughly 84 percent of nationwide SO2 
emissions and 73 percent of nationwide NOx emissions in 2008 (see Table 7-1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
53 These include current and future state programs in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, 
Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin the cover NOx and SO2 emissions controls.

For SO2 and annual NOx, EPA modeled control requirements beginning in 2012 for 
the 27 eastern states shown in blue and green in Figure 7-1 below.  In 15 of those states 
(shown in blue), more stringent SO2 requirements begin in 2014.  For ozone-season NOx, 
separate ozone-season requirements were applied to the 25 states shown in blue in Figure 7-
2.  Many of the Transport Rule states are affected by both the annual SO2 and NOx reduction 
requirements and the ozone-season (May–September) NOx requirements.  Tables 7-2 and 7-3 
show the emission budgets allotted to each state.  For further discussion about the scope and 
requirements of the Transport Rule, see the Transport Rule preamble or Chapter 2 of this 
RIA.

EPA modeling54 shows that coal-fired and oil/gas-fired generation will continue to 
play an important part of the electricity generating portfolio in the United States.  Electricity 
                                                 
54 EPA uses the IPM to make power-sector forecasts about emissions, costs, and other key factors of the power 
sector.  Industry projections presented here are from EPA’s base case scenario.  For more information about 
IPM, see http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm/.

demand is anticipated to grow by roughly 1 percent a year, and total electricity demand is 
projected to be 4,333 billion kWh by 2014.  Table 7-4 shows current electricity generation 
and projected levels in 2012, 2014, and 2020 using EPA IPM modeling. The increasing 
growth of coal-fired generation and decline of generation from units using natural gas and oil 
results primarily due to the relative prices of the fuels in EPA’s IPM forecast and the energy 
efficiency of the generation technologies in producing electricity.  IPM in essence is using 
EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook for 2008’s electric demand forecast for the US and estimating 
the mix of fossil generation based on its on fuel price projections and assumptions on 
performance and costs of electric generation technologies.  The base case assumption that 
CAIR is not in effect does have some modest influence on the fossil generation mix in this 
forecast, because CAIR had increased the costs of coal-fired generation relatively more than 
it had increased the costs to generation units that burned oil or natural gas.55

While EPA is proposing one particular remedy for the Transport Rule, State 
Budgets/Limited Trading, it is also requesting comment on the alternatives of State 
Budgets/Intrastate Trading and Direct Control.  These two alternatives represent the range of 
myriad alternatives considered by EPA for this rule.  While their features and impacts 
inevitably differ in some respects, the alternatives are distinct ways to try to achieve the same 
emissions reductions as the proposed remedy. 
                                                 
55 For the same time period, the Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook for 2010 shows a 
small amount of growth in coal-fired electric generation, no growth in electric generation using oil, and a similar 
trend in generation from natural gas, which declines through 2014 and increases between 2014 and 2020. 
  
 
 
 
 
242 
The main difference between the three remedies lies in the kinds of flexibility they 
provide for compliance.  State Budgets/Limited Trading allows sources to trade within state 
lines and, as long as state emissions remain within the budgets plus variability limits, across 
state lines as well.  State Budgets/Intrastate Trading caps each state’s emissions at its budget 
without variability and only allows trading within (and not between) states.  Under Direct 
Control, each EGU must meet an emission rate limit, and a state’s emissions must remain 
within its budget plus variability.  Even though 2012 rate limits are designed to be met 
without installing unplanned controls, individual rates still offer less flexibility than trading.  
Details on the derivation of unit-specific rate limits for Direct Control can be found in the 
TSD, “State Budgets, Unit Allocations, and Unit Emissions Rates.” 
Even under Direct Control, the proposed rule provides some flexibility.  Notably, in 
addition to allowing total emissions up to the budget plus variability limit, units in the same 
state within the same company are allowed to average their rates together.  As described in 
section 7.11 below, intra-state, intra-company averaging is not modeled in IPM, while the 
variability provision is.  Further details on Direct Control, State Budgets/Intrastate Trading, 
and the preferred State Budgets/Limited Trading can be found in Section V. of the Transport 
Rule preamble. 
As noted above, IPM has been used for evaluating the economic and emission 
impacts of environmental policies for over a decade.  The economic modeling presented in 
this chapter has been developed for specific analyses of the power sector.  Thus, the model 
has been designed to reflect the industry as accurately as possible.  As a result, EPA has used 
discount rates in IPM that are appropriate for the various types of investments and other costs 
that the power sector incurs.  The primary real discount rate is 5.5 % for pollution control 
retrofits, fuel costs, allowance prices, and most generation technologies’ capital and 
operating expenses.56  The discount rates used in IPM differ from discount rates used in other 
RIA analyses done for the Transport Rule, particularly the discount rates used in the benefits 
and macroeconomic analyses that are assumed to be social discount rates. (See Chapters 5 
and 8 where social discount rates of 3 % and 7 % are used.)  EPA uses the best available 
information from utilities, financial institutions, debt rating agencies, and government

statistics as the basis for the discount rates used for power sector modeling in IPM.  These 
discount rates have undergone review by the power sector and the Energy Information 
Administration. 
More detail on IPM can be found in the model documentation, which provides 
additional information on the assumptions discussed here as well as all other assumptions 
and inputs to the model (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm).  Updates 
specific to Transport Rule modeling are also in the TSD “Updates to EPA Base Case v3.02 
EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model.” 
 
7.2 Projected SO2 and NOx Emissions and Reductions 
Both the proposed Transport Rule remedy and the alternative remedies achieve 
substantial emissions reductions.  Under each of these remedies, EPA projects annual SO2 
emission reductions of greater than 60 percent and annual NOx emissions reductions of 
greater than 33 percent in the respective remedy regions by 2014 relative to the base case.  
Additionally, EPA projects ozone-season NOx reductions of greater than 15 percent in the 
Transport Rule region (see Table 7-5).  On the other hand, differences among the remedies 
the incentive for emissions banking can lead to slight differences in the timing of SO2 
reductions.  The following section describes the emission results for each remedy. 
In Figure 7-3 below, the results of EPA modeling of State Budgets/Limited Trading, 
the Transport Rule proposed remedy, show that substantial SO2 emissions reductions occur 
in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the country.  Because banking of allowances is 
allowed to encourage early reductions, 2012 SO2 reductions are greater overall than state 
budgets alone would require in that year.  For many coal-fired electric generation units 
throughout the region it is economically advantageous to make extra emissions reductions in 
2012 through fuel switching to have allowances to later use or sell in 2014 and beyond.  This 
is when the Transport Rule becomes more stringent and when electric generators will also 
need to meet higher electric demand.  Because of the banking provisions, the relative 
economics of making pollution reductions below the emissions cap levels in 2012 versus 
making emissions reductions later favor doing more in 2012.  Annual NOx emissions 
  
 
 
 
 
244 
reductions occur across the Transport Rule region (see Figure 7-4), and with the Transport 
Rule, ozone-season NOx emissions reductions are lower than they would have been with the 
NOx SIP Call (base case) (see Figure 7-5).

 Emissions for State Budgets/Intrastate Trading are shown in Table 7-5 above and in 
Figures 7-6, 7-7, and 7-8 below.  Compared to the proposed remedy, State Budgets/Intrastate 
Trading achieves slightly more SO2 reduction in 2012 (and slightly less in 2014), as Table 7-
5 shows above.  For this remedy, each state’s emissions were restricted to the state budget 
without variability.  Without the opportunity for even limited trading of allowances across 
state borders, more banking was projected in some states than in the proposed remedy.  In 
other states, more immediate emissions reductions (relative to the base case) are projected; 
because sources cannot purchase allowances from outside their own state, state budgets must 
be met exactly.  Both of these factors lead to slightly greater SO2 reductions in 2012 than in 
the State Budgets/Limited Trading.

 Emissions for Direct Control are shown in Table 7-5 above and in Figures 7-9, 7-10, 
and 7-11 below.  Compared to State Budgets/Limited Trading, Direct Control results in less 
SO2 reduction in 2012 (see Table 7-5).  Because it does not allow banking for early 
reductions, the Direct Control alternative does not result in reductions below state budgets in 
2012. The absence of banking does not lead to lower emissions relative to the other proposed 
remedies in 2014 because total emissions in each state can still be as high as the state’s 
budget plus variability limit with the Direct Control option.

7.3 Overview of Costs and Other Impacts 
 As shown above in Figures 7-1 and 7-2, the Transport Rule directly affects 27 states 
and the District of Columbia in controlling pollution related to fine particles.  For ozone, it 
also affects a distinct but overlapping group of 25 states and the District of Columbia.  The 
states in one or both of these regions constitute most of the fossil-fuel-fired generation and 
capacity in the contiguous US, especially coal-fired (see Tables 7-6 and 7-7 below).

 While most impacts of the Transport Rule affect the covered states themselves, 
national impacts are important.  Because the electric grid is connected irrespective of state 
boundaries, effects on electrical generation in one state have spillover effects in other states.  
Likewise, because the Transport Rule states have the vast majority of coal-fired generation, 
changes in their coal consumption and demand affect coal prices nationwide.  In some cases, 
such as retail electricity prices and the operation of pollution controls, nationwide 
information would not be as relevant as regional totals.  But for most of the following 
sections, nationwide projections provide a more complete picture of the Transport Rule’s 
impacts. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
255 
7.4 Projected Compliance Costs 
The power industry’s “compliance costs” are the changes in electric power generation 
costs in the base case and alternative pollution control approaches that are examined in this 
chapter.  In simple terms, these costs are the resource costs of what the power industry will 
directly expend to comply with EPA’s requirements.  This is not the “social cost” of the 
control approaches, which is separately explained and estimated in EMPAX modeling in 
Chapter 8 that follows. 
EPA projects that the annual incremental compliance costs of the Transport Rule 
proposed remedy (State Budgets/Limited Trading) are $3.7 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in 
2014 (see Table 7-8 below).  Another measure of this impact is the change in electricity 
prices (discussed in section 7.9).  Costs generally are higher in 2012 than in 2014 because of 
reduced compliance flexibility in 2012, which is too soon for sources to retrofit new FGD 
and SCR that were not already planned.

Note: Numbers rounded to the nearest hundred million for annualized cost. 
Source: Integrated Planning Model run by EPA. 
 
Though based on the same state budgets as State Budgets/Limited Trading, State 
Budgets/Intrastate Trading costs approximately $0.5 billion dollars more in 2012, as Table 7-
8 shows above.  As mentioned above in the context of emissions reductions, more banking is 
projected in some states and more immediate emissions reductions (relative to the base case) 
in others, both because the flexibility of trading between states is not available.  These 
factors drive 2012 costs higher than those of State Budgets/Limited Trading. 
The allowance prices of the two alternatives that allow emissions trading are provided 
in Appendix E. 
The Direct Control alternative remedy costs $0.6 billion more than the proposed 
  
 
 
 
 
256 
remedy in 2012 and 2014.  Based on source-specific emissions rates, it provides less 
flexibility for compliance than either of the trading remedies.  For example, demand for the 
lowest-sulfur grades of coal is higher in the Direct Control case even relative to the next-
lowest grades.  In this case, many unscrubbed units have rates that require either using the 
lowest-sulfur grade of coal or installing new controls, even though slightly higher-sulfur coal 
would likely be economical for some if trading were an option. 
 
7.5 Projected Approaches to Emissions Reductions  
Emission reductions of NOx and SO2 for the alternative pollution control remedies 
that EPA examined are achieved through a combination of compliance options by electric 
generation units using fossil fuels in the Transport Region.  These actions include full 
operation of existing controls that are in place that were noneconomic to operate under the 
base case, additional pollution control installations, coal switching (including blending of 
coals), and generation shifts towards more efficient electricity producing units and lower-
emitting generation technologies (e.g., some reduction of coal-fired generation with an 
increase of generation from natural gas).  Notably, only coal-fired generation units actually 
install and operate added pollution controls in response to control alternatives.  In 2012 and 
2014, there are similar, but somewhat different sets of actions that EPA’s modeling predicts 
will occur. 
In 2012 in the State Budgets/Limited Trading option (preferred approach), a small 
shift from coal-fired and oil generation to greater use of natural gas lowers emissions a small 
amount (see Table 7-12).  NOx emissions reductions largely occur when on coal-fired units, 
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) controls that were only required to operate in the ozone 
season in the base case now operate throughout the year (see Table 7-11).  Additionally, in 
states that were not in the original CAIR program but are covered in summer ozone season 
program of this rule there is a modest amount of NOx reduction stemming from low- NOx 
burners that are installed on coal-fired units.  SO2 emissions reductions result from the 
relatively high allowances values for the SO2 programs, which makes it economic for all 
FGDs (scrubbers) that EPA estimates are in place by 2012 to operate under the preferred 
control option.  High allowance values also lead to considerable coal switching to lower 
  
 
 
 
 
257 
sulfur coals as the least cost compliance approach for many coal-fired units without FGDs. 
Examining the changes in use of coals with differing sulfur contents as laid out in 
Table 7-9 below is helpful in considering what EPA estimates will occur from the base case 
to the preferred approach in the rule.  For coal-fired generation units that do not operate 
FGDs in the base case, about 30 % of power generated by these units is from high sulfur 
coals; 10 % of the power generated is from high-medium sulfur coals; and 15 % of the power 
generated is from low-medium sulfur coals.  The percentages for power generation from 
cleaner coals are close to 1 %, 15 %, and 30 % for low sulfur bituminous, low sulfur 
subbituminous, and very low sulfur subbituminous respectively. Under the preferred 
approach, for the units that do not have FGDs, power generation from the units using high, 
high-medium, and low-medium sulfur coals changes to about 2 %, 5 %, and 30 %, 
respectively.  For the cleaner coals, the percentages of power generation from units without 
FGDs under the preferred approach were about 3 %, less than 1 %, and 60 % for low-sulfur 
bituminous, low sulfur subbituminous, and very low sulfur subbituminous respectively. 
 
Table 7-9.  Coal Sulfur Categories (lbs/mmBTU) 
High sulfur > 1.2 
Low sulfur 0.7 to 1.2 Subbituminous 
Very low sulfur < 0.7 
High sulfur > 2 
High-medium sulfur 1.4 to 2 
Low-medium sulfur 0.9 to 1.4 Bituminous 
Low sulfur < 0.9 
Lignite All grades 0.6 to 4 
 
 
Table 7-10 shows total coal use among both scrubbed and unscrubbed EGUs in the 
states subject to the proposed SO2 programs.  The preferred remedy approach (State 
Budgets/Limited Trading) is associated with only a slight reduction (1% in 2014) in total 
coal use among these units compared to the base case.  More importantly, the table reinforces 
that the preferred approach drives increased overall use of cleaner bituminous and 
subbituminous coals, especially very low sulfur subbituminous.  This trend appears even 
  
 
 
 
 
258 
when, as in this table, coal use of scrubbed units and very small units are included.

*These coal usage results are for the 28 states covered by the rule in the trading program to reduce SO2 emissions. 
 
In 2014, the preferred approach to the Transport Rule is projected to result in the 
operation of an additional 40 GW of flue gas desulfurization (scrubbers) for SO2 control on 
existing coal-fired generation capacity and the year-round operation of an additional 51 GW 
of selective catalytic reduction technology (SCR) for NOx control on existing coal-fired 
generation capacity by 2014 (see Table 7-11).  This accounts for the vast majority of the NOx 
reduction.  A small number of coal-fired units also install selective non-catalytic reduction 
technology (SNCR) for NOx control under the preferred approach to the Transport Rule. 
For SO2, the reductions from the added FGDs are also supplemented by the continued 
and expanded use of relatively cleaner coals at uncontrolled units.  Notably, many of the 
FGDs that are coming into operation are built due to control requirements other than the 
Transport Rule and only 14 GWs of capacity with newly constructed FGDs are resulting 
from the preferred approach.

7.6 Projected Generation Mix 
Table 7-12 and Figure 7-12 show the generation mix with the Transport Rule.  Coal-
fired generation and natural-gas-fired generation are projected to remain relatively 
unchanged because of the phased-in nature of the Transport Rule, which allows industry the 
appropriate amount of time to install the necessary pollution controls.  Both the base case and 
all three remedies show shifts away from oil and natural gas generation and toward increased 
coal generation between 2012 and 2014.

projections from the Integrated Planning Model run by EPA, 2010. 
 
Relative to the base case, about 1.2 GW of coal-fired capacity is projected to be 
uneconomic to maintain (less than 1 percent of all coal-fired capacity in the Transport Rule 
states) by 2014.  Uneconomic units, for the most part, are small and infrequently used 
generating units that are dispersed throughout the states covered in the Transport Rule.  In 
practice, units projected to be uneconomic to maintain may be “mothballed,” retired, or kept 
in service to ensure transmission reliability in certain parts of the grid.  EPA modeling is 
unable to distinguish between these potential outcomes.  IPM can only predict that specific 
generating units are uneconomic to maintain, based on their fuel, operating and fixed costs, 
and whether they are needed to meet both demand and reliability reserve requirements. 
Though similar to the proposed remedy, the alternative remedies result in slightly 
different projections of uneconomic units.  State Budgets/Intrastate Trading results in 1.6 
  
 
 
 
 
262 
GW of such capacity by 2014, 0.4 GW more than in State Budgets/Limited Trading.  In 
contrast, Direct Control yields only 0.5 GW in 2014 (0.7 GW less than the proposed 
remedy). 
 
7.7 Projected Capacity Additions 
In addition, EPA projects that most future growth in electric demand will be met with 
a combination of new natural gas- and coal-fired capacity (see Table 7-13).  This occurs in 
the base case, under the proposed Transport Rule, and under both alternative remedies.

7.8 Projected Coal Production for the Electric Power Sector 
Coal production for electricity generation is expected to increase relative to current 
levels, with or without the Transport Rule (see Table 7-14).  The reductions in emissions 
from the power sector will be met through the installation and operation of pollution controls 
for SO2 and NOx removal.  Many of these pollution controls can achieve SO2 removal rates 
of 95 percent or greater, which allows industry to rely more heavily on local bituminous coal 
in the eastern and central parts of the country that has a higher sulfur content and is less 
expensive to transport than western subbituminous coal.

Regional retail electricity prices are projected to be 1 to 3 percent higher with the Transport 
Rule.  Retail electricity prices by NERC region are provided in Table 7-16 (see Figure 7-13). 
 These results show increases in retail prices for the NERC regions in the eastern part of the 
country.  By 2014, retail electricity prices in the regions directly affected by the Transport 
Rule are projected to be roughly 1.5 percent higher with the Transport Rule (Table 7-15).

7.10 Projected Fuel Price Impacts 
The impacts of the Transport Rule on coal prices and natural gas prices before 
shipment are shown below in Tables 7-17 and 7-18.  The proposed remedy and two 
alternative remedies have the same effect on natural gas prices, but somewhat different 
effects on coal prices, reflecting differing effects of the remedies on mix of coal types used 
based on their sulfur content.  Overall, average coal price changes are related to increased 
demand for a wide variety of coals, with the dominant factor being increased use of lower-
sulfur coals.  For example, under Direct Control, complying with unit-specific emission rates 
drives many uncontrolled units to demand only the lowest-sulfur grade of coal available.  
Conversely, in the proposed remedy, the incentive of the SO2 allowance markets not only 
influences the relative demand for every coal grade (allowing cost-effective coal blending) 
  
 
 
 
 
266 
but also affects other decisions such as dispatch, leading to an outcome with a less 
pronounced effect on any single coal grade.  Commensurate with its flexibility relative to the 
other remedies, State Budgets/Intrastate Trading, in which units in different states have no 
opportunity to trade, leads to a greater average price increase than in the proposed remedy, 
but significantly less than under Direct Control.

7.11 Key Differences in EPA Model Runs for Transport Rule Modeling 
 As previously stated, the emissions, cost, air quality, and benefits analyses done for 
the Transport Rule are from a modeling scenario that requires annual SO2 and NOx 
reductions in 27 states and ozone season NOx requirements in 25 states (See Figures 7-1 and 
7-2).  This modeling differs from the proposed Transport Rule because the District of 
Columbia is included neither in the annual SO2 and NOx requirements nor in the ozone 
season NOx requirement.  Modeled units in the District of Columbia include two small 
facilities, one of which has only units below 25 MW capacity.  EPA believes the addition of 
  
 
 
 
 
267 
emissions limits in the District of Columbia would have little to no effect on the modeling 
results. 
 Also, the modeling of the Direct Control alternative remedy did not include an 
emissions averaging provision, due to its dependence on EGU ownership information.  
Because this provision provides additional compliance flexibility, EPA believes it would not 
increase modeled compliance costs for this remedy and would have little to no effect on total 
emissions.  2012 budgets largely reflect installed controls, planned controls, and fuel 
switching that would lead to actual emission rates similar to allowable emission rates, so the 
effect of not modeling firm averaging on estimated cost impacts from IPM in the first phase 
are likely to not be substantial.  In the second phase modeling, additional scrubbers are 
required based on which EGUs IPM projects have the lowest-cost opportunities for installing 
incremental scrubbers (which are also likely to be similar to utility projections of lowest-cost 
controls).  Therefore, EPA believes that even if the flexibility provisions were modeled, they 
would not significantly impact modeled cost in either the first or second phase.  Notably, in 
reality this flexibility could provide cost savings for dealing with unplanned outages, sudden 
price changes, and other dynamic costs of power-sector operation not modeled in IPM. 
 
7.12 Projected Primary PM and Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Power Plants 
IPM does not project primary PM emissions from power plants.  These emissions are 
calculated using IPM outputs and emission factors.  Fuel use (heat input) as projected by 
IPM is multiplied by PM emission factors to determine PM emissions.  Primary PM 
emissions are calculated by adding the filterable PM and condensable PM emissions.   
Filterable PM emissions for each unit are based on historical information regarding 
installed emissions controls and types of fuel burned and ash content.  Condensable PM 
emission factors are based on existing SO2 and PM controls, plant and fuel type. 
This methodology tends to underpredict reductions in filterable PM emissions 
between the base case and the control case (especially when a unit does not have a high 
removal efficiency ESP or baghouse) because no changes are assumed in the emission 
  
 
 
 
 
268 
factors even if a unit is projected to install a control such as an FGD, which could lead to a 
decrease in filterable PM emissions. 
For condensable PM emissions, emission factors were changed between the base case 
and the control case to reflect SO2 controls projected to be installed in the control case.  
Although EPA used the best emission factors available for its analysis, these emission factors 
did not account for the potential changes in condensable PM emissions due to the installation 
and operation of SCRs.  The formation of additional condensable PM (in the form of SO3 and 
H2SO4) in units with SCRs depends on a number of factors, including coal sulfur content, 
combustion conditions and characteristics of the catalyst used in the SCR, and is likely to 
vary widely from unit to unit.  SCRs are generally designed and operated so that they 
minimize increases in condensable PM.  This limitation leads to an overprediction of 
reductions in condensable PM emissions for units with SCRs.  For a more complete 
description of the methodologies used to post-process PM emissions from IPM, see “IPM 
ORL File Generation Methodology,” October 2007. 
IPM provides EPA estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for fossil fuel 
electric generation as a standard output from the model, enabling consideration of the 
changes in CO2 emissions that result from pollution control alternatives.57 EPA found that the 
State Budget/Limited Trading option (preferred approach) lowered CO2 emissions from the 
Base Case in 2014 by 15.3 million metric tons.  This occurs due to reductions in coal and oil 
use and greater use of natural gas and non-fossil sources of electric generation (e.g., biomass 
cogeneration and nuclear generation, with one fewer unit retiring.) 
EPA is not using IPM to project the impacts of this proposed rule on mercury.  EPA 
recently commissioned an information collection request that will soon provide greatly 
improved power industry mercury emissions estimates that will enable the Agency to better 
estimate mercury emissions changes from its air emissions control actions. For this reason, 
the Agency did not estimate mercury changes in this rule and will instead wait for these new 
data, which will be available in the near future. 
                                                 
57 The CO2 emissions factors for fossil fuels used in IPM are: oil = 173.9 lbs/mmbtu, natural gas = 117 
lbs/mmbtu, bituminous coal = 202–205 lbs/mmbtu, subbituminous coal = 208–211 lbs/mmbtu, and lignite = 
211–217 lbs/mmbtu.

7.13 Limitations of Analysis 
EPA’s modeling is based on its best judgment for various input assumptions that are 
uncertain.  Assumptions for future fuel prices and electricity demand growth deserve 
particular attention because of the importance of these two key model inputs to the power 
sector.  As a general matter, the Agency selects the best available information from available 
engineering studies of air pollution controls and has set up what it believes is the most 
reasonable modeling framework for analyzing the cost, emission changes, and other impacts 
of regulatory controls. 
The annualized cost estimates of the private compliance costs that are provided in this 
analysis are meant to show the increase in production (engineering) costs to the power sector 
of the Transport Rule proposed remedy and major alternatives.  In simple terms, the private 
compliance costs that are presented are the annual increase in revenues required for the 
industry to be as well off after the Transport Rule is implemented as before.  To estimate 
these annualized costs, EPA uses a conventional and widely-accepted approach that is 
commonplace in economic analysis of power sector costs for estimating engineering costs in 
annual terms.  For estimating annualized costs, EPA has applied a capital recovery factor 
(CRF) multiplier to capital investments and added that to the annual incremental operating 
expenses.  The CRF is derived from estimates of the cost of capital (private discount rate), 
the amount of insurance coverage required, local property taxes, and the life of capital.  The 
private compliance costs presented earlier are EPA’s best estimate of the direct private 
compliance costs of the Transport Rule. 
The annualized cost of the Transport Rule, as quantified here, is EPA’s best 
assessment of the cost of implementing the Transport Rule.  These costs are generated from 
rigorous economic modeling of changes in the power sector due to the Transport Rule.  This 
type of analysis using IPM has undergone peer review and federal courts have upheld 
regulations covering the power sector that have relied on IPM’s cost analysis. 
The direct private compliance cost includes, but is not limited to, capital investments 
in pollution controls, operating expenses of the pollution controls, investments in new 
  
 
 
 
 
270 
generating sources, and additional fuel expenditures.  EPA believes that the cost assumptions 
used for the Transport Rule reflect, as closely as possible, the best information available to 
the Agency today.  The relatively small cost associated with monitoring emissions, reporting, 
and record keeping for affected sources is not included in these annualized cost estimates, 
but EPA has done a separate analysis and estimated the cost to be approximately $28 million 
(see Section 9.3., Paperwork Reduction Act). 
Cost estimates for the Transport Rule are based on results from ICF’s Integrated 
Planning Model.  The model minimizes the costs of producing electricity (including 
abatement costs) while meeting load demand and other constraints (full documentation for 
IPM can be found at http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm and in the TSD 
“Updates to EPA Base Case v3.02 EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model”).  The 
structure of the model assumes that the electric utility industry will be able to meet the 
environmental emission caps at least cost.  Montgomery (1972) has shown that this least cost 
solution corresponds to the equilibrium of an emission permit system.  See also Atkinson and 
Tietenburg (1982), Krupnick et al. (1980), and McGartland and Oates (1985).  However, to 
the extent that transaction and/or search costs, combined with institutional barriers, restrict 
the ability of utilities to exhaust all the gains from emissions trading, costs are 
underestimated by the model.  Utilities in the IPM model also have “perfect foresight.”  To 
the extent that utilities misjudge future conditions affecting the economics of pollution 
control, costs may be understated as well. 
The “perfect foresight” of the model is also relevant in the context of the assurance 
provisions required in the proposed remedy (State Budgets/Limited Trading) and Direct 
Control.  Because of the sizeable penalties associated with violating assurance provisions, 
EPA believes it will be economical for units to comply with the provisions.  EPA modeled 
these provisions, which restrict emissions from a state to the budget plus variability limits on 
a 1-year and 3-year rolling average basis, as state-specific emissions caps set at the budget 
plus 3-year average variability.  The Power Sector Variability Technical Support Document 
contains further details on these assurance provisions. 
Modeling the assurance provisions as caps means that the model must meet the same 
limit each year, but it also allows the model to optimize with perfect foresight of present and 
  
 
 
 
 
271 
future limits.  While the model minimizes production costs while meeting required 
generation and reserve margin, sources in reality may choose to make greater emissions 
reductions than required in exchange for more certainty about emissions variability.  IPM 
captures the cost associated with making required reductions in each state, but because of its 
“perfect foresight,” the model likely cannot capture the true benefit to sources of having a 
range of allowed variability. 
From another vantage point, this modeling analysis does not take into account the 
potential for advancements in the capabilities of pollution control technologies for SO2 and 
NOx removal as well as reductions in their costs over time.  Market-based cap and trade 
regulation serves to promote innovation and the development of new and cheaper 
technologies.  As an example, cost estimates of the Acid Rain SO2 trading program by 
Resources for the Future (RFF) and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy 
Research (CEEPR) have been as much as 83 percent lower than originally projected by the 
EPA (see Carlson et al., 2000; Ellerman, 2003).  It is important to note that the original 
analysis for the Acid Rain Program done by EPA also relied on an optimization model like 
IPM.  Ex ante, EPA cost estimates of roughly $2.7 to $6.2 billion58 in 1989 were an 
overestimate of the costs of the program in part because of the limitation of economic 
modeling to predict technological improvement of pollution controls and other compliance 
options such as fuel switching.  Ex post estimates of the annual cost of the Acid Rain SO2 
trading program range from $1.0 to $1.4 billion.  Harrington et al. have examined cost 
analyses of EPA programs and found a tendency for predicted costs to overstate actual 
implementation costs in market-based programs (Harrington, Morgenstern, and Nelson, 
2000).  In recognition of this, EPA’s mobile source program uses adjusted engineering cost 
estimates of pollution control equipment and installation costs to account for this fact, which 
EPA has not done in this case.59  The Agency is considering approaches to make this 
adjustment in the future, or at least to be able to provide a sense of the rough amount by

EPA’s latest update of IPM incorporates state rules or regulations and various NSR 
settlements adopted through February 3, 2009.  Documentation for IPM can be found at 
http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm and in the TSD “Updates to EPA Base 
Case v3.02 EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model.”.  Any state or settlement action 
since that time has not been accounted for in our analysis in this chapter. 
As configured in this application, IPM does not take into account demand response 
(i.e., consumer reaction to electricity prices).  The increased retail electricity prices shown in 
Tables 7-15 and 7-16 would prompt end users to curtail (to some extent) their use of 
electricity and encourage them to use substitutes.60  The response would lessen the demand 
for electricity, resulting in electricity price increases slightly lower than IPM predicts, which 
would also reduce generation and emissions.  Because of demand response, certain 
unquantified negative costs (i.e., savings) result from the reduced resource costs of producing 
less electricity because of the lower quantity demanded.  To some degree, these saved 
resource costs will offset the additional costs of pollution controls and fuel switching that we 
would anticipate with the Transport Rule.  Although the reduction in electricity use is likely 
to be small, the cost savings from such a large industry61 is not insignificant.  EIA analysis 
examining multi-pollutant legislation under consideration in 2003 indicates that the 
annualized costs of the Transport Rule may be overstated substantially by not considering 
demand response, depending on the magnitude and coverage of the price increases.62 
On balance, after consideration of various unquantified costs (and savings that are 
possible), EPA believes that the annual private compliance costs that we have estimated are 
more likely to overstate the future annual compliance costs that industry will incur, rather 
than understate those costs. 
                                                 
60   The degree of substitution/curtailment depends on the costs and performance of the goods that substitute for 
more energy consuming goods, which is reflected in the demand elasticity. 
61 Investor-owned utilities alone accounted for nearly $300 billion in revenue in 2008 (EIA). 
62 See “Analysis of S. 485, the Clear Skies Act of 2003, and S. 843, the Clean Air Planning Act of 2003.”  
Energy Information Administration. September, 2003.  EIA modeling indicated that the Clear Skies Act of 
2003 (a nationwide cap and trade program for SO2, NOX, and mercury), demand response could lower present 
value costs by as much as 47% below what it would have been without an emission constraint similar to the 
Transport Rule.

7.14 Significant Energy Impact 
The Transport Rule as proposed has significant impact according to E.O. 13211: 
Actions that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use.  Under the provisions 
of this proposed rule, EPA projects that approximately 1.2 GW of coal-fired generation may 
be removed from operation by 2014 under the proposed remedy.  In practice, however, the 
units projected to be uneconomic to maintain may be “mothballed,” retired, or kept in service 
to ensure transmission reliability in certain parts of the grid.  These units are predominantly 
small and infrequently-used generating units dispersed throughout the area affected by the 
rule.  Assumptions of higher natural gas prices or electricity demand would create a greater 
incentive to keep these units operational. 
The EPA estimates that there are several fuel price increases resulting from the 
proposed remedy in the Transport Rule.  The EPA projects that the average retail electricity 
price could increase nationally by about 2.5 percent in 2012 and 1.5 percent in 2014.  This is 
generally less of an increase than often occurs with fluctuating fuel prices and other market 
factors.  Related to this, delivered coal prices increase by about 7 percent in 2012 and 4 
percent in 2014 as a result of higher demand for lower-sulfur coals.  The EPA also projects 
that delivered natural gas prices will increase by less than 1.7 percent in 2012 and 0.5 percent 
in 2014 and that natural gas use for electricity generation will increase by less than 73 
million million cubic feet (mcf) by 2014.  The price increase is also within the range we 
regularly see in delivered natural gas prices.  Finally, the EPA projects coal production for 
use by the power sector, a large component of total coal production, will decrease by 3 
million tons in 2012 and 9 million tons in 2014 from the base case levels, which is a 
relatively small amount compared to the more than one billion tons of coal produced for 
utility use each year.  The EPA does not believe that this rule will have any other impacts 
that exceed the significance criteria. 
The EPA believes that a number of features of the rulemaking serve to reduce its 
impact on energy supply.  First, the trading programs in State Budgets/Limited Trading 
provide considerable flexibility to the power sector and enable industry to comply with the 
emission reduction requirements in the most cost-effective manner, thus minimizing overall 
  
 
 
 
 
274 
costs and the ultimate impact on energy supply.  Second, the more stringent budgets for SO2 
are set in two phases, providing adequate time for EGUs to install pollution controls.  In 
addition, both the operational flexibility of trading and the ability to bank allowances for 
future years helps industry plan for and ensure reliability in the electrical system.

CHAPTER 8 
MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS AND SOCIAL COSTS  
EPA prepares an economic impact analysis (EIA) to provide decision makers with a 
measure of the social costs of using resources to comply with a program (EPA, 2000). The 
social costs can then be compared with estimated social benefits. As noted in EPA’s (2000) 
Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses, several tools are available to estimate social 
costs and range from simple direct compliance cost methods to the development of a more 
complex market analysis.  The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) 
adopted an economy-wide market analysis as described in the Office’s Economic Resource 
Manual (EPA, 1999)63 and uses the latest EMPAX computable general equilibrium modeling 
system.   
The Economic Model for Policy Analysis (EMPAX) was first developed in 2000 to 
support economic analysis of EPA’s maximum achievable control technology (MACT) rules 
for combustion sources (reciprocating internal combustion engines, industrial boilers, and 
turbines). The initial framework consisted of a national multi-market partial-equilibrium 
model with linkages only between manufacturing industries and the energy sector. Modified 
versions of EMPAX were subsequently used to analyze economic impacts of strategies for 
improving air quality in the Southern Appalachian mountain region as part of efforts in 2002 
associated with the Southern Appalachian Mountain Initiative (SAMI). Later work extended 
its scope to cover all aspects of the U.S. economy with regional detail.  
Since large-scale environmental policies also indirectly influence current and future 
input uses, income, and household consumption patterns, EPA subsequently updated the 
model system to include a complete set of economic linkages among all industrial and energy 
sectors as well as households that supply factors of production such as labor and purchase 
goods (i.e., a computable general equilibrium [CGE] framework). As a result, EMPAX is 
now a dynamic general equilibrium model that traces economic impacts as they are 
transmitted across time and throughout the economy. EMPAX-CGE underwent peer review 
                                                 
63  This document is available on the Internet at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/analguid.html.

in 2006; detailed model documentation and results of the peer review can be accessed at the 
following Web site: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/EMPAXCGE.htm.    
8.1 EMPAX Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model: Overview  
EMPAX-CGE is a dynamic, intertemporally optimizing model that solves in 5-year 
intervals from 2010 to 2050. It uses the classical Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium 
framework wherein households maximize utility subject to budget constraints, and firms 
maximize profits subject to technology constraints. The model structure, in which agents are 
assumed to have perfect foresight and to maximize utility across all time periods, allows 
agents to modify behavior in anticipation of future policy changes, unlike dynamic recursive 
models that assume agents do not react until a policy has been implemented.  
Nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions are used to portray 
substitution possibilities available to producers and consumers. Figure 8-1 illustrates this 
general framework and gives a broad characterization of the model.64 Along with the 
underlying data, these nesting structures and associated substitution elasticities determine the 
effects that will be estimated for policies. These nesting structures and elasticities used in 
EMPAX-CGE are generally based on the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) 
Model developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Paltsev et al., 2005). This 
updated version of the EPPA model incorporates some extensions over the EPPA version 
documented in Babiker et al. (2001), such as specification of transportation purchases by 
households. These updates to transportation choices have been incorporated in this version of 
EMPAX-CGE as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 8-1. Although the two models 
continue to have different focuses (EPPA is a recursive dynamic, international model focused 
on national-level climate change policies), both are intended to simulate how agents will 
respond to environmental policies; thus, EPPA provides a strong basis to develop the 
theoretical structure of EMPAX-CGE. 
 
 
                                                 
64 Although it is not illustrated in Figure 8-1, some differences across industries exist in their handling of 
energy inputs. In addition, the agriculture and fossil fuel sectors in EMPAX-CGE contain equations that account 
for the presence of fixed inputs to production (land and fossil-fuel resources, respectively).

Given this basic similarity, EMPAX-CGE has adopted a comparable structure. 
EMPAX-CGE is programmed in the GAMS65 language (Generalized Algebraic Modeling 
System) and solved as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP)66 using MPSGE software 
(Mathematical Programming Subsystem for General Equilibrium).67 The PATH solver from 
GAMS is used to solve the MCP equations generated by MPSGE. 
8.1.1 Data Sources 
The economic data come from state-level information provided by the Minnesota 
IMPLAN Group (2006),68 and energy data come from the Energy Information 
Administration (EIA).69 Forecasts for economic growth are taken from EIA’s Annual Energy 
Outlook 2009 Updated Reference Case (AEO) and Global Insight (2007).70 Although 
IMPLAN data contain information on the value of energy production and consumption in 
dollars, these data are replaced with EIA data since the policies being investigated by 
EMPAX-CGE typically focus on energy markets, making it essential to include the best 
possible characterization of these markets in the model. Although the IMPLAN data are 
developed from a variety of government data sources at the U.S. Bureau of Economic 
Analysis and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, these data do not always agree with energy 
information collected by EIA directly from manufacturers and electric utilities.  
EMPAX-CGE combines these economic and energy data to create a balanced social 
accounting matrix (SAM) that provides a baseline characterization of the economy. The 
SAM contains data on the value of output in each sector, payments for factors of production 
                                                 
65 See Brooke, Kendrick, and Meeraus (1996) for a description of GAMS (http://www.gams.com/). 
66 Solving EMPAX-CGE as an MCP problem implies that complementary slackness is a feature of the 
equilibrium solution. In other words, any firm in operation will earn zero economic profits, and any unprofitable 
firms will cease operations. Similarly, for any commodity with a positive price, supply will equal demand, or 
conversely any good in excess supply will have a zero price. 
67 See Rutherford (1999) for MPSGE documentation (http://www.mpsge.org/). 
68 See http://www.implan.com/index.html for a description of the Minnesota IMPLAN Group and its data. 
69 These EIA sources include AEO 2007, the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, State Energy Data 
Report, State Energy Price and Expenditure Report, and various annual industry profiles.

281 
and intermediate inputs by each sector, household income and consumption, government 
purchases, investment, and trade flows. A balanced SAM for the baseline year consistent 
with the desired sectoral and regional aggregation is produced using procedures developed 
by Babiker and Rutherford (1997) and described in Rutherford and Paltsev (2000). This 
methodology relies on optimization techniques to maintain the calculated energy statistics (in 
both quantity and value terms) while minimizing any changes needed in the other economic 
data to create a new balanced SAM based on EIA/IMPLAN data for the baseline model year 
(in essence, industry production functions are adjusted, if necessary, to account for 
discrepancies between EIA energy data and IMPLAN economic data by matching the energy 
data and adjusting the use of nonenergy inputs so that the industry is in balance, that is, the 
value of inputs to production equals the value of output). 
These data are used to define economic conditions in 50 states within the United 
States (plus the District of Columbia), each of which contains 80 industries. Prior to solving 
EMPAX-CGE, the states and industries are aggregated up to the categories to be included in 
the analysis. Aggregated regions have been selected to capture important differences across 
the country in electricity generation technologies, while industry aggregations are controlled 
by available energy consumption data.  
Table 8-1 presents the 35 industry categories included in EMPAX-CGE for policy 
analysis. Their focus is on maintaining as much detail in the energy intensive and 
manufacturing sectors71 as is allowed by available energy consumption data and 
computational limits of dynamic CGE models. In addition, the electricity industry is 
separated into fossil fuel generation and nonfossil generation, which is necessary because 
many electricity policies affect only fossil-fired electricity. 
Figure 8-2 shows the five regions run in EMPAX-CGE in this analysis, which have 
been defined based on the expected regional distribution of policy impacts, availability of 
economic and energy data, and computational limits on model size. These regions have been 
constructed from the underlying state-level database designed to follow, as closely as

Assumptions for the Annual Energy Outlook 2007.

possible, the electricity market regions defined by the North American Electric Reliability 
Council (NERC).72  
8.1.2 Production Functions 
All productive markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive and have production 
technologies that exhibit constant returns to scale, except for the agriculture and natural 
resource extracting sectors, which have decreasing returns to scale because they use factors 
in fixed supply (land and fossil fuels, respectively). The electricity industry is separated into 
two distinct sectors: fossil fuel generation and nonfossil generation. This allows tracking of 
variables such as heat rates for fossil-fired utilities (in BTUs of energy input per kilowatt 
hour of electricity output). 
All markets must clear (i.e., supply must equal demand in every sector) in every 
period, and the income of each agent in the model must equal their factor endowments plus 
any net transfers. Along with the underlying data, the nesting structures shown in Figure 8-1 
and associated substitution elasticities define current production technologies and possible 
alternatives.
                                                 
72 Economic data and information on nonelectricity energy markets are generally available only at the state 
level, which necessitates an approximation of the NERC regions that follows state boundaries.

Figure 8-2. Regions Defined in Dynamic EMPAX-CGE 
 
 
8.1.3 Utility Functions 
Each region in the dynamic version of EMPAX-CGE contains four representative 
households, classified by income, that maximize intertemporal utility over all time periods in 
the model subject to budget constraints, where the income groups are  
▪ $0 to $14,999,  
▪ $15,000 to $29,999,  
▪ $30,000 to $49,999, and  
  
 
 
 
 
285 
▪ $50,000 and above.  
These representative households are endowed with factors of production, including 
labor, capital, natural resources, and land inputs to agricultural production. Factor prices are 
equal to the marginal revenue received by firms from employing an additional unit of labor 
or capital. The value of factors owned by each representative household depends on factor 
use implied by production within each region. Income from sales of these productive factors 
is allocated to purchases of consumption goods to maximize welfare. 
Within each time period, intratemporal utility received by a household is formed from 
consumption of goods and leisure. All consumption goods are combined using a Cobb-
Douglas structure to form an aggregate consumption good. This composite good is then 
combined with leisure time to produce household utility. The elasticity of substitution 
between consumption goods and leisure depends on empirical estimates of labor supply 
elasticities and indicates how willing households are to trade off leisure time for 
consumption. Over time, households consider the discounted present value of utility received 
from all periods’ consumption of goods and leisure. 
Following standard conventions of CGE models, factors of production are assumed to 
be mobile among sectors within regions, but migration of productive factors is not allowed 
across regions. This assumption is necessary to calculate welfare changes for the 
representative household located in each region in EMPAX-CGE. EMPAX-CGE also 
assumes that ownership of natural resources and capital embodied in nonfossil electricity 
generation are spread across the United States through capital markets. 
8.1.3.1 Welfare Measures 
To analyze the social benefits and costs of policy alternatives, EMPAX uses a 
willingness-to-pay measure known as a Hicksian equivalent variation (EV). EV reflects the 
additional money that a household would need (at original prices p0 and income m0) to make 
it as well off with the new policy; the amount is “equivalent” to the changes in the utility 
households receive from consumption and leisure time. 
  
 
 
 
 
286 
EV = u(p0; p′,m′) − u(p0; p0, m0) = u(p0; p′,m′) − m0 
where 
p0 = the baseline prices 
m0 = baseline income 
p′ = with policy prices 
m′ = with policy income 
For example, under a policy that makes households worse off, EV represents the maximum 
amount of money the household would be willing to pay to avoid the policy. Through this 
analysis, we use this metric to measure the policy’s social costs. It is important to emphasize 
the measure does not incorporate any environmental benefits associated with air quality 
improvements. 
8.1.4 Treatment of Trade 
In EMPAX-CGE, all goods and services are assumed to be composite, differentiated 
“Armington” goods made up of locally manufactured commodities and imported goods. 
Output of local industries is initially separated into output destined for local consumption by 
producers or households and output destined for export. This local output is then combined 
with goods from other regions in the United States using Armington trade elasticities that 
indicate agents make relatively little distinction between output from firms located within 
their region and output from firms in other regions within the United States. Finally, the 
domestic composite goods are aggregated with imports from foreign sources using lower 
trade elasticities to capture the fact that foreign imports are more differentiated from 
domestic output than are imports from other regional suppliers in the United States.  
8.1.5 Tax Rates and Distortions 
Taxes and associated distortions in economic behavior have been included in 
EMPAX-CGE because theoretical and empirical literature found that taxes can substantially 
alter estimated policy costs (e.g., Bovenberg and Goulder [1996]; Goulder and Williams 
  
 
 
 
 
287 
[2003]). For example, existing labor taxes distort economic choices because they encourage 
people to work below the levels they would choose in an economy without labor taxes and 
reduce economic efficiency.73 When environmental policies raise production costs for firms 
and the price of goods and services, people may choose to work even less; the additional 
economic costs from this decision have been described as the “tax interaction” effect.  
EMPAX-CGE considers these interaction effects by using tax data from several 
sources and by explicitly modeling household labor supply decisions. The IMPLAN 
economic database provides information on taxes such as indirect business taxes (all sales 
and excise taxes) and social security taxes. However, since IMPLAN reports factor payments 
for labor and capital at their gross of tax values, we use additional data sources to determine 
personal income and capital tax rates. Information from the TAXSIM model at the National 
Bureau of Economic Research (Feenberg and Coutts, 1993), along with user cost-of-capital 
calculations from Fullerton and Rogers (1993), are used to establish tax rates. Elasticity 
parameters describing labor supply choice ultimately determine how distortionary existing 
taxes are in the CGE model. EMPAX-CGE currently uses elasticities based on the relevant 
literature (i.e., 0.4 for the compensated labor supply elasticity and 0.15 for the 
uncompensated labor supply elasticity). These elasticity values give an overall marginal 
excess burden associated with the existing tax structure of approximately 0.3. 
8.1.6 Intertemporal Dynamics and Economic Growth 
EMPAX-CGE includes four sources of economic growth: technological change from 
improvements in energy efficiency, growth in the available labor supply (from both 
population growth and changes in labor productivity), increases in stocks of natural 
resources, and capital accumulation. Energy consumption per unit of output tends to decline 
over time because of improvements in production technologies and energy conservation. 
These changes in energy use per unit of output are modeled as autonomous energy efficiency 
improvements (AEEIs), which are used to replicate energy consumption forecasts by 
                                                 
73 These efficiency losses are often expressed in terms of overall marginal excess burden—the cost associated 
with raising an additional dollar of tax revenue. Estimates range from $0.10 to $0.35 per dollar (Ballard, 
Shoven, and Whalley, 1985). 
  
 
 
 
 
288 
industry and fuel from EIA.74 The AEEI values provide the means for matching expected 
trends in energy consumption that have been taken from the AEO forecasts. They alter the 
amount of energy needed to produce a given quantity of output by incorporating 
improvements in energy efficiency and conservation. Labor force and regional economic 
growth, electricity generation, changes in available natural resources, and resource prices are 
also based on the AEO forecasts. 
Savings provide the basis for capital formation and are motivated through people’s 
expectations about future needs for capital. Savings and investment decisions made by 
households determine aggregate capital stocks in EMPAX-CGE. The IMPLAN data set 
provides details on the types of goods and services used to produce the investment goods 
underlying each region’s capital stocks. Adjustment dynamics associated with formation of 
capital are controlled by using quadratic adjustment costs experienced when installing new 
capital, which imply that real costs are experienced to build and install new capital 
equipment. 
Prior to investigating policy scenarios, it is necessary to establish a baseline path for 
the economy that incorporates economic growth and technology changes that are expected to 
occur in the absence of the policy actions. Beginning from the initial balanced SAM data set, 
the model is calibrated to replicate forecasts from the AEO 2009 (Updated Reference Case 
Version, March 2009). Upon incorporating these forecasts, EMPAX-CGE is solved to 
generate a baseline based on them through 2030. Once this baseline is established, it is 
possible to run the “counterfactual” policy experiments discussed below. 
8.1.7 Linkage with the Integrated Planning Model 
Although CGE models have been used extensively to analyze climate policies that 
limit carbon emissions from electricity production, some other types of utility-emissions 
policies are more difficult to consider. Unlike carbon dioxide, emissions of pollutants such as 
SO2, NOx, and mercury are not necessarily proportional to fuel use. These types of emissions 
                                                 
74 See Babiker et al. (2001) for a discussion of how this methodology was used in the EPPA model (EPPA 
assumes that AEEI parameters are the same across all industries in a country, while AEEI values in 
EMPAX-CGE are industry specific). 
  
 
 
 
 
289 
can be lowered by a variety of methods, but a CGE model cannot adequately capture the 
boiler-specific nature of these decisions and their costs and effects. Combining the strengths 
of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) (disaggregated unit-level analyses of electricity 
policies) with the strengths of CGE models (macroeconomic effects of environmental 
policies) allows investigation of economy-wide implications of policies that would normally 
be hard to estimate consistently and effectively. IPM provides EMPAX with several 
electricity market outcomes needed to evaluate macroeconomic implications of policies.  
IPM also provides information on generation costs in terms of capital costs, fixed 
operating costs, and variable operating costs. For EMPAX to effectively incorporate these 
IPM data on changes in costs, they have to be expressed in terms of the productive inputs 
used in CGE models (i.e., capital, labor, and material inputs produced by other industries). 
Rather than assume these costs represent a proportional scaling up of all inputs to the 
electricity industry in EMPAX, we use Nestor and Pasurka (1995) data on purchases made 
by industries for environmental protection reasons to allocate these additional expenditures 
across inputs within EMPAX (discussed in the EMPAX model documentation). Once these 
expenditures are specified, the incremental costs from IPM can be used to adjust the 
production technologies and input purchases by electricity generation in the CGE model.  
 Among the many results provided by IPM, several can potentially have significant 
implications for the rest of the economy including changes in electricity prices, fuel 
consumption by utilities, fuel prices, and changes in electricity production expenditures.  
EMPAX is capable of simultaneously incorporating some of all of these IPM findings, 
depending on the desired type and degree of linkage between the two models.  At the 
regional level, EMPAX can match changes estimated by IPM for the following variables:  

electricity prices (percentage change in retail prices) 
 
coal and gas consumption for electricity (percentage changes in BTUs) 
 
coal and gas prices (percentage changes in prices) 
 
coal and gas expenditures ($ changes—BTUs of energy input times $/MMBTU) 
 
  
 
 
 
 
290 
capital costs ($ changes) 
 
fixed operating costs ($ changes) 
 
variable operating costs ($ changes) 
 
In addition, EMPAX-CGE can control electricity output to simulate the fixed demand 
used by IPM, or it can determine how changes in electricity prices will affect demand for 
electricity and hence electricity generation levels. 
The IPM model calculates these variables for 26 NERC subregions.  EMPAX uses 
information on generation levels for these subregions to aggregate the IPM results into the 
five regions used within EMPAX.  Wholesale electricity prices are then matched to the 
changes shown by IPM.  Fuel consumption by utilities in physical units (BTUs) is adjusted 
by the percentage changes in the IPM results.  Fuel prices paid by both industries and 
households are also changed by the amounts estimated by IPM (the coal and gas market 
modules of IPM cover all fuel consumers, not merely utilities, so prices paid by all agents in 
EMPAX are adjusted). 
 
8.1.8 Qualifications 
Caveats that can typically be applied to CGE analyses, including this one, cover 
issues such as transitional dynamics in the economy. CGE models such as EMPAX, which 
assume foresight on the part of businesses and households, will allow agents to adapt to 
anticipated policy impacts coming in the future. These adaptations may occur more quickly 
than if agents adopted a wait-and-see approach to new regulations. The alternative, recursive-
dynamic structure used in CGE models such as MIT EPPA imply that no anticipation or 
adjustments will occur until the policy is in place, which tends to overstate the costs of 
policies. 
In addition to transition dynamics, while CGE models are ideally suited for analyzing 
broad, economy-wide impacts of policies, they are not able to examine firm-specific impacts 
on profits/losses or estimate how policies might affect particular types of disadvantaged 
households. Similarly, environmental justice and other distributional concerns cannot be 
  
 
 
 
 
291 
adequately addressed using these types of models alone.   
As noted above, the labor supply elasticities in the model have been chosen from the 
CGE literature on labor markets and tax distortions as discussed above. Other important 
assumptions about the production technologies and input substitution possibilities have been 
chosen from the MIT EPPA model. To ensure transparence of the assumptions, 
EMPAX-CGE underwent peer review in 2006, and detailed model documentation and results 
of the peer review can be accessed at the following Web site: 
http://www.epa.gov/ttnecas1/EMPAXCGE.htm.  
8.2 EMPAX-CGE Model Results 
8.2.1 Macroeconomic Variables and Social Costs 
The transport rule will bring about changes in business and household behavior and 
will influence macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product [GDP] and consumption) 
and household economic welfare as estimated by the Hicksian EV method previously 
mentioned. Gross domestic product is the dollar value of all goods and services produced by 
the U.S. economy in a particular year.   Consumption is defined in this analysis as the dollar 
value of goods and services consumed in the U.S. in a particular year. In 2015, EMPAX 
estimates that GDP and consumption levels are approximately 0.01% lower ($1.6 billion) 
(Figure 8-3).75 Since the pollution controls vary by region, economic effects also vary by 
region; for example, Northeast GDP falls by 0.04% (Figure 8-4).  There are small declines in 
GDP by region except for the Plains and West, where regional GDP increases as productive 
activities shift to these less regulated regions. 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
75 We use 2015 estimates as a proxy for the impacts of compliance with the proposed rule in 2014.

GDP Consumption Hicksian EV (Annual)  
 
Note: GDP represents the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the US in 2015.  Consumption is the dollar 
value of all goods and services consumed within the US in 2015.  Hicksian EV is the change in household economic welfare 
(defined in Section 8.1.3.1). 
Average-annual social costs (as measured by Hicksian equivalent variation) are 
approximately 0.01% lower with the transport rule. Over the model’s time horizon, the total 
present value of the losses is approximately $21.3 billion.76 As noted in section 8.1.3.1 of this 
chapter, EMPAX-CGE does not incorporate any environmental benefits associated with air 
quality improvements. As a result, EMPAX welfare measures only approximate the rule’s 
social cost. Using this interpretation, the annual social cost for 2015 is estimated to be $2.2 
                                                 
76 Values are discounted back to 2010 at the 5% interest rate used in the model. EPA uses a 5% interest rate 
based on the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and SAB guidance from 2003 as 
discussed in U.S. EPA, Office of Policy Analysis and Review. 2003. “Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 
1990 - 2020: Revised Analytical Plan For EPA's Second Prospective Analysis.”  We recognize that this interest 
rate is not one of the interest rates (3 and 7%) that OMB’s Circular A-4 guidance calls for in regulatory 
analyses.  Detailed results for this EMPAX run for the proposed remedy can be found in the file 
“EMPAXresults_proposed transport remedy,” that is available in the docket for this rule.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
293 
billion.  With a 3 percent interest rate, the annual social cost for 2015 is estimated to be $2.0 
billion. 
8.2.2 Industry Effects 
The proposed rule directly influences the electricity sector’s fuel use and private cost 
expenditures. As the electricity sector responds to these changes, other economy-wide 
changes occur. For example, higher electricity prices may encourage electricity-dependent 
sectors to reduce production levels, switch to other energy sources (e.g., oil) and/or seek 
energy efficiency improvements in their production process. Electricity sectors also make 
additional private cost expenditures in order to comply with the transport rule; these 
expenditures lead to other economy-wide changes. For example each dollar spent to comply 
with the program is used to buy environmental protection goods and services.77 As a result, 
the demand for environmental protection goods and services will be higher with the transport 
rule. For sectors supplying environmental protection goods or services, the secondary effect 
may offset higher electricity costs. The following sections report and discuss output changes 
(i.e., changes in physical quantities of the goods/services each industry sector in each region 
produces) associated with the impacts of compliance in the year 2015, which serves as a 
proxy for compliance in 2014.

8.2.2.1 Energy Sectors 
The EMPAX modeling system shows that the electricity sector experiences the most 
significant changes under the transport rule. Electricity output and fuel mix changes used to 
meet the transport rule also influence other energy sectors. For example, U.S. electricity and 
coal output both decline by approximately 0.3%.  U.S. natural gas output changes for two 
reasons: 1) natural gas is used in electricity generation and electricity generation declines and 
2) natural gas is a substitute for electricity, so gas use increases when electricity becomes 
more expensive. Overall natural gas output declines because the first effect (reduced 
electricity generation) is greater than the second effect (substitution from electricity use to 
natural gas use)).  Crude oil and petroleum output decline, but the changes are small; these 
inputs are less critical to the electricity sector making them less sensitive to changes in 
electricity production (Figure 8-5). 
Given the regional distribution of controls, there are differences in regional output 
quantity changes. For example, electricity production in the Northeast experiences the largest 
decline while the Plains and West electricity sectors see small output increases. Coal output 
  
 
 
 
 
295 
changes to meet coal demand predictions from the IPM electricity model, and the IPM 
modeling system suggests that the Northeast’s electricity sector uses additional coal inputs to 
meet the rule’s requirements. 
8.2.2.2 Energy-Intensive Sectors 
Energy-intensive manufacturing industries are more sensitive to electricity and other 
energy price changes. Although the net U.S. output change for each energy-intensive 
industry is less than 0.1%, these sectors do show some (but economically small) regional 
variation. The most significant regional differences are seen in the aluminum sector, where 
production shifts from the Northeast, South, and Midwest regions to the Plains and West 
regions. Similar geographic shifts are observed in other energy-intensive industries 
(Figure 8-6). 
8.2.2.3 Nonenergy Sectors 
Although electricity expenditures represent a small fraction of nonenergy-sector 
production costs, higher electricity prices still influence nonenergy-sector production levels. 
However, nonenergy sector output effects are very small. National output levels for four 
broad nonenergy sectors: agriculture, other manufacturing, services, and transportation fall 
by less than one one-hundredth of a percent (0.01%). There is some regional variation as 
production shifts to areas with lower electricity costs (e.g., West, Plains), but the differences 
are not significant (Figure 8-7).

CHAPTER 9 
STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE ORDER IMPACT ANALYSES 
 
This chapter presents discussion and analyses relating to relevant Executive Orders 
and statutory requirements relevant for the Transport Rule.  We discuss potential impacts to 
affected small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as amended by 
the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA).  We also describe the 
analysis conducted to meet the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(UMRA) that assess the impact of the Transport Rule for state, local and Tribal governments 
and the private sector.  Analyses conducted to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA) are also discussed.  In addition, we address the requirements of Executive Order (EO) 
13045:  Protection of Children from Environmental Health and Safety Risks; EO 13175:  
Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments; and EO 12898:  Federal 
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income 
Populations.  The Discussion of Executive Order 13211:  Actions that Significantly Affect 
Energy Supply, Distribution or Use is provided in Chapter 7 of this RIA.   
 
9.1 Small Entity Impacts 
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. ' 601 et seq.), as amended by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law No. 104-121), provides that 
whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must 
prepare and make available an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, unless it certifies that the 
proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have Aa significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities@ (5 U.S.C. ' 605[b]).  Small entities include small businesses, small 
organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.   
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the Transport Rule on small entities, a 
small entity is defined as: 
(1) A small business according to the Small Business Administration size 
standards by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
category of the owning entity.  The range of small business size standards for 
  
 
 
 
 
303 
electric utilities is 4 billion kilowatt-hours of production or less; 
(2) a small government jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, 
district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and 
(3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently 
owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.   
Table 9-1 lists entities potentially affected by this proposed rule with the applicable 
NAICS code.

EPA examined the potential economic impacts to small entities associated with this 
rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected entities will implement control 
measures to meet their NOx and SO2 budgets.  This analysis does not examine potential 
indirect economic impacts associated with the Transport Rule, such as employment effects in 
industries providing fuel and pollution control equipment, or the potential effects of

electricity price increases on industries and households.     
 
9.1.1 Identification of Small Entities 
 EPA used Velocity Suite’s Ventyx data as a basis for identifying plant ownership and 
compiling the list of potentially affected small entities.78  The data set contains detailed 
ownership and corporate affiliation information.  For plants burning fossil fuel as the primary 
fuel, plant-level boiler and generator capacity, heat input, generation, and emissions data 
were aggregated by owner and then parent company.  Entities with more than 4 billion kWh 
of annual electricity generation were removed from the list, as were municipal-owned 
entities serving a population greater than 50,000.  Finally, for cooperatives, investor-owned 
utilities, and subdivisions that generate less than 4 billion kWh of electricity annually but 
may be part of a large entity, additional research on power sales, operating revenues, and 
other business activities was performed to make a final determination regarding size.  
Because the rule does not affect units with a generating capacity of less than 25 MW, small 
entities that do not own at least one generating unit with a capacity greater than or equal to 
25 MW were dropped from the data set.  According to EPA’s analysis, nearly 600 small 
entities were exempted by this provision.  Finally, small entities for which IPM does not 
project generation in 2014 in the base case were omitted from the analysis because they are 
not projected to be operating and thus will not face the costs of compliance with the 
Transport Rule.  After omitting entities for the reasons above, EPA identified a total of 81 
potentially affected small entities, out of a possible 760.79  The number of potentially 
affected small entities by ownership type is listed in Table 9-2.   
 
9.1.2 Overview of Analysis and Results 
 This section presents the methodology and results for estimating the impact on the 
Transport Rule to small entities in 2014 based on the following endpoints:

would apply to financial or industrial companies and found that they did not meet the definitions of small 
entities in this context.

 ratio of small entity impacts to revenues from electricity generation. 
9.1.2.1 Methodology for Estimating Impacts of the Transport Rule on Small Entities 
 An entity can comply with the Transport Rule through some combination of the 
following: installing retrofit technologies, purchasing allowances, switching to a cleaner fuel, 
or reducing emissions through a reduction in generation or improved efficiency.  
Additionally, units with more allowances than needed can sell these allowances in the 
market.  The chosen compliance strategy will be primarily a function of the unit’s marginal 
control costs and its position relative to the marginal control costs of other units. 
To attempt to account for each potential control strategy, EPA estimates compliance 
costs as follows: 
 CCompliance = Δ COperating+Retrofit + Δ CFuel + Δ CAllowances + Δ CTransaction + Δ R  
where C represents a component of cost as labeled, and Δ R represents the value of foregone 
electricity generation, calculated as the difference in revenues between the base case and the 
Transport Rule.    
In reality, compliance choices and market conditions can combine such that an entity 
may actually experience a savings in any of the individual components of cost.  Under the 
Transport Rule, some units will forgo some level of electricity generation (and thus 
revenues) to comply and this impact will be lessened on these entities by the projected 
increase in electricity prices under the Transport Rule. On the other hand, those increasing 
generation levels will see an increase in electricity revenues and as a result, lower net 
compliance costs. If entities are able to increase revenue more than an increase in fuel cost 
and other operating costs, ultimately they will have negative net compliance costs (or 
savings).  Elsewhere, units burning high or medium sulfur coal might decide to pay relatively 
more for low-sulfur coal under the Transport Rule and sell allowances on the market, in the 
hopes of negating some or all of their compliance cost.  Overall, small entities are not 
projected to install relatively costly emissions control retrofits, but may choose to do so in 
some instances.  Because this analysis evaluates the total costs along each of the compliance 
strategies laid out above for each entity, it inevitably captures savings or gains such as those 
  
 
 
 
 
306 
described.  As a result, what we describe as cost is really more of a measure of the net 
economic impact of the rule on small entities. 
For this analysis, EPA used IPM-parsed output to estimate costs based on the 
parameters above, at the unit level.  These impacts were then summed for each small entity, 
adjusting for ownership share.  Net impact estimates were based on the following:  operating 
and retrofit costs, sale or purchase of allowances, and the change in fuel costs or electricity 
generation revenues under the Transport Rule relative to the base case.  These individual 
components of compliance cost were estimated as follows: 
(1) Operating and retrofit costs:  Using the IPM-parsed output for the base case 
and the Transport Rule, EPA identified units that install control technology 
under the Transport Rule and the technology installed.  The equations for 
calculating retrofit costs were adopted from EPA’s version of IPM.  The 
model calculates the capital cost (in $/MW); the fixed operation and 
maintenance (O&M) cost (in $/MW-year); the variable O&M cost (in 
$/MWh); and the total annualized retrofit cost for units projected to install 
FGD, SCR, or SNCR.   
(2) Sale or purchase of allowances:  EPA estimated the value of initial SO2 and 
NOx annual and NOx ozone season allowance holdings.  For both SO2 and 
NOx, the state emission budgets were assumed to be apportioned to units 
based on their share of the state's total emissions.  EPA calculated each unit's 
SO2 and NOx annual and NOx ozone season allowance allocations as the ratio 
of that unit's adjusted emissions (as determined in the state budget calculation 
methodology) to the sum of all units' emissions in the applicable state, times 
the final state budget.  Thus each unit's allocation is the unit's proportional 
share of the state budget, based on emissions as determined in the state budget 
calculation.  See State Budgets, Unit Allocations, and Unit Emissions Rates 
TSD. 
To estimate the value of allowances holdings, allocated allowances were 
subtracted from projected emissions, and the difference was then multiplied 
by the allowance prices projected by IPM for 2014.  Units were assumed to 
purchase or sell allowances to exactly cover their projected emissions under 
the Transport Rule.  
(3) Fuel costs:  Fuel costs were estimated by multiplying fuel input (MMBtu) by 
region and fuel-type-adjusted fuel prices ($/MMBtu) from IPM.  The change 
in fuel expenditures under the Transport Rule was then estimated by taking 
  
 
 
 
 
307 
the difference in fuel costs between the Transport Rule and the base case.   
(4) Value of electricity generated:  EPA estimated electricity generation by first 
estimating unit capacity factor and maximum fuel capacity.  Unit capacity 
factor is estimated by dividing fuel input (MMBtu) by maximum fuel capacity 
(MMBtu).  The maximum fuel capacity was estimated by multiplying 
capacity (MW) * 8,760 operating hours * heat rate (MMBtu/MWh).  The 
value of electricity generated is then estimated by multiplying capacity (MW) 
* capacity factor * 8,760 * regional-adjusted retail electricity price ($/MWh), 
for all entities except those categorized as “Private” in Ventyx.  For private 
entities, EPA used wholesale electricity price instead retail electricity price 
because most of the private entities are independent power producers (IPP). 
IPPs sell their electricity to wholesale purchasers and do not own transmission 
facilities and thus their revenue was estimated with wholesale electricity 
prices.   
As discussed later in this analysis, 75 percent of small entities projected to be 
affected by the Transport Rule do not have to operate in a competitive market 
environment and thus should be able to pass compliance costs on to 
consumers.  We defined cost of service regions as regions with a deregulation 
percentage of less than 20 percent. The deregulation percentage is defined for 
this analysis as a percentage estimating the degree of competition in 
electricity market, as provided by EIA.  The lower this percentage means that 
there are more areas with cost of service market characteristics. We have used 
the estimates published in AEO 2009. 
To somewhat account for this cost pass-through, we incorporated the 
projected regional-adjusted retail electricity price calculated under the 
Transport Rule in our estimation of generation revenue under the Transport 
Rule.   
(5) Administrative costs:  Because most affected units are already monitored as 
a result of other regulatory requirements, EPA considered the primary 
administrative cost to be transaction costs related to purchasing or selling 
allowances.  EPA assumed that transaction costs were equal to 1.5 percent of 
the total absolute value of a unit’s allowances.  This assumption is based on 
market research by ICF International.   
 
9.1.2.2 Results 
 The potential impacts of the Transport Rule on small entities are summarized in Table 
9-2.  All costs are presented in $2006.  EPA estimated the annualized net compliance cost to 
  
 
 
 
 
308 
small entities to be approximately - $35.9 million in 2014 or savings of $35.9 million.80 The 
fact that the net compliance costs for all entities are actually net savings does not mean that 
each small entity would benefit from the Transport Rule. The net savings are driven by a few 
entities that are able to increase their revenues by increasing generation and taking advantage 
of higher electricity prices.

costs.  A negative cost value implies that the group of entities experiences a net savings under the 
Transport Rule.

80 Neither the costs nor the revenues of units that retire under the Transport Rule are included in the impact 
estimates.  Because these units are better off retiring under the Transport Rule than continuing operation, the 
true cost of the rule on these units is not represented by our modeling.  The true cost of the Transport Rule for 
these units is the differential between their costs in the base case and the costs of meeting their customers’ 
demand under the rule.   
  
 
 
 
 
309 
EPA assessed the economic and financial impacts of the rule using the ratio of 
compliance costs to the value of revenues from electricity generation, focusing in particular 
on entities for which this measure is greater than 1 percent.  Although this metric is 
commonly used in EPA impact analyses, it makes the most sense when as a general matter an 
analysis is looking at small businesses that operate in competitive environments.  However, 
small businesses in the electric power industry often operate in a price-regulated environment 
where they are able to recover expenses through rate increases.  Given this, EPA considers 
the 1 percent measure in this case a crude measure of the price increases these small entities 
will be asking of rate commissions or making at publicly owned companies.   
Of the 81 small entities considered in this analysis, 30 entities may experience 
compliance costs greater than 1 percent of generation revenues in 2014.  Entities that 
experience negative net costs under the Transport Rule are excluded from these totals.  These 
results do not fully account for the reality that about three-quarters of these entities operate in 
cost of service markets and thus should be able to recover all of their costs of complying with 
the Transport Rule.  Furthermore, of the approximately 550 units identified by EPA as being 
potentially owned by small entities, approximately two-thirds of the units that have higher 
costs are not expected to make operational changes as a result of this rule (e.g. install control 
equipment or switch fuels).  Their increased costs are largely due to increased cost of the fuel 
they would be expected to use whether or not they had to comply with the proposed rule.  
Increased fuel costs are often passed through to rate-payers as common practice in many 
areas of the U.S. due to fuel adder arrangements instituted by state public utility 
commissions. Finally, EPA’s decision to exclude units smaller than 25 MW has already 
significantly reduced the burden on small entities by nearly 600.  Hence, EPA has concluded 
that there is no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (No 
SISNOSE) for this rule.  The number of entities with compliance costs exceeding 3 percent 
of generation revenues is also included in Table 9-2.   
The distribution across entities of economic impacts as a share of base case revenue is 
summarized in Table 9-3.  Although the distributions of economic impacts on each 
ownership type are in general fairly tight, there are a few outliers for which the percentage of 
economic impacts as a share of revenue is either very low or very high relative to the 
capacity-weighted average.  In the cases where entities are projected to experience negative 
  
 
 
 
 
310 
net impacts that are a high percentage of revenues, these entities have units that are able to 
increase generation with the Transport Rule, thus increasing revenues.  In the cases where 
entities are projected to experience positive net impacts that are a high percentage of 
revenues, these entities do not find it economic to retrofit and are unable to switch to a lower 
sulfur coal. Thus, another reason for entities incurring impacts is that they are expected to 
reduce their generation under the Transport Rule which reduces revenues collected from 
electricity sales and inflates net costs.

The separate components of annualized costs to small entities under the Transport 
Rule are summarized in Table 9-4.  The most significant components of incremental cost to 
these entities under the Transport Rule are due to lower electricity revenues and increased 
fuel costs.  Fuel costs increase over all ownership groups except the ones under the 
ownership type “Private” because an entity with the second largest generation under 
“Private” is projected to cut its generation by 25 percent under the Transport Rule, which 
translates to lower fuel costs for the whole group.  Additionally, increases in electricity 
generation revenue, shown as cost savings or negative costs are experienced by cooperative, 
investor-owned utility, municipal and subdivision entities.  This is due largely to the 
projected increase in electricity prices under the Transport Rule. Among the private category, 
however, reduced generation by the one entity with a large share of generation leads to 
higher net costs for the entire category. Our data suggests this entity owns a group of 
combined cycle units and which are presumably marginal units in their respective load 
segments under the base case.

Furthermore, 26 MW of total small entity capacity, or 0.04 percent of total small 
entity capacity in the Transport Rule region, is projected to be uneconomic to maintain under 
the Transport Rule relative to the base case.  To put these numbers in context, of all affected 
  
 
 
 
 
312 
capacity under the Transport Rule, about 1.9 GW (0.5 percent) of coal-fired capacity is 
projected to be uneconomic to maintain relative to the base case.  This comparison suggests 
that small entities should not be disproportionately affected by the Transport Rule.  In 
practice, units projected to be uneconomic to maintain may be mothballed, retired, or kept in 
service to ensure transmission reliability in certain parts of the grid.  Our IPM modeling is 
unable to distinguish between these potential outcomes.   
9.1.3 Summary of Small Entity Impacts 
 EPA examined the potential economic impacts to small entities associated with this 
rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected states will implement control measures 
to meet their emissions.  To summarize, of the 81 small entities potentially affected, and the 
760 small entities in the Transport Rule region that are included in EPA’s modeling, 30 may 
experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues in 2014, based on 
assumptions of how the affected states implement control measures to meet their emissions 
budgets as set forth in this rulemaking.  Potentially affected small entities experiencing 
compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues have some potential for significant 
impact resulting from implementation of the Transport Rule.  However, as noted above, it is 
EPA’s position that because very few of the affected entities currently operate in a 
competitive market environment, they should generally be able to pass the costs of 
complying with the Transport Rule on to rate-payers.  Furthermore, the decision to include 
only units greater than 25 MW in size exempts around 600 small entities that would 
otherwise be potentially affected by the Transport Rule.   
 
9.2 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) Analysis 
 Title II of the UMRA of 1995 (Public Law 104-4)(UMRA) establishes requirements 
for federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on state, local, and Tribal 
governments and the private sector.  Under Section 202 of the UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1532, EPA 
generally must prepare a written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for any 
proposed or final rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure 
by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100,000,000 or more ... in any one year.  A Federal mandate is defined under Section 
421(6), 2 U.S.C. 658(6), to include a Federal intergovernmental mandate and a Federal 
  
 
 
 
 
313 
private sector mandate.  A Federal intergovernmental mandate, in turn, is defined to include 
a regulation that would impose an enforceable duty upon State, Local, or Tribal 
governments, Section 421(5)(A)(i), 2 U.S.C. 658(5)(A)(i), except for, among other things, a 
duty that is a condition of Federal assistance, Section 421(5)(A)(i)(I).  A Federal private 
sector mandate includes a regulation that would impose an enforceable duty upon the private 
sector, with certain exceptions, Section 421(7)(A), 2 U.S.C. 658(7)(A). 
Before promulgating an EPA rule for which a written statement is needed under 
Section 202 of the UMRA, Section 205, 2 U.S.C. 1535, of the UMRA generally requires 
EPA to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt the 
least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives 
of the rule. EPA included descriptions of three remedy options that it considered when 
developing its proposed rule: (1) the proposed remedy of State Budgets/Limited Trading, (2) 
State Budgets/Intrastate Trading, and (3) Direct Controls. Moreover, section 205 allows EPA 
to adopt an alternative other than the least costly, most cost-effective or least burdensome 
alternative if the Administrator publishes with the final rule an explanation why that 
alternative was not adopted. 
Furthermore, as EPA stated in the proposal, EPA is not directly establishing any 
regulatory requirements that may significantly or uniquely affect small governments, 
including Tribal governments.  Thus, under the proposed Transport Rule, EPA is not 
obligated to develop under Section 203 of the UMRA a small government agency plan. 
EPA analyzed the economic impacts of the Transport Rule on government entities.  
This analysis does not examine potential indirect economic impacts associated with the 
Transport Rule, such as employment effects in industries providing fuel and pollution control 
equipment, or the potential effects of electricity price increases on industries and households.  
9.2.1 Identification of Government-Owned Entities 
 Using Ventyx data, EPA identified state- and municipality-owned utilities and 
subdivisions in the Transport Rule region.  EPA then used IPM-parsed output to associate 
these plants with individual generating units.  Entities that did not own at least one unit with 
a generating capacity of greater than 25 MW were omitted from the analysis because of their 
  
 
 
 
 
314 
exemption from the rule.  This exempts 380 entities owned by state or local governments.  
Additionally, government-owned entities for which IPM does not project generation in 2014 
under the base case or the Transport Rule were exempted from this analysis, because they are 
not projected to be operating and thus will not face the costs of compliance with the 
Transport Rule. Twenty-five entities were dropped from the analysis for this reason.  Out of 
the 380 and 25 dropped entities, 7 of them are both less than 25 MW and not projected to 
operate in 2014.  Thus, EPA identified 84 state and municipality-owned utilities that are 
potentially affected by the Transport Rule, out of a possible 482, which are summarized in 
Table 9-5.   
9.2.2 Overview of Analysis and Results 
 After identifying potentially affected government entities, EPA estimated the impact 
of the Transport Rule in 2014 based on the following: 
 total impacts of compliance on government entities and 
 ratio of government entity impacts to revenues from electricity generation. 
The financial burden to owners of EGUs under the Transport Rule is composed of 
compliance and administrative costs.  This section outlines the compliance and 
administrative costs for the 84 potentially affected government-owned units in the Transport 
Rule region.   
9.2.2.1 Methodology for Estimating Impacts of the Transport Rule on Government Entities 
 The primary burden on state and municipal governments that operate utilities under 
the Transport Rule is the cost of installing control technology on units to meet SO2 and NOx 
emission limits or the cost of purchasing allowances.  However, an entity can comply with 
the Transport Rule through any combination of the following:  installing retrofit 
technologies, purchasing allowances, switching to a cleaner fuel, or reducing emissions 
through a reduction in generation.  Additionally, units with more allowances than needed can 
sell these allowances on the market.  The chosen compliance strategy will be primarily a 
function of the unit’s marginal control costs and its position relative to the marginal control 
costs of other units.   
  
 
 
 
 
315 
To attempt to account for each potential control strategy, EPA estimates compliance 
costs as follows: 
 CCompliance = Δ COperating+Retrofit + Δ CFuel + Δ CAllowances + Δ CTransaction + Δ R  
where C represents a component of cost as labeled, and Δ R represents the retail value of 
foregone electricity generation.   
In reality, compliance choices and market conditions can combine such that an entity 
may actually experience a savings in any of the individual components of cost.  Under the 
Transport Rule, for example, some units will forgo some level of electricity generation (and 
thus revenues) to comply, this impact will be lessened on these entities by the projected 
increase in electricity prices under the Transport Rule, while those not reducing generation 
levels will see an increase in electricity revenues. Because this analysis evaluates the total 
costs along each of the four compliance strategies laid out above for each entity, it inevitably 
captures savings or gains such as those described.  As a result, what we describe as cost is 
really more of a measure of the net economic impact of the rule on small entities. 
In this analysis, EPA used IPM-parsed output for the base case and the Transport 
Rule to estimate compliance cost at the unit level. These costs were then summed for each 
small entity, adjusting for ownership share.  Compliance cost estimates were based on the 
following:  operating and retrofit costs, sale or purchase of allowances, and the change in 
fuel costs or electricity generation revenues under the Transport Rule relative to the base 
case.  These components of compliance cost were estimated as follows: 
(1) Retrofit and operating costs:  Using the IPM-parsed output for the base case 
and the Transport Rule, EPA identified units that install control technology 
under the Transport Rule and the technology installed.  The equations for 
calculating retrofit costs for SCR, SNCR, and FGD were adopted from EPA’s 
TRUM.  The model calculates the capital cost (in $/MW), the fixed O&M 
cost (in $/MW-year), the variable O&M cost (in $/MWh), and the total 
annualized retrofit and operating cost by unit.  
(2) Sale or purchase of allowances:  EPA estimated the value of initial SO2 and 
NOx annual and NOx ozone season allowance holdings.  For both SO2 and 
NOx, the state emission budgets were assumed to be apportioned to units 
based on their share of the state's total emissions.  EPA calculated each unit's 
  
 
 
 
 
316 
SO2 and NOx annual and NOx ozone season allowance allocations as the ratio 
of that unit's adjusted emissions (as determined in the state budget calculation 
methodology) to the sum of all units' emissions in the applicable state, times 
the final state budget.  Thus each unit's allocation is the unit's proportional 
share of the state budget, based on emissions as determined in the state budget 
calculation.  See State Budgets, Unit Allocations, and Unit Emissions Rates 
TSD. 
To estimate the value of allowances holdings, allocated allowances were 
subtracted from projected emissions, and the difference was then multiplied 
by the allowance price projected by IPM.  Units were assumed to purchase or 
sell allowances to exactly cover their projected emissions under the Transport 
Rule.   
(3) Fuel costs:  Fuel costs were estimated by multiplying fuel input (MMBtu) by 
region and fuel type-adjusted fuel prices ($/MMBtu) from TRUM.  The 
change in fuel expenditures under the Transport Rule was then estimated by 
taking the difference in fuel costs between the Transport Rule and the base 
case.   
(4) Value of electricity generated:  EPA estimated electricity generation by first 
estimating the unit capacity factor and maximum fuel capacity.  The unit 
capacity factor is estimated by dividing fuel input (MMBtu) by maximum fuel 
capacity (MMBtu).  The maximum fuel capacity was estimated by 
multiplying capacity (MW) * 8,760 operating hours * heat rate 
(MMBtu/MWh).  The value of electricity generated was then estimated by 
multiplying capacity (MW) * capacity factor * 8,760 * regional-adjusted retail 
electricity price ($/MWh).   
(5) Administrative costs:  Because most affected units are already monitored as 
a result of other regulatory requirements, EPA considered the primary 
administrative cost to be transaction costs related to purchasing or selling 
allowances.  EPA assumed that transaction costs were equal to 1.5 percent of 
the total absolute value of a unit’s allowances.  This assumption is based on 
market research by ICF International.

As was done for the small entities analysis, EPA further assessed the economic and 
financial impacts of the rule using the ratio of compliance costs to the value of revenues from 
electricity generation in the base case, also focusing specifically on entities for which this 
measure is greater than 1 percent.82  EPA projects that 27 government entities will have 
                                                 
81All costs are reported in 2006 dollars.   
82Neither the costs nor the revenues of units that retire under the Transport Rule are included in this portion of 
the analysis.  Because these units are better off retiring under the Transport Rule than continuing operation, the 
true cost of the rule on these units is not represented by our modeling.  The true cost of the Transport Rule for 
these units is the differential between their costs in the base case and the costs of meeting their customers’ 
demand under the rule.   
  
 
 
 
 
318 
compliance costs greater than 1 percent of revenues from electricity generation in 2014.  
Also similar to the small entity analysis, the majority of the units that have higher costs are 
not expected to make operational changes as a result of this rule (e.g., install control 
equipment or switch fuels).  Their increased costs are largely due to increased cost of the fuel 
they would be expected to use whether or not they had to comply with the proposed rule.  
Further, increased fuel costs are often passed through to rate-payers as common practice in 
many areas of the U.S. due to fuel adder arrangements instituted by state public utility 
commissions. Entities that are projected to experience negative compliance costs under the 
Transport Rule are not included in those totals.  This approach is more indicative of a 
significant impact when an analysis is looking at entities operating in a competitive market 
environment.  Government-owned entities do not operate in a competitive market 
environment and therefore will be able to recover expenses under the Transport Rule through 
rate increases.  Given this, EPA considers the 1 percent measure in this case a crude measure 
of the extent to which rate increases will be made at publicly owned companies.   
The distribution across entities of economic impacts as a share of base case revenue is 
summarized in Table 9-6.  For municipality-owned entities and subdivisions, the maximum 
economic impact as a share of base case revenues is approximately 50.5 and 2.5 percent, 
respectively.  A few municipality-owned entities experience economic impacts that are 
significantly higher than the capacity-weighted average for this group.  In the cases where 
entities are projected to experience positive net costs that are a high percentage of revenues, 
these entities do not find it economic to retrofit and are unable to switch to a lower-sulfur 
coal.  Thus, another reason for entities incurring impacts is that they are expected to reduce 
their generation under the Transport Rule which reduces revenues collected from electricity 
sales and inflates net costs.

Additionally, a few entities are projected to experience negative net costs that are a 
high percentage of base case revenues.  These entities have units that are able to increase 
generation levels, thus increasing revenues.  Additionally, entities in regions for which we 
project large electricity price increases relative to other regions tend to be among those at the 
lower end of the distribution. 
The various components of annualized incremental cost under the Transport Rule to 
each group of government entities are summarized in Table 9-7.  In 2014, subdivisions are a 
net purchaser of allowances, while states and municipalities sell allowances.  Additionally, 
each group experiences both an increase in fuel expenditures and an increase in electricity 
revenue under the Transport Rule.  Incremental fuel costs are positive because these entities 
are projected to increase generation and face higher fuel prices.  Overall, increases in total 
electricity revenue by government entities under the Transport Rule exceed the increases in 
fuel and operating costs.

Source: ICF International analysis based on IPM analysis 
IPM modeling of the Transport Rule projects that approximately 60 MW (2 units of 
347 in this analysis) of municipality-owned capacity would be uneconomic to maintain under 
the Transport Rule, beyond what is projected in the base case.  This represents about 0.1 
percent of all subdivision, state, and municipality capacity in the Transport Rule region.  For 
comparison, overall affected capacity under the Transport Rule, about 1.9 GW, or 0.5 percent 
of all coal-fired capacity is projected to be uneconomic to maintain relative to the base case.  
This comparison suggests that government entities should not face a disproportionate burden 
under the Transport Rule.  In practice, units projected to be uneconomic to maintain may be 
“mothballed,” retired, or kept in service to ensure transmission reliability in certain parts of 
the grid.  Our IPM modeling is unable to distinguish between these potential outcomes. 
9.2.3 Summary of Government Entity Impacts 
 EPA examined the potential economic impacts on state and municipality-owned 
entities associated with this rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected states will 
implement control measures to meet their emissions.  According to EPA’s analysis, the total 
net economic impact on government-owned entities is expected to be over -$15 million in 
2014 or a net savings of more than $15 million. This does not mean that each government 
entity will experience net savings as the overall net savings is driven by several entities 
garnering large savings. Of the 84 government entities considered in this analysis and the 
482 government entities in the Transport Rule region that are included in EPA’s modeling, 
27 may experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues in 2014, based on our 
  
 
 
 
 
321 
assumptions of how the affected states implement control measures to meet their emissions 
budgets as set forth in this rulemaking. 
Government entities projected to experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent 
of revenues have some potential for significant impact resulting from implementation of the 
Transport Rule.  However, as noted above, it is EPA’s position that because these 
government entities can pass on their costs of compliance to rate-payers, they will not be 
significantly affected.  Furthermore, the decision to include only units greater than 25 MW in 
size exempts 380 government entities that would otherwise be potentially affected by the 
Transport Rule.   
 
9.3 Paperwork Reduction Act 
 In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), EPA 
submitted a proposed Information Collection Request (ICR) (EPA ICR number 2512.01) to 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval on July 19, 2004 
(FR 42720-42722).  The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its 
estimated burden and cost associated with the final rule.  In cases where information is 
already collected by a related program, the ICR takes into account only the additional 
burden.  This situation arises in states that are also subject to requirements of the 
Consolidated Emissions Reporting Rule (EPA ICR number 0916.10; OMB control number 
2060-0088) or for sources that are subject to the Acid Rain Program (EPA ICR number 
1633.13; OMB control number 2060-0258) or NOx SIP Call (EPA ICR number 1857.03; 
OMB number 2060-0445) requirements. 
EPA solicited comments on specific aspects of the information collection.  The 
purpose of the ICR is to estimate the anticipated monitoring, reporting, and record-keeping 
burden estimates and associated costs for states, local governments, and sources that are 
expected to result from the Transport Rule. 
The record-keeping and reporting burden to sources resulting from states choosing to 
participate in a regional cap-and-trade program is approximately $28 million annually.  This 
estimate includes the annualized cost of installing and operating appropriate SO2 and NOx 
  
 
 
 
 
322 
emissions monitoring equipment to measure and report the total emissions of these pollutants 
from affected EGUs (serving generators greater than 25 megawatts capacity).  The burden to 
state and local air agencies includes any necessary SIP revisions, performance of monitoring 
certification, and fulfilling of audit responsibilities.  More information on the ICR analysis is 
included in the official the Transport Rule docket. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act on July 19, 2004, an ICR was made 
available to the public for comment.  The 60-day comment period expired September 19, 
2004, with no public comments received specific to the ICR. 
 
9.4    Environmental Justice 
            Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes federal 
executive policy on environmental justice.  Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the 
greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their 
mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority 
populations and low-income populations in the United States.   
9.4.1. Consideration of Environmental Justice Issues in the Rule Development Process 
In the rulemaking process EPA considers whether there are positive or negative 
impacts of the action that appear to affect low-income, minority, or Tribal communities 
disproportionately, and, regardless of whether a disproportionate effect exists, whether there 
is a chance for these communities to meaningfully participate in the rulemaking process. 
EPA expects that this rule “Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of 
Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone” will provide significant health and environmental 
benefits to, among others, people with asthma, people with heart disease, and people living in 
ozone or fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment areas. This rule also has the potential to affect 
the cost structure of the utility industry and could lead to regional shifts in electricity 
generation and/or emissions of various pollutants. Therefore we expect this rule to be of 
interest to many environmental justice communities. EPA’s analysis of the effects of this 
proposed rule, including information on air quality changes and the resulting health benefits, 
  
 
 
 
 
323 
is presented both in section IX of the preamble and in more detail in the air quality modeling 
Technical Support Document and chapters 3 and 4 of this Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). 
These documents can be accessed through the rule docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0491 
and from the main EPA webpage for the rule www.epa.gov/airtransport. This section 
summarizes the legal basis for this rule, and provides background information on how this 
rule fits into the larger regulatory strategy for controlling pollution from the power sector. A 
summary of the emissions, air quality, and health benefit estimates for this rule then follows. 
This rule is replacing an earlier rule (the 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)) that 
was first vacated and then remanded to EPA by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. CAIR was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit in July 2008 in a case known as North Carolina v EPA. In December 2008, 
the vacatur was altered to a remand based on the likely environmental harms of vacating the 
rule and EPA’s stated intent to replace the rule promptly. At the time of the 2008 court 
ruling, many sources had already begun to install and run emissions control devices or 
otherwise alter their operations and had successfully begun reducing their emissions. The 
court decision has led to significant uncertainty among affected sources as to what emission 
reductions will be required and among states and communities as to what air quality benefits 
will be achieved. By proposing this aggressive replacement rule that meets the legal 
requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as interpreted by the Court in the North Carolina 
decision promptly, EPA is both maximizing the likelihood that the goals of the CAA will be 
met, and helping communities receive the air quality benefits they need as quickly as 
possible by minimizing the chance that any emission reductions achieved under CAIR would 
be lost. 
It is important to note that CAA § 110(a)(2)(d), which addresses transport of criteria 
pollutants between states and is the authority for this rule, is only one of many provisions of 
the CAA that provide EPA, states, and local governments with authorities to reduce exposure 
to ozone and PM2.5 in communities. These legal authorities work together to reduce exposure 
to these pollutants in communities, including environmental justice communities, and 
provide substantial health benefits to both the general public and sensitive sub-populations.  
  
 
 
 
 
324 
 
9.4.2. Potential Environmental and Public Health Impacts to Vulnerable Populations 
There are several considerations to take into account when assessing the effects of 
this proposed rule on minority, low-income, and Tribal populations. These include: amount 
of emissions reductions and where they take place (including any potential for areas of 
increased emissions); the changes in ambient concentrations across the affected area; and the 
health benefits expected from the rules. 
Emission reductions. This proposed rule will reduce exposure to PM2.5 and ozone 
pollution in most eastern states by reducing interstate transport of these pollutants and their 
chemical precursors (sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)). This rule has the 
effect of reducing emissions of these pollutants that affect the most-contaminated areas (i.e. 
areas that are not meeting the 1997 and 2006 ozone and PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS)). This rule separately identifies both nonattainment areas and 
maintenance areas (maintenance areas are those that currently meet the NAAQS but that, 
based on past data, are in danger of exceeding the standards in the future). This approach of 
requiring emission reductions to protect maintenance areas as well as nonattainment areas 
reduces the likelihood that any areas close to the level of the standard will exceed the current 
health-based standards in the future.  
Ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in both nonattainment and maintenance areas 
identified in this rule are the result of both local emissions and long-range transport of 
pollution.  This rule requires upwind states to reduce or eliminate their significant 
contribution to nonattainment or maintenance problems in downwind states.  Even when the 
significant contributions of upwind states are fully eliminated, additional emissions 
reductions within the nonattainment area and/or the downwind state will be needed for some 
areas to attain and maintain the NAAQS.  
The proposed remedy option for this rule would use a limited emissions trading 
mechanism among power plants to achieve significant emission reductions in states covered 
by the rule. EPA recognizes that many environmental justice communities have voiced 
concerns about emissions trading and any resulting potential for any emissions increases in 
  
 
 
 
 
325 
any location.  
The proposed rule uses EPA’s authority in CAA §110(a)(2)(d) to require states to 
eliminate emissions from power plants in their state that contribute significantly to 
downwind PM2.5 or ozone nonattainment or maintenance areas. EPA’s proposed mechanism 
for achieving these emission reductions is to use a tightly constrained trading program that 
requires a strict emission ceiling in each state while allowing a limited ability to shift 
emissions between facilities or states. This approach ensures that emissions in each state that 
significantly contribute to downwind nonattainment or maintenance areas are controlled, 
while allowing power companies to adjust generation based on fluctuations in electricity 
demand, weather, availability of low-emitting power sources (e.g. temporary shut-down of a 
nuclear power plant for maintenance or repairs), or other unanticipated factors affecting the 
interconnected electricity grid.  
Any emissions above the state’s allocated level must be offset by emission reductions 
from another state in the region below that state’s budget or by using extra “banked” 
allowances from earlier years. All sources must hold enough allowances to cover their 
emissions; therefore, if they emit more than their allocation they must buy allowances from 
another source that emitted less than its allocation. PM2.5 and ozone pollution from power 
plants have both local and regional components: part of the pollution in a given location – 
even in locations near emissions sources – is due to emissions from nearby sources and part 
is due to emissions that travel hundreds of miles and mix with emissions from other sources. 
Therefore, in many instances the exact location of the upwind reductions does not affect the 
levels of air pollution downwind. 
It is important to recognize that the section of the Clean Air Act providing authority 
for this rule, 110(a)(2)(D), unlike some other provisions, does not dictate levels of control for 
particular facilities. None of EPA’s alternatives within this proposal can ensure there will be 
no emission increases at any facility. Under the direct control alternative, the emission rate 
for each facility is reduced but each facility could emit more by increasing their power output 
in order to meet electricity reliability or other goals. Under the intrastate trading option, state 
emissions must stay constant but individual facilities within each state could increase their 
emissions as long as another facility in the state had decreased theirs. By strictly setting state 
  
 
 
 
 
326 
budgets to eliminate the portion of significant contributions to non-attainment and 
maintenance areas that EPA has identified in today’s action, by limiting the amount of 
interstate trading possible and by requiring any emissions above the level of the allocations 
to be offset by emission decreases elsewhere in the region, the proposed remedy options 
reduce ambient concentrations where they are most needed. 
EPA’s emissions modeling data indicate that nationwide SO2 emissions from electric 
generating units (EGUs) will be approximately 6.4 million tons (60%) lower in 2014 than 
they were in 2005 (which is the year that the Clean Air Interstate Rule was finalized). 
Emissions would also decrease when compared to the base case (the base case estimates of 
SO2 emissions in 2014 in the absence of this proposed rule or the Clean Air Interstate Rule it 
is replacing). SO2 emissions under this proposed rule are projected to be approximately 4.4 
million tons (50%) lower than they would have been in 2014 in the base case (i.e. without 
this rule).  
EPA’s modeling does project that some states not covered by one or more aspects of 
the program may experience increases of SO2 emissions (i.e., their emissions are greater in 
the control case modeling than in the base case modeling). These emission increases are the 
result of forecasted changes in operation of units outside of the controlled region (due to the 
interconnected nature of the utility grid or influence of the rule on the market for lower sulfur 
coal). As shown in Table IV.D.6 of the preamble, Arkansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, and Texas all exhibit 2012 SO2 emissions increases over the base case of more 
than 5,000 tons. Texas is projected to have by far the largest increase (136,000 tons), while 
the other states’ increases range from 6,000 to 32,000 tons. Further analysis with the 
simplified air quality assessment tool indicates that these projected increases in the Texas 
SO2 emissions would increase Texas’s contribution to an amount that would exceed the 0.15 
μg/m3 threshold for annual PM2.5.  For this reason, EPA requests comment on whether Texas 
should be included in the program as a group 2 state. For additional details, see section IV.D 
of the preamble for this rule. 
EPA’s emissions modeling data indicates that nationwide ozone season NOx 
emissions from EGUs will be approximately 400,000 tons (30%) lower in 2014 than they 
were in 2005 (before implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule). Emissions would also 
  
 
 
 
 
327 
decrease compared to the base case. Ozone season NOx emissions from EGUs under this 
proposed rule are projected to be approximately 150,000 tons (15%) lower than they would 
have been in 2014 in the base case (i.e. without this rule). EPA anticipates that additional 
upcoming actions, and likely additional interstate transport reductions to help states attain the 
proposed 2010 ozone NAAQS, will result in significant additional NOx reductions. 
EPA anticipates that this proposed action will significantly reduce, but not eliminate, 
the number of nonattainment and maintenance areas for the 1997 ozone and PM2.5 and 2006 
PM2.5 NAAQS. Table IX-1 of the preamble lists the changes in number of nonattainment 
sites. Most of these sites are located in urban areas. A single nonattainment area usually 
contains multiple monitoring sites; therefore there are more nonattainment sites than 
nonattainment counties or areas. As discussed in detail in section IV.D of the preamble, 
where this proposal does not fully quantify all of the significant contribution and interference 
with maintenance, EPA intends to address these additional requirements quickly.  To the 
extent possible, EPA will supplement this proposed notice with additional information so 
that we can provide downwind states with all the certainty about upwind emission reductions 
they need to address their own local nonattainment concerns. In addition, as stated above, 
elimination of these nonattainment areas may require both local and regional emission 
reductions and this proposed action seeks only to address the regional transport component. 
As a result of these SO2 and NOx reductions, EPA’s air quality modeling indicates 
that concentrations of fine particles will decline throughout the eastern U.S. and in all the 
states affected by this rule. These reductions are largest in the area of the Ohio River valley 
and neighboring states and extend east through New England, west to Texas, south to 
Florida, and north through the Great Lakes states. “Border” states immediately outside the 
transport region are also predicted to see reductions in air concentrations, even though 
emissions increase in some of these states. This is because concentrations of fine particles in 
most locations are composed of both local emissions and those transported over hundreds of 
miles and emission reductions far away can cause significant improvements in local air 
quality.   
The modeling suggests also that there may be some small increases in PM2.5 near 
locations in the western U.S. where SO2 emissions are forecast to increase. These increases 
  
 
 
 
 
328 
are small compared to the reductions predicted to take place in the eastern U.S. The increases 
are due to the regional nature of this rule (i.e. these states are not covered because sources in 
these states have not been found to contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or 
maintenance areas) and the national nature of both coal markets and the Acid Rain Program 
allowance market. They are not the result of any particular type of remedy option (e.g. 
trading). EPA anticipates that future rulemakings, such as CAA section 112(d) standards and 
anticipated revisions to the 2006 fine particulate standards, are likely to reduce emissions in 
the areas not covered by this rule. 
EPA’s air quality modeling also indicates that concentrations of ozone will decline in 
much of the eastern U.S. These reductions are largest along much of the Gulf Coast and in 
Florida and in a region encompassing western Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, 
and northeastern Oklahoma. These areas with the largest reductions are roughly the area 
immediately outside the boundaries of the NOx SIP Call region. States in the SIP Call region 
were required to make significant reductions in NOx beginning in 2003 and these emission 
reductions are included in the baseline modeling for this proposed Transport Rule and 
therefore not captured as additional benefits of this rulemaking.  
As is common when modeling many NOx control strategies, the air quality modeling 
for this proposed rule also suggests there may be a few small, localized areas in the Eastern 
U.S. where there are small increases in ozone concentrations. These generally small 
increases are a result of reductions in NOx emissions in these local areas; they do not appear 
to represent a lack of NOx emissions reductions or be the result of any specific emission 
control strategy (e.g. any type of trading). Rather, this phenomenon can result from complex 
atmospheric chemistry reactions taking place among chemical constituents of air pollution in 
these areas. Due to the complex photochemistry of ozone production, NOx emissions lead to 
both the formation and destruction of ozone, depending on the relative quantities of NOx, 
volatile organic compounds, and ozone formation catalysts. In the 2014 base case, NOx 
emissions from sources in a few locations act to “quench” (i.e., lower) ozone compared to 
ozone concentrations in surrounding areas.  The application of NOx controls in these areas 
reduces this quenching effect, thereby increasing ozone to levels generally on par with those 
of the surrounding area. In this case it is uncertain whether the structure of the model itself is 
potentially exacerbating the spatial extent or magnitude of any ozone increases which might 
  
 
 
 
 
329 
actually occur as a result of this rule. It should be noted that these same NOx emission 
reductions that might be causing extremely localized ozone increases are certainly causing 
larger, more widespread improvements in ozone concentrations in downwind areas. Finally, 
as stated in the preamble, it is important to note that EPA intends to promulgate additional 
rules over the next few years that will further reduce concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 and 
that the federal government and the states can and do use many different legal authorities to 
limit exposure to ozone.  
Health benefits. This rule reduces concentrations of PM2.5  and ozone pollution, 
exposure to which can cause, or contribute to, adverse health effects including premature 
mortality and many types of heart and lung diseases that affect many minority and low-
income individuals, and Tribal communities. PM2.5 and ozone are particularly (but not 
exclusively) harmful to children, the elderly, and people with existing heart and lung 
diseases, including asthma. Exposure to these pollutants can cause premature death and 
trigger heart attacks, asthma attacks in those with asthma, chronic and acute bronchitis, 
emergency room visits and hospitalizations, as well as milder illnesses that keep children 
home from school and adults home from work. High rates of both heart disease and asthma 
are a cause for concern in many environmental justice communities, making these 
populations more susceptible to air pollution health impacts. In addition, many individuals in 
these communities also lack access to high quality health care to treat these illnesses.  
We estimate that in 2014 the PM-related annual benefits of the proposed remedy 
option include approximately 14,000 to 36,000 fewer premature mortalities, 9,200 fewer 
cases of chronic bronchitis, 22,000 fewer non-fatal heart attacks, 11,000 fewer 
hospitalizations (for respiratory and cardiovascular disease combined), 10 million fewer days 
of restricted activity due to respiratory illness and approximately 1.8 million fewer lost work 
days. We also estimate substantial health improvements for children in the form of fewer 
cases of upper and lower respiratory illness, acute bronchitis, and asthma attacks. 
Ozone health-related benefits are expected to occur during the summer ozone season 
(usually ranging from May to September in the Eastern U.S.). Based upon modeling for 
2014, annual ozone related health benefits are expected to include between 50 and 230 fewer 
premature mortalities, 690 fewer hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses, 230 fewer 
  
 
 
 
 
330 
emergency room admissions for asthma, 300,000 fewer days with restricted activity levels, 
and 110,000 fewer days where children are absent from school due to illnesses. When adding 
the PM and ozone-related mortalities together, we find that the proposed remedy option for 
this rule will yield between 14,000 and 36,000 fewer premature mortalities. EPA has also 
estimated the benefits of the alternate remedies in this proposal using a benefit-per-ton 
estimation approach and found they would provide similar benefits.  
It should be noted that, as discussed in the RIA for this action, there are other benefits 
to the emission reductions discussed here, such as improved visibility and, indirectly, 
reduced mercury deposition. Additional benefits of reducing emissions of SO2 include 
reduced acidification of lakes and streams, and reduced mercury methylation; additional 
benefits of NOx reductions include reduced acidification of lakes and streams and reduced 
coastal eutrophication. Conversely, it is possible that the modest increases in emissions 
modeled for this rule in some western areas could result in limited increases of one or more 
of these effects in these locations. 
9.4.3. Meaningful Public Participation 
During the comment period for this proposed rule, EPA intends to reach out 
specifically to environmental justice communities and organizations to notify them of the 
opportunity to provide comments on this rule and to solicit their comments on both this rule 
and the upcoming actions described above and in section III.E of the preamble. EPA will 
hold public hearings on this rule; see the information at the very beginning of the preamble 
for locations, times and dates. Comments can also be submitted in writing or electronically 
by following the instructions at the beginning of the preamble. 
  
 
 
 
 
331 
9.4.4   Summary 
EPA believes that the vast majority of communities and individuals in areas covered 
by this rule, including numerous low-income, minority, and Tribal communities in both rural 
areas and inner cities in the East, will see significant improvements in air quality and 
resulting improvements in health.  EPA also recognizes that there is the potential for a 
number of communities or individuals outside the region covered by this rule to experience 
slightly worse air quality as an indirect result of emission reductions required under this 
proposal. EPA requests comment on the impacts of this proposed action on low income, 
minority, and Tribal communities. EPA will further analyze environmental justice issues 
related to the impacts of the rule on those communities based both on additional data that 
may be developed and on comments on those issues prior to final action on this rule.

CHAPTER 10 
COMPARISON OF BENEFITS AND COSTS 
 
10.1 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
The estimated social costs to implement the proposed Transport Rule, as described in 
this document, are approximately $2.03 or $2.23 billion annually for 2014 (2006 dollars, 3 
percent and 7 percent discount rate, respectively).   Thus, the net benefits (social benefits 
minus social costs) of the program in 2014 are approximately $120 to 292 + B billion or 
$109 to 264 + B billion annually (2006 dollars, based on a discount rate of 3 percent and 7 
percent, respectively and rounded to three significant figures).  (B represents the sum of all 
unquantified benefits and disbenefits of the regulation.)  Therefore, implementation of this 
rule is expected, based purely on economic efficiency criteria, to provide society with a 
significant net gain in social welfare, even given the limited set of health and environmental 
effects we were able to quantify.  Addition of directly emitted PM2.5-, mercury-, 
acidification-, and eutrophication-related impacts would likely increase the net benefits of the 
rule.  Table 10-1 presents a summary of the benefits, costs, and net benefits of the final rule.  
The capital costs spent for pollution controls installed for CAIR were not included in 
the annual social costs reported here since the Transport Rule did not lead to their 
installation. Those CAIR-related capital investments are roughly estimated to have an annual 
social cost less than 1.15 -1.29 billion dollars (under the two discount rates).  EPA developed 
this estimate using the annual capital costs for compliance for the original CAIR rule in 2005 
from its RIA modeling with IPM.  That modeling estimated capital costs for 2010 and 2015 
in 1999$ that we first converted to 2006$ and then interpolated to a 2012 value ($1.6 billion). 
 This value represents a rough estimate of the cost of the CAIR pollution controls that EPA 
recognizes were in place in this Transport Rule RIA.  We then converted this estimate of 
compliance costs to social costs appropriate for comparison to the above costs used in the 
benefit cost analysis.  Notably, several states and EPA settlement agreements in recent years 
have actually required the pollution controls that we projected in CAIR by 2014, so the range 
offered above should be viewed as a likely upper bound of the capital costs solely

attributable to the original CAIR rules. 
Air quality modeling was not conducted for the two alternative remedy options (state 
budgets/intrastate trading and direct control).  We estimate the benefits of these alternatives 
by applying a benefit per-ton approach described in Chapter 5 of this RIA. While these 
benefit per ton estimates quantify the health impacts and monetized benefits of reductions in 
PM2.5, they omit important welfare benefits including changes in recreational visibility. 
Table 10-2 below presents the social costs and health benefits, including net social benefit, of 
these two alternative remedies alongside that of the proposed Transport Rule remedy. 
EPA also analyzed the costs and benefits of two scenarios that differ from the 
proposed State Budgets/Limited Trading in the stringency of SO2 budgets beginning in 2014. 
 Unlike the proposed Transport Rule, these scenarios are not the result of extensive analysis 
of each state’s significant contribution.  Nor do they necessarily represent EPA’s view of 
what emission reductions are required by section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act.  
Rather, they are designed to show the effects of more or less stringent reduction requirements 
in a structure otherwise the same as the proposed State Budgets/Limited Trading remedy. 
Both scenarios represent the same type of remedy as in the proposed FIPs and have 
the same 2012 requirements.  In addition to requirements beginning in 2012 for annual NOx, 
ozone-season NOx, and SO2, the proposed Transport Rule requires greater SO2 reductions in 
15 states (Group 1) beginning in 2014.  The less stringent of the two scenarios considered 
here removes these 2014 requirements; instead, the 15 states maintain their 2012 
requirements in all subsequent years.  This results in budgets that, relative to the proposed 
Transport Rule, allow about 1.4 million tons more SO2 to be emitted annually. 
The more stringent of the two scenarios changes the requirement for Group 1 SO2 
emissions reductions beginning in 2014 and moves 8 additional states to Group 1 from 
Group 2.  Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, and 
New Jersey join the 15 Group 1 states of the proposed rule, making 23 states in all and 
leaving 4 states and the District of Columbia in Group 2.  Also, an additional 200,000 tons of 
SO2 reduction beyond that required in the proposed rule is required in the 23 Group 1 states. 
Air quality modeling was not conducted for these alternatives; thus we estimated the 
  
 
 
 
 
334 
benefits of these alternatives by applying the same benefit per-ton approach as done for the 
alternative remedy options.  The compliance costs of these alternatives are estimated using 
IPM.  The social costs of these alternatives are estimated using EMPAX.83    Table 10-3 
presents the social costs and health benefits, including net social benefit, of the two scenarios 
alongside that of the proposed Transport Rule remedy.

 As with any complex analysis of this scope, there are several uncertainties inherent in 
the final estimate of benefits and costs that are described fully in Chapters 5 and 7.  In 
addition to the uncertainty characterization provided in these chapters, we also present two 
types of probabilistic approaches to characterize uncertainty in the benefit estimate of the 
proposed Transport Rule.  The first approach generates a distribution of benefits based on the 
classical statistical error expressed in the underlying health and economic valuation studies 
used in the benefits modeling framework.  The second approach uses the results from a pilot 
expert elicitation project designed to characterize key aspects of uncertainty in the ambient 
PM2.5/mortality relationship, and augments the uncertainties in the mortality estimate with 
the statistical error reported for other endpoints in the benefit analysis.

HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF DIRECT CONTROL AND INTRASTATE 
TRADING REMEDIES AND PRESENTATION OF STATE-LEVEL BENEFITS OF 
PROPOSED REMEDY 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
341 
Synopsis 
This appendix summarizes the results of the human health benefits assessment of the 
direct control and intrastate trading remedies using PM2.5 benefit per ton estimates. The 
PM2.5-related benefits of the direct control remedy are between $120 and $290 billion 
(2006$) discounted at 3% and between $110 and $260 billion (2006$) discounted at 7%. The 
benefits of the intrastate trading remedy are between $110 and $280 billion (2006$) 
discounted at 3% and between $100 and $250 billion (2006$) discounted at 7%. In addition, 
this appendix includes state-level estimates of benefits of the proposed remedy.  Due to 
methodological limitations, these estimates omit important benefits categories, including 
benefits from reduced ozone exposure, visibility improvement and ecological improvements. 
  
A.1 Methods 
 
In section 5.2.3 of the Benefits chapter we describe our approach to estimating a 
PM2.5 benefit per ton metric. In the interest of completeness, we repeat this discussion here. 
Benefit per-ton (BPT) estimates quantify the health impacts and monetized human health 
benefits of an incremental change in air pollution precursor emissions. In situations when we 
are unable to perform air quality modeling because of resource or time constraints, this 
approach can provide a reliable estimate of the benefits of emission reduction scenarios. EPA 
has used the benefit per-ton technique in previous RIAs, including the recent Ozone NAAQS 
RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008) and NO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010).  Time constraints prevented 
the Agency from modeling the air quality changes resulting from either the intrastate and 
direct control remedies or the more and less stringent SO2 caps and so we estimate a subset 
of these health benefits using PM2.5 benefit per-ton estimates. The assessment of the alternate 
scenarios omits ozone-related benefits for two reasons. First, the overall level of ozone-
related benefits in the modeled case is relatively small compared to those associated with 
PM2.5 reductions (see table 5-17 in the Benefits chapter), due in part to the fairly modest 
summer time NOx emission reductions under this scenario. The level of summertime NOx 
emission reductions of the alternate scenarios are very similar to the modeled scenario, 
suggesting that the omission of ozone-related impacts would not greatly influence the overall 
level of benefits. Second, the complex non-linear chemistry of ozone formation introduces 
  
 
 
 
 
342 
uncertainty to the development and application of a benefit per ton estimate. Taken together, 
these factors argued against developing an ozone benefit per ton estimate for this RIA.   
For this analysis, EPA applies PM2.5 BPT estimates that are methodologically consistent 
with those reported in Fann et al. (2009), but have been adjusted for this analysis to better 
match the spatial distribution of air quality changes projected for the Transport Rule. To 
derive the BPT estimates for this analysis, we: 
1. Quantified the PM2.5 -related human and monetized health benefits of the SO2 
emission reductions of the proposed remedy. We first quantified the health impacts and 
monetized benefits of total PM2.5 mass formed from the SO2 reductions of the proposed 
remedy, allowing us to isolate the PM air quality impacts from SO2 reductions alone.84 
This procedure allowed us to develop PM2.5 BPT estimates that quantified the PM2.5-
related benefits of incremental changes in SO2 emissions. Because reductions in NOx 
emissions are relatively small in each scenario, and previous EPA modeling indicates 
that PM2.5 formation is less sensitive to NOx emission reductions on a per-µg/m3 basis 
(U.S. EPA, 2006d), we did not quantify the NOx -related PM2.5 changes. 
 
2. Divided the health impacts and monetized benefits by the emission reduction. This 
calculation yields BPT estimates for PM-related SO2. 
 
The resulting BPT estimates were then multiplied by the projected SO2 emission 
reductions for the Direct Control and Intrastate Trading remedy options to produce an 
estimate of the PM- and ozone-related health impacts and monetized benefits. There is no 
analogous approach for estimating a BPT for visibility, and so the benefits of the alternative 
                                                 
84 The Transport Rule includes both SO2 and NOx emissions reductions.  In general SO2 is a precursor to 
particulate sulfate and NOx is a precursor to particulate nitrate.  However, there are also several interactions 
between the PM2.5 precursors which cannot be easily quantified.  For example, under conditions in which SO2 
levels are reduced by a substantial margin, "nitrate replacement" may occur.  This occurs when particulate 
ammonium sulfate concentrations are reduced, thereby freeing up excess gaseous ammonia.  The excess 
ammonia is then available to react with gaseous nitric acid to form particulate nitrate.  The impact of nitrate 
replacement is also affected by concurrent NOx reductions.  NOx reductions can lead to decreases in nitrate, 
which competes with the process of nitrate replacement.  NOx reductions can also lead to reductions in 
photochemical by-products which can reduce both particulate sulfate and secondary organic carbon PM 
concentrations.  Due to the complex nature of these interactions, EPA performed a sensitivity modeling analysis 
in which only SO2 emissions were reduced.  We calculated benefits from this air quality modeling run to 
generate an SO2-only benefit per ton estimate.  The results of the SO2-only sensitivity run may be found in the 
EPA Benefits TSD [Docket  No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0491] 
  
 
 
 
 
343 
remedies omit this important monetized benefit. The PM-related benefits of the two 
alternative remedies are roughly commensurate with the total benefits of the proposed 
remedy; this is due in large part to the roughly similar emission reductions achieved under 
each of the preferred and alternate remedies and the fact that EPA used air quality modeling 
for the proposed remedy to generate as the basis for the benefit per ton estimates 
subsequently used to quantify the benefits of the two alternate remedies not modeled.  
 
A.2  Results 
 
Following the procedure described above, we calculated PM2.5 benefit per-ton 
estimates summarized in Table A-1. We then calculated the reduction in incidence of PM2.5 
adverse health effects for each remedy option and present the results in Table A-2.  Finally, 
we present the benefits associated with the reduction in incidence of these adverse health 
effects for each remedy option and present the results in Table A-3.  For comparison 
purposes these tables also includes the PM-related benefits of the proposed remedy.

B.1 Direct Control Remedy Option 
B.1.1 Macroeconomic Variables and Social Costs 
The transport rule will bring about changes in business and household behavior and 
will influence macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product [GDP] and consumption) 
and household economic welfare. In 2015, EMPAX estimates that GDP and consumption 
levels are approximately 0.02% lower ($2.7 billion) (Figure B-1) 85 Since the pollution 
controls vary by region, economic effects also vary by region; for example, Northeast GDP 
falls by 0.04% (Figure B-2).

Note: GDP represents the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the US in 2015.  Consumption is 
the dollar value of all goods and services consumed within the US in 2015.  Hicksian EV is the change in 
household economic welfare (defined in Section 8.1.3.1).

Note:  GDP in each region is the dollar value of goods and services produced in the region in 2015.  See Figure 8-2 for a 
presentation of the states in each region. 
Average-annual social costs (as measured by Hicksian equivalent variation) are 
approximately 0.01% lower with the transport rule.86 As noted in Chapter 8, EMPAX-CGE 
does not incorporate any environmental benefits associated with air quality improvements. 
As a result, EMPAX welfare measures only approximate the rule’s social cost. Using this 
interpretation, the annual social cost for 2015 is estimated to be $2.9 billion.  
                                                 
86 Values are discounted back to 2010 at the 5% interest rate used in the model.  EPA uses a 5% interest rate 
based on the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and SAB guidance from 2003 as 
discussed in U.S. EPA, Office of Policy Analysis and Review. 2003. “Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 
1990 - 2020: Revised Analytical Plan for EPA's Second Prospective Analysis.”  We recognize that this interest 
rate is not one of the interest rates (3 and 7%) that OMB’s Circular A-4 guidance calls for in regulatory 
analyses. .  Detailed results for this EMPAX run for the direct control remedy can be found in the file 
“EMPAXresults_direct control remedy,” that is available in the docket for this rule.

B.1.2 Industry Effects 
The proposed rule directly influences the electricity sector’s fuel use and private cost 
expenditures. As the electricity sector responds to these changes, other economy-wide 
changes occur. For example, higher electricity prices may encourage electricity-dependent 
sectors to reduce production levels, switch to other energy sources (e.g., oil) and/or seek 
energy efficiency improvements in their production process. Electricity sectors also make 
additional private cost expenditures in order to comply with the transport rule; these 
expenditures lead to other economy-wide changes. For example each dollar spent to comply 
with the program is used to buy environmental protection goods and services.87 As a result, 
the demand for environmental protection goods and services will be higher with the transport 
rule. For sectors supplying environmental protection goods or services, the secondary effect 
may offset higher electricity costs. The following sections report and discuss output changes 
associated with the impacts of compliance in the year 2015, which serves as a proxy for 
compliance in 2014. 
B.1.2.1   Energy Sectors 
The EMPAX modeling system shows that the electricity sector experiences the most 
significant changes under the transport rule. Electricity output and fuel mix changes used to 
meet the transport rule also influence other energy sectors. For example, U.S. electricity 
output declines by approximately 0.5%, while coal output declines by 0.2%. Similarly, U.S. 
natural gas output declines. Crude oil and petroleum output decline but the changes are 
small; these inputs are less critical to the electricity sector, making them less sensitive to 
changes in electricity production (Figure B-3). 
Given the regional distribution of controls, there are differences in regional output 
changes. For example, electricity production in the Northeast experiences the largest decline 
while the Plains and West electricity sectors see small output increases. Very few States in 
the Plains and no Western States are included in the Transport Rule region, and lack of 
emission controls applied in these regions may mean lower electricity generation and 
dispatch costs relative to such costs to States within the Transport Rule region.   This is an 
                                                 
87 Additional details are described in EMPAX-CGE model documentation (5-2 to 5-5). 
  
 
 
 
 
359 
explanation for the small output increases in the Plains and West.   Coal output changes to 
meet coal demand predictions from the IPM electricity model and the IPM modeling system 
suggest that the Northeast’s electricity sector uses additional coal inputs to meet the rule’s 
requirements. 
B.1.2.2   Energy-Intensive Sectors 
Energy-intensive manufacturing industries are more sensitive to electricity and other 
energy price changes. Although the net U.S. output change for each energy-intensive 
industry is less than 0.2%, these sectors do show some (economically small) regional 
variation. The most significant regional differences are seen in the aluminum sector, where 
production shifts from the Northeast, South, and Midwest regions to the Plains and West 
regions. Similar geographic shifts are observed in other energy-intensive industries 
(Figure B-4). 
B.1.2.3   Nonenergy Sectors 
Although electricity expenditures represent a small fraction of non-energy sector 
production costs, higher electricity prices still influence non-energy sector production levels. 
However, non-energy sector output effects are very small. National output levels for four 
broad non-energy sectors: agriculture, other manufacturing, services, and transportation fall 
by less than one one-hundredth of a percent (0.01%). There is some regional variation as 
production shifts to areas with lower electricity costs (e.g., West, Plains), but the differences 
are not significant (Figure B-5).

B.2 Intrastate Trading Remedy Option 
B.2.1 Macroeconomic Variables and Social Costs 
The transport rule will bring about changes in business and household behavior and 
will influence macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product [GDP] and consumption) 
and household economic welfare. In 2015, EMPAX estimates that GDP and consumption 
levels are approximately 0.01% lower ($1.1 billion change in GDP and $1.2 billion change in 
consumption) (Figure B-6).88 Since the pollution controls vary by region, economic effects 
also vary by region; for example, Northeast GDP falls by 0.04% (Figure B-7).

GDP Consumption Hicksian EV (Annual)  
Note: GDP represents the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the US in 2015.  Consumption is 
the dollar value of all goods and services consumed within the US in 2015.  Hicksian EV is the change in 
household economic welfare (defined in Section 8.1.3.1 of this RIA). 
 
 
                                                 
88 We use 2015 estimates as a proxy for the impacts of compliance with the proposed rule in 2014.

Note:  GDP in each region is the dollar value of goods and services produced in the region in 2015.  See Figure 8-2 for a 
presentation of the states in each region. 
Average-annual social costs (as measured by Hicksian equivalent variation) are 
approximately 0.01% lower with the transport rule.89 As noted in Chapter 8, EMPAX-CGE 
does not incorporate any environmental benefits associated with air quality improvements. 
As a result, EMPAX welfare measures only approximate the rule’s social cost. Using this 
interpretation, the annual social cost for 2015 is estimated to be $2.7 billion.  
                                                 
89 Values are discounted back to 2010 at the 5% interest rate used in the model. EPA uses a 5% interest rate 
based on the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and SAB guidance from 2003 as 
discussed in U.S. EPA, Office of Policy Analysis and Review. 2003. “Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 
1990 - 2020: Revised Analytical Plan for EPA's Second Prospective Analysis.”  We recognize that this interest 
rate is not one of the interest rates (3 and 7%) that OMB’s Circular A-4 guidance calls for in regulatory 
analyses.   Detailed results for this EMPAX run for the intrastate trading remedy can be found in the file 
“EMPAXresults_intrastate trading remedy,” that is available in the docket for this rule.

B.2.2 Industry Effects 
The proposed rule directly influences the electricity sector’s fuel use and private cost 
expenditures. As the electricity sector responds to these changes, other economy-wide 
changes occur. For example, higher electricity prices may encourage electricity-dependent 
sectors to reduce production levels, switch to other energy sources (e.g., oil) and/or seek 
energy efficiency improvements in their production process. Electricity sectors also make 
additional private cost expenditures in order to comply with the transport rule; these 
expenditures lead to other economy-wide changes. For example each dollar spent to comply 
with the program is used to buy environmental protection goods and services.90 As a result, 
the demand for environmental protection goods and services will be higher with the transport 
rule. For sectors supplying environmental protection goods or services, the secondary effect 
may offset higher electricity costs. The following sections report and discuss output changes 
associated with the impacts of compliance in the year 2015, which serves as a proxy for 
compliance in 2014. 
B.2.2.1   Energy Sectors 
The EMPAX modeling system shows that the electricity sector experiences the most 
significant changes under the transport rule. Electricity output and fuel mix changes used to 
meet the transport rule also influence other energy sectors. For example, U.S. electricity 
output declines by approximately 0.3%, while coal output declines by 0.4%. Similarly, U.S. 
natural gas output declines. Crude oil and petroleum output decline but the changes are 
small; these inputs are less critical to the electricity sector, making them less sensitive to 
changes in electricity production (Figure B-8). 
Given the regional distribution of controls, there are differences in regional output 
changes. For example, electricity production in the Northeast experiences the largest decline 
while the Plains and West electricity sectors see small output increases. Very few States in 
the Plains and no Western States are included in the Transport Rule region, and lack of 
emission controls applied in these regions may mean lower electricity generation and 
                                                 
90 Additional details are described in EMPAX-CGE model documentation (5-2 to 5-5).

dispatch costs relative to such costs to States within the Transport Rule region.   This is an 
explanation for the small output increases in the Plains and West.   Coal output changes to 
meet coal demand predictions from the IPM electricity model and the IPM modeling system 
suggest that the Northeast’s electricity sector uses additional coal inputs to meet the rule’s 
requirements. 
B.2.2.2  Energy-Intensive Sectors 
Energy-intensive manufacturing industries are more sensitive to electricity and other 
energy price changes. Although the net U.S. output change for each energy-intensive 
industry is less than 0.2%, these sectors do show some (economically small) regional 
variation. The most significant regional differences are seen in the aluminum sector, where 
production shifts from the Northeast, South, and Midwest regions to the Plains and West 
regions. Similar geographic shifts are observed in other energy-intensive industries 
(Figure B-9). 
B.2.2.3  Nonenergy Sectors 
Although electricity expenditures represent a small fraction of non-energy sector 
production costs, higher electricity prices still influence non-energy sector production levels. 
However, non-energy sector output effects are very small. National output levels for four 
broad non-energy sectors: agriculture, other manufacturing, services, and transportation fall 
by less than one one-hundredth of a percent (0.01%). There is some regional variation as 
production shifts to areas with lower electricity costs (e.g., West, Plains), but the differences 
are not significant (Figure B-10).

This table shows the SO2 emissions for each state in the contiguous US that result from the base case and the 
main control options.  Notably, states adjacent to the Transport region states can have emissions increase to 
some degree due to change in relative dispatch economics from where the border exists for the Transport region. 
 Note that in the West the increased emissions result from the Court’s decision to not allow the use of Title IV 
allowances in this program and the resulting collapse of the ARP trading market.  This occurs in both direct 
control and trading cases. 
Emissions are for fossil EGUs with capacity greater than 25 MW.

APPENDIX E 
ALLOWANCE VALUES FOR EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS 
  
 
 
 
 
382 
Allowance Values for Emissions Trading Programs 
As discussed in Chapter 7 above, the proposed State Budgets/Limited Trading 
remedy and alternative State Budgets/Intrastate Trading remedy both include emissions 
trading programs.  State Budgets/Limited Trading features programs for annual NOx,92 
ozone-season NOx,93 annual SO2 for the 15 Group 1 states,94 and annual SO2 for the 13 
Group 2 states.95  In contrast, State Budgets/Intrastate Trading includes separate emissions 
trading programs for each pollutant in each affected state, a total of 82 programs. 
Tables E-1 through E-3 below show the projected allowance values resulting from 
modeling of these remedy options using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM).  Values for 
SO2 reflect the marginal cost of reducing SO2, including the operation of dispatchable flue 
gas desulfurization controls (FGD).  Section 6 of the TSD “Updates to EPA Base Case v3.02 
EISA Using the Integrated Planning Model” contains details on the definition and 
determination of dispatchable controls. 
Similarly, NOx allowance values reflect the marginal cost of reducing NOx, including 
the variable operation and maintenance costs of existing controls.96  For example, an 
allowance price of $500 per ton (reflecting variable cost of operating SCRs) for annual NOx 
                                                 
92 The 28 states in this program are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
93 The 26 states in this program are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West 
Virginia. 
94 Group 1 states are Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
95 Group 2 states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, and South Carolina. 
96 Because the variable operating cost of an SCR is very similar for most SCRs (about $500/ton), EPA’s 
modeling of dispatchable SCRs assumes that those SCRs are operated under a cap, rather than modeling each 
economic decision independently.  Because these costs are not then factored into IPM’s marginal cost 
calculation,  EPA exogenously assigns an allowance price of $500/ton if the projected NOx allowance price in 
IPM is less than $500/ton. 
  
 
 
 
 
383 
indicates that compliance can be achieved through year-round operation of existing advanced 
NOx controls without the use of more expensive compliance options, such as incrementally 
installing new post-combustion controls.  Rules for determining whether NOx controls in the 
model operate year-round can be found in the Chapter 3 Appendix of the Documentation for 
EPA Base Case 2004 Using IPM (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-
ipm/docs/bc3appendix.pdf).

For SO2 allowances, in group 1 states, allowance prices are lower than $2,000/ton in 
2014 for two reasons (note that all allowance prices are across all states in the applicable 
trading region).  First, because of banking allowances in 2012 and 2013, less reduction is 
necessary in 2014.  Second, because of the interstate trading companies have more flexibility 
to take advantage of the lowest cost reduction opportunities.  Group 2 allowances are lower 
than $500/ton in 2014, because in some states, additional SO2 controls are installed between 
2012 and 2014 due to requirements outside of this rule.  Allowance prices are higher than 
$500/ton in 2012 because EPA state budgets were based on the performance of units in 2009 
(which reflects improved performance of units complying with Phase I of the CAIR NOx 
program and banking substantially for the CAIR SO2 program), while modeling in IPM did 
not reflect all of those recent improvements.  Actual improved performance that was used to 
develop the budgets is therefore not always reflected in the model (e.g. better performance of 
low NOx burners and scrubbers and access to lower sulfur coals).  In its final modeling, EPA 
  
 
 
 
 
384 
will update IPM to reflect the better unit performance seen in 2009.  This will likely result in 
lower allowance prices.

97 In Connecticut IPM’s original modeling (which was used in the determination of significant contribution) did 
not account for the fact that Connecticut’s largest coal unit uses a significantly lower sulfur coal than normally 
projected by IPM.  In the final cost modeling, EPA adjusted the coals assigned to this unit to reflect the sulfur 
content of the coal actually used.  This results in Connecticut meeting its budget with an allowance cost of 
$0/ton (e.g. without making any emission reductions).  In modeling Connecticut in the final rule, EPA will 
account for the lower sulfur content coal throughout the entire analytic process.  This could result in a lower SO2 
budget for Connecticut.

 While most of the allowance prices seen in the state-by-state modeling for the 
Intrastate Trading alternative are consistent with the allowance prices that would be expected 
based on EPA’s significant contribution modeling, there are some exceptions.  For example, 
while two-thirds of the states have NOx allowance prices near $500/ton, a number of states 
do see higher allowance prices.  This is because the budgets were based on the lower of IPM 
emission projections or projections of emissions using actual unit performance data (as 
explained in the Technical Support Document – “State Budgets, Unit Allocations and Unit 
Emission Rates”).  Because IPM has not been updated to reflect actual NOx emission rates 
seen in 2009, IPM projects that it will be harder to meet those budgets than the most recent 
real world data shows it will be (this is why EPA considered the most current data as well as 
the IPM projections in setting the budgets).  Between proposal and final rulemaking, EPA 
will be updating IPM to reflect these lower emission rates.  This also occurs in some of the 
SO2 budgets.  It is most prevalent in either smaller states or states with a larger percentage of 
well-controlled units, where the marginal cost curve for the remaining uncontrolled units is 
steeper and allowance prices are most sensitive to small changes in budgets.   EPA will be 
revising IPM to reflect the most recent real world data between proposal and final.
