AGENCY: Centers for Medicare &

clarify various program participation

ensure that plan offerings to 
beneficiaries include meaningful

and processes; and implement new 
policy such as a Part D formulary 
policy.

I. Background 
A. Overview of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 
2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108–173) was 
enacted on December 8, 2003. The 
MMA established the Part D program 
and made revisions to the provisions in 
Part C of the Medicare statute governing 
the Medicare Advantage (MA) program. 
The MMA directed that important 
aspects of the new Medicare 
prescription drug benefit program under 
Part D be similar to and coordinated 
with regulations for the MA program. 
The MMA also directed 
implementation of the prescription drug 
benefit and revised MA program 
provisions effective January 1, 2006. 
The final rules for the MA and Part D 
prescription drug programs appeared in 
the Federal Register on January 28, 
2005 (70 FR 4588–4741 and 70 FR 
4194–4585, respectively). Many of the 
provisions relating to applications, 
marketing, contracts, and the new 
bidding process for the MA program 
became effective on March 22, 2005, 60 
days after publication of the rule, so that 
the requirements for both programs 
could be implemented by January 1, 
2006. All of the provisions regarding the 
new Part D prescription drug program 
became effective on March 22, 2005. 
As we have gained more experience 
with the MA program and the 
prescription drug benefit program, we 
have revised the Part C and D 
regulations to continue to improve or 
clarify existing policies and/or codify 
current guidance for both programs. For 
example, in December 2007, we 
published a final rule with comment on 
contract determinations involving 
Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations 
and Medicare Part D prescription drug 
plan sponsors (72 FR 68700). In April 
2008, we published a final rule to 
address policy and technical changes to 
the Part D program (73 FR 20486). In 
September 2008 and January 2009, we 
finalized revisions to both the Medicare 
Advantage and prescription drug benefit 
programs (73 FR 54226 and 74 FR 1494, 
respectively) to implement provisions in 
the Medicare Improvement for Patients 
and Providers Act (MIPPA) (Pub. L.110– 
275), which contained provisions 
impacting both the Medicare Part C and 
D programs, and make other policy 
clarifications based on experience with 
both programs (73 FR 54208, 73 FR 
54226, and 74 FR 2881). 
Under this proposed rule, we have 
identified additional programmatic and 
operational changes (outlined below) 
that we believe are needed in order to 
further improve our oversight and 
management of the Part C and D 
programs and to further improve 
beneficiary experience under MA or 
Part D plans. 
B. History and Overview 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 
(BBA) (Pub. L. 105–33) established a 
new ‘‘Part C’’ in the Medicare statute 
(sections 1851 through 1859 of the 
Social Security Act (the Act)) which 
provided for what was then called the 
Medicare+Choice (M+C) program. 
Under section 1851(a)(1) of the Act, 
every individual entitled to Medicare 
Part A and enrolled under Medicare Part 
B, except for most individuals with end- 
stage renal disease (ESRD), could elect 
to receive benefits either through the 
original Medicare program or an M+C 
plan, if one was offered where he or she 
lived. The primary goal of the M+C 
program was to provide Medicare 
beneficiaries with a wider range of 
health plan choices. The M+C 
provisions in Part C were amended by 
the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP 
Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 
1999 (BBRA) (Pub. L. 106–111), and 
further amended by the Medicare, 
Medicaid, and State Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (SCHIP) Benefits 
Improvement Act of 2000 (BIPA) (Pub. 
L. 106–554). 
As noted previously, the MMA was 
enacted on December 8, 2003. Title I of 
the MMA added a new ‘‘Part D’’ to the 
Medicare statute (sections 1860D–1 
through 42 of the Act) creating the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Program, one of the most significant 
changes to the Medicare program since 
its inception in 1965. Sections 201 
through 241 of Title II of the MMA 
made significant changes to the M+C 
program. Title II of the MMA renamed 
the M+C program as the MA program 
and included new payment and bidding 
provisions, new regional MA plans and 
special needs plans, reestablished 
authority for medical savings account 
(MSA) plans that had been provided in 
the BBA on a temporary basis, 
addressed private fee-for-service plans, 
and made other changes. Title I of the 
MMA created prescription drug benefits 
under Medicare Part D, and a new 
retiree drug subsidy program. 
Both the MA and prescription drug 
benefit regulations were published 
separately, as proposed and final rules, 
though their development and 
publication were closely coordinated. 
On August 3, 2004, we published in the 
Federal Register proposed rules for the 
MA program (69 FR 46866 through 
46977) and the prescription drug benefit 
program (69 FR 46632 through 46863). 
In response to public comments on the 
proposed rules, we made several 
revisions to the proposed policies for 
both programs. For further discussion of 
these revisions, see the respective final 
rules (70 FR 4588 through 4741) and (70 
FR 4194 through 4585). 
Also as noted above, MIPPA was 
enacted on July 15, 2008, which 
addressed a number of provisions 
impacting the Part C and D programs, 
including provisions impacting 
marketing under both programs. In the 
September 18, 2008 Federal Register (73 
FR 54208), we published a final rule 
that finalized certain marketing 
provisions, effective October 1, 2008, 
that paralleled provisions in MIPPA. In 
the same issue of the Federal Register 
(73 FR 54226), we published a separate 
interim final rule that addressed the 
other provisions of MIPPA affecting the 
MA and Part D programs. We also 
clarified the MIPPA marketing 
provisions in a November 2008 interim 
final rule (73 FR 67407 and issued a 
separate interim final rule in January 
2009 to address MIPPA provisions 
related to Part D plan formularies (74 FR 
2881). 
Now, with almost four years’ 
experience behind us, we are proposing 
further revisions to these programs 
affecting both beneficiaries and 
sponsoring organizations. 
When the MMA required that the Part 
D benefit afford each enrollee a 
minimum of two choices in each plan 
region, few if any envisioned the 
overwhelming response from the 
healthcare industry would result in 
most beneficiaries choosing among 
dozens of plans with various benefit 
packages. In the first few years of the 
Part D benefit, we believed this was on 
the whole a great success. More plans 
means more variation, competition and 
lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries 
choosing to enroll in a stand-alone 
prescription drug plan (PDP), or 
Medicare Advantage prescription drug 
plan (MA–PD). However, with so many 
plans to choose from many beneficiaries 
reportedly find the annual task of 
selecting one plan from so many 
overwhelming, and confusing. 
Moreover, we have found that, as

Commission. National Opinion Research Center. 
overseers of the Part C and D programs, 
organizations submitting bids to offer 
multiple plans have not consistently 
submitted plan benefit designs that were 
significantly different from each other, 
which can add to beneficiary confusion. 
Since its inception in 2006, the 
Medicare Part D program has improved 
access to drug coverage for elderly and 
offered beneficiaries a wide range of 
plans from which to choose. At the 
same time, some have suggested that 
significant numbers of beneficiaries are 
confused by the array of choices and 
find it difficult to make enrollment 
decisions that are best for them. Many 
do not enroll in necessarily the lowest 
cost plan and many eligible individuals 
are not enrolled in the low-income 
subsidy program. Finally, once 
beneficiaries have chosen a plan and 
enrolled in it, they tend to remain in 
those plans, despite changes in 
medication use or premium increases. 
We remain committed to considering 
changes in the way we administer the 
Part C and D programs to enable 
Medicare beneficiaries to choose the 
plan that best suits their needs. Among 
other proposals, we making following 
three specific proposals to simplify the 
program for beneficiaries: 
• First, we propose to require 
sponsors to ensure that when they 
provide multiple plan offerings, those 
offerings sufficiently differ and thereby 
provide beneficiaries meaningful 
options (see section II. of this proposed 
rule); 
• Second, we propose to eliminate 
plans with persistently low enrollments, 
since these can add complexity to 
choices without adding value (see 
section II.D. of this proposed rule); 
• Third, we propose to require 
sponsors to use standardized 
‘‘templates’’ in their beneficiary 
communication materials (for example, 
the Annual Notice of Changes (ANOC) 
and the Evidence of Coverage (EOC) 
notices), so that seniors can better 
understand how their current benefits 
and cost-sharing requirements will be 
changing and more easily compare their 
current plan with other plan options 
(see section II.B.3 of this proposed rule). 
We believe that more can be done to 
structure choices for seniors to aid them 
in making better plan choices.1 2 For 
example, studies have suggested that 
providing personalized drug utilization 
and cost information to beneficiaries 
can encourage seniors to switch to plans 
that better meet their medication needs 
while reducing their overall costs.3 
Some have urged that the agency can do 
more to provide improved individual 
drug utilization and cost information to 
beneficiaries to encourage seniors to 
switch to lower-cost plans. Other 
studies have found that some 
beneficiaries are not fully aware of the 
financial implications of deferring 
enrollment in drug plans,4 a finding that 
suggests that we could do more to make 
those implications more salient to 
beneficiaries. We invite comments on 
these possibilities and other 
improvements the agency can make, to 
help beneficiaries choose the plans that 
best suit their needs. We also invite 
comment on the type of research that 
might be undertaken to help inform 
future regulatory and programmatic 
improvements and how we can best 
support our partners, such as states, to 
assist them in helping beneficiaries 
enroll in the best possible plans. For 
example, we are interested in assessing 
the impacts of random auto-assignments 
on low-income beneficiaries. To the 
extent that States are interested in 
exploring non-random assignment 
methods, we invite comment on what 
type of information States would find 
most beneficial, including the types of 
data analyses we could potentially 
undertake with the data we already have 
from States who utilize non-random 
assignment methods. 
We also have found that in certain 
cases, we have been limited by existing 
program rules and regulations to 
implement actions that would improve 
sponsoring organization performance. 
Toward this end, we propose provisions 
that would limit the number of plan 
offerings by eliminating duplicative 
bids, and strengthen our program 
participation requirements. 
We are proposing a number of 
additional provisions aimed at 
strengthening existing beneficiary 
protections. For example, we propose to 
strengthen plan transition process 
requirements to ensure maximum 
transparency regarding our expectations 
of Part D plans with respect to enrollees 
transitioning to the plan from other drug 
coverage and to ensure that current 
subregulatory practices are codified in 
regulation. 
We are also proposing another set of 
provisions that are aimed at improving 
payment rules and processes, and 
improving data collection for oversight 
and quality assessment. For example, 
we are proposing to expand the 
collection of prescription drug event 
data that we currently collect for 
research and other non-payment related 
purposes. Collecting these additional 
data, which are currently collected for 
payment purposes, would provide us 
additional information to conduct 
analyses that may be used to improve 
policies and assist in monitoring of Part 
D plan sponsors. 
In addition, we are proposing 
significant new Part D policy in this 
rule. For example, in the area of Part D 
formulary policy, we propose a 
regulatory interpretation of MIPPA 
protected drug categories and classes 
provision in section 176 of MIPPA (Pub. 
L. 110–275) that we previously 
addressed in a January 19, 2009 interim 
final rule with comment period (IFC). 
Based on comments received in 
response to that IFC, we believe that 
interpretation of statutory terms is 
needed. In addition, we believe that 
additional clarification is needed 
relative to the process that we intend to 
utilize to identify the protected 
categories and classes of drugs that must 
be listed on all Part D plan formularies. 
Finally, we propose other provisions 
that are aimed at further clarifying 
existing policy and we make technical 
corrections where needed. For example, 
in some cases, we are addressing topic 
areas that were included in our 2010 
call letter to Part C and D plans, the 
document that outlines policy 
clarifications and reminders for plans 
bidding on plan offerings in the coming 
contract cycle. In the spirit of 
transparency, we have outlined some of 
these clarifications within this rule so to 
ensure the public has a full opportunity 
to comment on our policies. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
In the sections that follow, we discuss 
the proposed changes to the regulations 
in 42 CFR parts 417, 422, 423, and 480 
governing the MA and prescription drug 
benefit programs. To better frame the 
discussion of the specific regulatory 
provisions we are proposing, we have 
structured the preamble narrative by 
topic area rather than by subpart order. 
Accordingly, our proposals address the 
following eight specific goals as 
foreshadowed in the preceding 
introduction:

Several of the proposed revisions and 
clarifications affect both programs. 
Within each section, we have provided 
a chart listing all subject areas that 
contain provisions affecting the Part C 
and D programs and the associated 
regulatory citations that would be 
revised. Please note that in our 
discussion of these provisions, we often 
refer to ‘‘sponsoring organizations’’ to 
refer to both Medicare Advantage 
organizations (MAOs) and Part D 
sponsors. 
A. Changes To Strengthen Our Ability 
To Distinguish for Approval Strong 
Applicants for Part C and D Program 
Participation and To Remove 
Consistently Poor Performers 
This section addresses a number of 
proposals designed to strengthen our 
ability to approve strong applicants and 
remove poor performers in the Part C 
and D programs. Since the 
implementation of revisions to the MA 
and initial implementation of the 
prescription drug programs in January 
2006, we have steadily enhanced our 
ability to measure MAO and PDP 
sponsor performance through efforts 
such as the analysis of data provided 
routinely by sponsors and by our 
contractors, regular review of 
beneficiary complaints, marketing 
surveillance activities, and routine 
audits. This information, combined with 
feedback we have received from 
beneficiary satisfaction surveys, HEDIS 
data, and information from MAOs and 
PDP sponsors themselves, has enabled 
us to develop a clearer sense of what 
constitutes a successful Medicare 
organization capable of providing 
quality Part C and D services to 
beneficiaries. This information has also 
allowed us to identify and take 
appropriate action against organizations 
that are not meeting program 
requirements and not meeting the needs 
of beneficiaries. 
As our understanding of Part C and D 
program operations has deepened over 
the past 4 years, our use of our authority 
to determine which organizations are 
qualified to offer MA and PDP sponsor 
contracts, evaluate their compliance 
with Part C and D requirements, and 
make determinations concerning 
intermediate sanctions, contract 
nonrenewals and contract terminations 
has evolved as well. As set forth below, 
we are proposing changes and 
clarifications to our regulations to make 
certain that all current and potential 
MAOs and PDP sponsors clearly 
understand and can reasonably 
anticipate how we measure sponsor 
performance, determine when there is 
noncompliance, and when enforcement 
actions are warranted. While we are 
pleased that so many organizations have 
elected to participate in the Part C and 
D programs, we have an obligation to 
ensure that only appropriate 
organizations are given the 
responsibility for providing quality 
medical care and drug coverage to 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
Each year, since contract year 2006, 
we have solicited applications from 
organizations seeking to become 
qualified to enter into Part C or D 
sponsor contracts. We received 
hundreds of applications in each of 
those years. To properly manage a 
workload of that size, and to ensure that 
we conduct a fair review of every 
application, we have adopted an 
increasingly standardized, computer- 
based application submission process. 
At the same time, we have also become 
increasingly strict in the application of 
our regulatory authority to limit the 
number and timing of opportunities for 
applicants to resubmit materials to cure 
applications that do not initially 
demonstrate that the applicant meets 
Part C or D requirements. 
Until 2 years ago, applicants may 
have found that we would accept as 
many corrected submissions as the 
applicants needed to make their 
materials (usually documents 
concerning provider/pharmacy 
networks, subcontracting arrangements, 
or risk-bearing licenses) consistent with 
Part C or D requirements. We recognized 
that this was an inefficient process that 
afforded some applicants the 
opportunity to make more re- 
submissions than others and arguably 
enabled less well-prepared and 
qualified applicants to enter the 
program. To improve the fairness of the 
application process, and to reduce the 
burden it imposes on applicants and 
CMS alike, we have, through our 
application instructions issued over the 
last 3 years, clarified to all applicants 
that we will only provide three 
opportunities to submit an approvable 
contract qualification application to 
CMS: The initial solicitation response, 
one courtesy opportunity to correct any 
identified deficiencies, and a final 
opportunity during the 10-day cure 
period provided for specifically in the 
regulations. 
Some organizations have expressed 
surprise during the last 2 years at our 
use of our authority to impose strict 
deadlines and standards of review on 
applications for qualification as an 
MAO or PDP sponsor. To reduce the 
opportunity for confusion about the 
application process, we are proposing 
some regulatory clarifications in 
furtherance of our goal of using a fair 
and efficient process for ensuring that 
only truly qualified organizations are 
offered Part C or D organization 
contracts. These provisions, described 
in greater detail below, include 
requiring applicants to demonstrate that 
they meet all (not a substantial number) 
of the Part C and D program 
requirements, prohibiting applicants 
from submitting additional curing 
materials after the expiration of the ten- 
day period following their receipt of a 
notice of intent to deny their 
application, and requiring applicants to 
submit a nonbinding notice of intent to 
apply for a Part C or D contract. 
Organizations should be aware that 
we will continue to exercise our 
authority to consider an organization’s 
past Part C or D contract performance in 
evaluating whether it should be afforded 
the opportunity to obtain additional 
contracts or to serve a larger portion of 
the Medicare beneficiary population. 
Additionally, sponsoring organizations 
should be aware that we rely on data to 
evaluate compliance with program 
requirements in a number of ways. For 
example, we use data to evaluate 
adherence to requirements in the MMA 
statute or the Part C and D regulations 
(for example, retail pharmacy access). 
We also use data to evaluate adherence 
to the requirements outlined in our 
manual chapters and other guidance (for 
example, customer and provider call 
center performance standards). Finally, 
we conduct outlier analysis by 
comparing the performance across all 
organizations on a particular Part C or 
D requirement to identify organizations 
that appear to be poor performers. The 
most notable example of this kind of 
analysis is reflected in our performance 
metrics (that is, the Medicare Part D 
Plan Ratings). These ratings represent an 
effort to make additional information 
available to the public regarding the 
price and quality of services for which 
Medicare makes payments. The Plan

Ratings are located on the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plan Finder (MPDPF) 
Tool at (http://www.Medicare.gov) and 
are designed to provide a clear 
differentiation of the various Plan 
offerings to beneficiaries. Organizations 
receiving less than ‘‘good’’ ratings in 
any category should anticipate 
communication from us. Another 
example is our review of data in the 
Complaints Tracking Module (CTM), 
which can be a particularly strong 
indicator of a sponsor’s inability to 
perform a required Part C or D function. 
An abnormally high complaint rate for 
a particular sponsor will likely prompt 
us to investigate other sources of 
information to determine whether the 
organization is complying with specific 
Part C or D requirements. 
Our efforts are aimed at making 
certain that we have well-functioning 
MAOs and PDP sponsors administering 
Part C and D benefits on our behalf. Just 
as we have become more sophisticated 
in our analysis of sponsor applications 
and compliance, we also continue to 
review our sanction and contract 
termination authority to ensure that we 
pursue actions when there is sufficient 
basis to support them. For example, we 
have developed an annual process for 
analyzing sponsor performance during 
the preceding contract year. We review 
each sponsor’s compliance history, 
including CMS-issued compliance 
notices, audit results, and performance 
ratings (for example, star ratings) to 
develop a full picture of that sponsor’s 
ability to deliver Part C and D services 
to its members. If that picture indicates 
that a particular sponsor has a 
significant pattern of poor performance 
or even isolated incidences of 
noncompliance with crucial operational 
requirements (for example, enrollment 
processing), we will consider 
termination or nonrenewal of the 
contract of that sponsor. 
With the clarifications we are 
proposing to the Part C and D 
regulations through this proposed rule 
and the background provided in this 
preamble section, MAOs and PDP 
sponsors should now be fully aware that 
we will continue to apply stricter 
scrutiny to sponsor qualifications and 
contract performance as our analytical 
capabilities and understanding of 
industry best practices improves. As the 
Part C and D programs have now 
reached a certain level of maturity and 
organizations’ strong interest in 
participating in the programs has been 
established, it is appropriate for us to 
use the authority and evidence at our 
disposal to make certain that beneficiary 
plan choices are characterized more by 
their quality than their quantity. These 
provisions are described in detail in 
Table 1.

1. Require Notice of Intent To Apply 
Under Part C and D Within the 
Application Requirements (§ 422.501 
and § 423.502) 
Subpart K of part 422 and subpart K 
of part 423 set forth the requirements for 
contracts with MA Organizations and 
Part D sponsors including application 
procedures. Section 1871(a)(1) of the 
Act authorizes us to prescribe such 
regulations as may be necessary to carry 
out the administration of the Medicare 
program. We propose using that 
authority to establish an administrative 
requirement for both the Part C and D 
programs related to the submission to us 
of applications to qualify as MA and 
PDP sponsor contractors. 
Beginning with the applications for 
the 2009 contract year, the Medicare 
Advantage, Part D Prescription Drug 
benefit, and Employer/Union-Only 
Group Waiver Plan (Direct Contract or 
‘‘800 Series’’) sponsor applications are

54641 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
submitted via a paperless process. Each 
application is completed through the 
CMS Health Plan Management System 
(HPMS). As a result of the fully 
electronic submission process and 
restrictions on access to HPMS, every 
applicant must complete a Notice of 
Intent to Apply as described in the 
HPMS memo dated October 10, 2008. 
This includes current contractors 
seeking to expand their organization’s 
service area, and current contractors 
adding a Special Needs Plan (SNP) or an 
Employer Group/Union-Sponsored 
Waiver Plan (EGWP) to their existing 
contract. 
The Notice of Intent to Apply 
provides us with critical information for 
generating a pending contract number 
and providing User ID connectivity. 
Submitting a Notice of Intent to Apply 
does not bind that organization to 
submit an application for the following 
year. However, without a pending 
contract number and completed CMS 
User ID connectivity, an organization 
will not be able to access the 
appropriate modules in HPMS to 
complete the application materials. We 
propose codifying in § 422.501 and 
§ 423.502 our existing guidance that 
initial applicants and existing 
contractors seeking to expand complete 
a nonbinding Notice of Intent to Apply. 
2. Application Requirements 
(§ 422.501(c) and § 423.502(c)) and 
Evaluation and Determination 
Procedures for Determining Whether 
Applicants Are Qualified for a Contract 
Under Parts C and D (§ 422.502 and 
§ 423.503) 
Subpart K of Part 422 and subpart K 
of Part 423 set forth the requirements for 
contracts with MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors, respectively, including 
application procedures. Section 1860D– 
12(b)(3) of the Act states that we must 
apply certain specified provisions of 
section 1857 of the Act including the 
procedures for termination in section 
1857(h) of the Act in the same manner 
as they apply to contracts under section 
1857(a) of the Act. Therefore, we are 
making a single proposal that applies to 
both MA organizations and Part D 
sponsors related to our application 
evaluation procedures and appeals of 
our determinations regarding 
applications. 
During the first four years of the 
Medicare Advantage and Part D 
programs, several unsuccessful 
applicants contested our denial of their 
applications for MA organization or Part 
D sponsor contracts. At hearings, some 
of those applicants were successful in 
arguing that the regulations were not 
clear in stating that an applicant needed 
to demonstrate that it met all program 
requirements to qualify for a contract. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to revise 
§ 422.502 and § 423.503 to make it 
explicit that we will approve only those 
applications that demonstrate that they 
meet all (not substantially all) Part C 
and D program requirements. 
The application requirements and 
evaluation and determination 
procedures for MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors are set forth in subpart 
K of Parts 422 and 423, respectively. 
The application process in each 
instance requires an applicant to submit 
for CMS review a combination of 
attestations that it will comply with 
stated program requirements, as well as 
contracts with organizations the 
applicant has contracted with to 
perform key Part C or D functions, 
evidence of the applicant’s risk-bearing 
licenses, and data documenting that the 
applicant can provide its members 
access to Part C and D services 
consistent with the programs’ 
requirements. As we have proposed to 
clarify at § 422.501(c)(1) and (2), 
§ 422.502(a)(2), § 423.502(c)(1) and (2), 
and § 423.503(a)(2), we require that 
applicants demonstrate that they meet 
all requirements outlined in the MA 
organization and Part D sponsor 
applications. 
Under the current regulations at 
§ 422.502(a)(1) and § 423.503 (a)(1), we 
evaluate an entity’s application on the 
basis of information contained in the 
application itself and any additional 
information that we obtain through 
onsite visits, publicly available 
information, and any other appropriate 
procedures. We propose to simplify and 
clarify the process by modifying 
§ 422.502(a)(1) and § 423.503(a)(1) and 
limiting the evaluation of an entity’s 
application to information contained in 
the application and any additional 
information that we obtain through 
onsite visits. Limiting our review to this 
information ensures that we will afford 
all applicants (numbering in the 
hundreds each of the last four years) a 
fair and consistent review of their 
qualifications. Organizations can be 
assured that we will not consider 
additional sources of information 
regarding one applicant’s qualifications 
that we do not consider for others. 
We are also proposing a clarification 
of our authority to decline to consider 
application materials submitted after the 
expiration of the 10-day period 
following our issuance of a notice of 
intent to deny an organization’s contract 
qualification application. Under 
§ 422.502(c) and § 423.503(c), we notify 
applicants of our determination on the 
application and the basis for the 
determination. If the applicant does not 
appear qualified to contract as an MA 
organization or Part D sponsor and has 
not provided enough information to 
permit us to evaluate the application, 
the applicant receives a notice of intent 
to deny the application and a summary 
for the basis for the finding. As provided 
in § 422.502(c)(2) and § 423.503(c)(2), 
within 10 days from the date of the 
notice, the applicant can respond in 
writing to the issues or other matters 
that were the basis for our findings and 
revise its application to correct any 
deficiencies. 
The purpose of the proposed 
regulatory change is to clarify that 
information submitted after 10 days 
from the notice will under no 
circumstances be reviewed for the 
purpose of approving an application. 
Further, consistent with the proposed 
revisions to § 422.650(b)(2) and 
§ 423.660(b)(2), which are discussed 
elsewhere in this proposed rule, the 
applicant would not be permitted to 
submit additional revised application 
material to the Hearing Officer for 
review should the applicant elect to 
appeal the denial of its application. To 
allow for the submission and review of 
such information as part of the hearing 
would, in effect, extend the deadline for 
submitting an approvable application. 
Moreover, the proposed change would 
further clarify the standard for the 
disposition of applications for which 
either revisions are not provided within 
the 10 days or are inadequate. 
Specifically, we propose to clarify 
§ 422.502(c)(2) and § 423.503(c)(2) by 
adding a new paragraph (iii) to establish 
that if we do not receive a revised 
application within 10 days from the 
date of the intent to deny notice, or if 
after timely submission of a revised 
application the applicant still appears 
unqualified to contract as an MA 
organization or Part D sponsor and/or 
has not provided enough information to 
allow us to evaluate the application, we 
will deny the application. 
3. Deny Contract Qualification 
Applications Based on Past Contract 
Performance (§ 422.750 and § 423.750) 
As described in § 422.502(b) and 
§ 423.503(b), we may deny an 
application based on the applicant’s 
failure to comply with the terms of a 
prior contract with CMS even if the 
applicant currently meets all of the 
application requirements. However, we 
propose to modify § 422.502(b) and 
§ 423.503(b) to state that we will review 
past performance across all of the 
contracts held by the applicant. The 
provision as currently drafted mentions 
a ‘‘prior contract’’ with CMS. Today, 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 17:49 Oct 21, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22OCP2.SGM 22OCP2dc

54642 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
contracts are ‘‘evergreen’’ and some 
organizations hold multiple MA and/or 
PDP sponsor contracts; therefore the 
concept of ‘‘prior contract’’ is outdated, 
as the prior performance issues could 
have occurred in any other contract 
currently or formerly held by an 
applicant. Therefore, we propose to 
revise the language in § 423.503(b) and 
§ 422.502(b) to refer to ‘‘any current or 
prior contract’’ held by the organization, 
instead of the current language referring 
to a ‘‘previous year’s contract.’’ We also 
propose to clarify that the period that 
will be examined for past performance 
problems be limited to those identified 
by us during the 14 months prior to the 
date by which organizations must 
submit contract qualification 
applications to CMS. Fourteen months 
covers the time period from the start of 
the previous contract year through the 
time that applications are received for 
the next contract year. 
Indicia of performance deficiencies 
that might lead us to conclude that an 
organization has failed to comply with 
a current or prior contract include, but 
are not limited to, poor performance 
ratings as displayed on the Medicare 
Options Compare and MPDPF web sites; 
receipt of requests for corrective action 
plans (CAPs) unrelated to an audit (as 
these types of CAPs generally involve 
direct beneficiary harm); and receipt of 
one or more other types of 
noncompliance notices from CMS (for 
example, notices of noncompliance or 
warning letters). 
Additionally, as indicated by the 
changes to § 422.503(b), § 422.508(c), 
§ 423.504(b), and § 423.508(e), we 
consider withdrawal of Part C or D 
operations from some or all of an 
organization’s newly contracted service 
area prior to the start of a benefit year 
(through mutual termination or 
otherwise) an indication of poor 
performance. Such a situation can arise 
when, for example, an organization, 
after it has signed its Medicare contract 
for the upcoming program year, loses a 
contract with a significant number or 
type of providers, jeopardizing its 
ability to provide its members adequate 
access to services. Also, an organization 
may suddenly face financial difficulties 
that threaten its ability to offer the 
benefit packages approved by CMS 
throughout the upcoming contract year. 
In such instances, we could simply 
leave the contract in place and take 
enforcement actions against the 
organization. Under such an approach, 
we would knowingly be permitting 
beneficiaries to remain enrolled with an 
organization that cannot effectively 
deliver the benefit. Instead, we act(s) in 
the best interests of the beneficiaries by 
agreeing with the organization to 
terminate its contract and work(s) with 
the organization to make certain that 
beneficiaries receive uninterrupted 
access to Medicare services through 
another MA organization, PDP sponsor, 
or original Medicare. But for our acting 
to protect beneficiaries by agreeing to 
the contact termination, the 
organization would have faced 
significant compliance and enforcement 
actions once its failure to comply with 
program requirements became apparent. 
Also, the organization’s failure to 
conduct the proper due diligence on its 
contracted provider network or its 
finances represents itself a significant 
failure to have in place the 
administrative capability to operate a 
Medicare benefit plan worthy of 
compliance and enforcement actions. 
Accordingly, we believe(s) it is 
appropriate to consider an 
organization’s withdrawal from its 
contract prior to the start of the benefit 
year to be a strong indication of poor 
performance worthy of our 
consideration under § 422.750 and 
§ 423.750. 
We will review performance in 
accordance with these examples and 
other evidence of noncompliance, and 
will deny applications for initial 
contracts and service area expansions 
on the basis of noncompliant past 
performance. By specifically providing 
these examples and clarifying that we 
intend to exercise this authority, we 
believe that organizations will be 
motivated to enhance their compliance 
operations in order to avoid being out of 
compliance with program requirements, 
and this will significantly deter 
noncompliance leading to improved 
overall performance of organizations in 
the Part C and D programs. 
4. Use of Data To Evaluate Continued 
Ability To Act as a Qualified 
Sponsoring Organization Under Parts C 
and D (§ 422.504, and § 423.505) 
Sections 1857(e)(1) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(D) of the Act provide broad 
authority for the Secretary to add terms 
to the contracts with MA and Part D 
sponsors including terms that require 
the sponsor to provide the Secretary 
‘‘with such information * * * as the 
Secretary may find necessary and 
appropriate.’’ Under that authority, we 
established § 422.516 and § 423.514, 
Reporting Requirements. Consistent 
with sections 1857(a) and 1860D– 
12(b)(1) of the Act, we established that 
we will oversee an MA organization’s 
and Part D sponsor’s continued 
compliance with Part C and Part D 
requirements under § 422.502(d)(1) and 
§ 423.503(d)(1). 
Some of the data acquired through 
§ 422.516 and § 423.514 are used for the 
purpose of monitoring an organization’s 
or sponsor’s continued compliance with 
MA and/or Part D requirements. For 
example, under § 423.514(a)(5), Part D 
sponsors must have an effective 
procedure to develop, compile, 
evaluate, and report to CMS particular 
matters, such as low income subsidy 
(LIS) contract data, that we require. At 
the contract level, the sponsor’s LIS data 
is compared to our LIS data and a match 
rate is calculated. Under our guidance, 
the match rate between our data and the 
sponsor’s should exceed 95 percent. 
Sponsors who fail to exceed the 95 
percent match rate are notified of their 
noncompliance and are expected to 
come into compliance with Part D 
instructions. In some instances, we may 
use an outlier analysis to determine a 
MA organization’s or Part D sponsor’s 
performance relative to industry 
standards established by the 
performance of all the other 
organizations and sponsors as described 
earlier in the preamble in our discussion 
of the development of our policies 
concerning the awarding, monitoring, 
and enforcement of Medicare contracts. 
For example, Part D plans report 
grievance data to CMS. We conduct 
outlier analysis to identify plans with 
the highest numbers of reported 
grievances for the purpose of identifying 
plans needing some type of compliance 
action. To conduct these types of outlier 
analysis, we usually perform the 
following steps: 
• Develop a data distribution—data 
values ordered from low to high. 
• Determine the maximum and 
minimum data values. 
• Determine the range (maximum– 
minimum). 
• Determine the outlier threshold— 
When conducting an outlier analysis, 
we typically identify sponsors typically 
in the highest (or lowest) 5 percent of 
comparable sponsors (for example, 
compare PDPs to PDPs). 
We also use the Performance Metrics 
(Plan Star Ratings), some of which are 
determined by relative ranking, for 
oversight and monitoring purposes to 
ensure plan quality. As stated in the 
2009 Call Letter, organizations and 
sponsors with less than ‘‘good’’ ratings 
should expect to be the subject of our 
monitoring and compliance actions. 
Likewise, if after an analysis of data 
submitted under § 422.516 or § 423.514 
an organization’s or sponsor’s 
performance is found to be an outlier 
based on relative ranking, the 
organization or sponsor may be 
considered out of compliance with MA 
and Part D requirements.

54643 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
We propose to add paragraphs 
§ 422.504(m)(1) and (2) and 
§ 423.505(n)(1) and (2) to make explicit 
our existing authority to find 
organizations or sponsors out of 
compliance with MA and/or Part D 
requirements when the organization’s or 
sponsor’s performance fails to meet 
performance standards articulated in 
statutes, regulations, and guidance or 
when an organization’s or sponsor’s 
performance represents an outlier 
relative to the performance of other 
organizations or sponsors. 
5. Compliance Programs Under Parts C 
and D (§ 422.503(b)(4)(vi) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)) 
Section 1857(a) of the Act provides 
the Secretary with the authority to enter 
into contracts with MA organizations 
and section 1860D–12(b)(1) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
authority to enter into contracts with 
PDP sponsors. The current regulatory 
provisions provide that any entity 
seeking to contract as an MA 
organization or PDPsponsor must have 
administrative and management 
arrangements satisfactory to us as 
demonstrated by (among other 
requirements) having a compliance plan 
that consists of seven basic elements. 
These seven elements of the compliance 
plan outline fundamental requirements 
such as written policies and procedures, 
a compliance officer and committee that 
is accountable to senior management, 
effective compliance training and 
communication, enforcement of 
disciplinary standards, and procedures 
for internal monitoring and auditing and 
ensuring prompt responses to detected 
offenses. In addition, a compliance plan 
must include measures to detect, 
correct, and prevent fraud, waste, and 
abuse. 
Compliance programs have long been 
recognized as key to achieving 
adherence with contract requirements 
and to protecting against fraud, waste, 
and abuse. The recent focus on the 
importance of these programs has been 
heightened not only by CMS through 
our ongoing audit and oversight efforts 
but also by several of our oversight 
bodies. For example, over the last 
several years, the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) and the 
Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) have each focused specific 
oversight efforts on MA organizations’ 
and PDP sponsors’ compliance 
programs and have requested that we 
take actions to evaluate and oversee 
these programs to ensure entities have 
effective programs in place. Similarly, 
like the Medicare Part C and D 
programs, other state programs, 
including the State of New York 
Medicaid program, now require 
effective compliance programs as a 
condition of participation. 
Our recent experience is that some 
sponsoring organizations have instituted 
a compliance plan that appears to meet 
the minimum requirements of our 
regulations, but may not have an 
effective compliance program. Other 
sponsoring organizations seem to 
legitimately grapple with how best to 
implement the regulatory requirements 
within their organization and which 
particular actions on their part will meet 
our requirements. 
We propose to stress the importance 
of sponsoring organization’s 
implementing and maintaining robust 
compliance programs by modifying the 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi) to explicitly provide 
clarification as to what will constitute 
an ‘‘effective’’ compliance program prior 
to contracting with CMS. We are also 
proposing to further clarify existing 
policy by modifying current language 
and/or adding language in support of 
each of the elements of an effective 
compliance plan in order to assist 
sponsoring organizations with 
implementing more effective 
compliance programs. 
In the first element concerning the 
overall requirement to have written 
policies and procedures, we are 
proposing to further clarify existing 
policy by adding language at 
§ 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(A) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(A) that these policies 
must describe compliance expectations 
as embodied in the standards of 
conduct, implement the operations of 
the compliance program, provide 
guidance to others, identify how to 
communicate compliance issues to 
compliance personnel, describe how 
compliance issues are investigated and 
resolved and include a policy of non- 
intimidation and non-retaliation. 
In the second element concerning the 
requirement to have a compliance 
officer and committee accountable to 
senior management, we are proposing to 
further clarify existing policy by adding 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(B) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(B) that the 
compliance officer and committee must 
periodically report directly to the 
governing body (for example, Board of 
Directors) and that body must be 
knowledgeable about the compliance 
program and exercise reasonable 
oversight over the implementation and 
effectiveness of the program. The 
governing body’s direct involvement 
with and oversight of the compliance 
program is instrumental in fulfilling this 
requirement and achieving an effective 
compliance program. Our recent 
experience with some sponsoring 
organizations has indicated that Boards 
of Directors may not be sufficiently 
aware or may have limited information 
about their organization’s compliance 
programs or compliance issues. In 
deciding how often the compliance 
officer and committee must directly 
report to the Board of Directors, 
sponsoring organizations must consider 
many factors, including but not limited 
to: the size of the organization, the 
number of compliance problems, 
whether there is an emergency that calls 
for the Board’s attention, and whether 
the sponsoring organization is under an 
intermediate sanction. Our proposed 
language further clarifies existing policy 
related to this requirement for senior 
management to be sufficiently engaged, 
informed, and to exercise appropriate 
governance over the organization’s 
compliance program. 
In the third element concerning the 
requirement to have effective training 
and education, we are proposing to 
further clarify existing policy by adding 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(C) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(C) that includes 
several key groups and individuals (the 
chief executive or other senior 
administrator, managers, and governing 
body members) among the sponsoring 
organization’s employees that are 
required to have compliance training 
and education. Because these employees 
have specific governing and oversight 
responsibilities, we believe it is 
important to clarify these requirements. 
We are proposing to further clarify 
existing policy by adding language that 
also clarifies that this training must 
occur at a minimum annually and must 
be made a part of the orientation for a 
new employee, new first tier, 
downstream and related entities, and 
new appointment to a chief executive, 
manager or governing body member. 
In the December 5, 2007 Federal 
Register, we published the ‘‘Medicare 
Program; Revisions to the Medicare 
Advantage and Part D Prescription Drug 
Contract Determinations, Appeals and 
Intermediate Sanctions Process’’ final 
rule (72 FR 68700). In the December 5, 
2007 final rule, we established that 
compliance plans for sponsoring 
organizations must include training and 
education and effective lines of 
communication between the compliance 
officer and the sponsoring 
organization’s employees, managers, 
and directors as well as their first tier, 
downstream, and related entities. 
Since publication of the December 5, 
2007 final rule, it has become apparent 
that application of training about fraud,

54644 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
waste, and abuse to the MA 
organizations’ first tier, downstream, 
and related entities may be redundant of 
the certification made when these 
entities submit enrollment applications 
to become Medicare physician and non- 
physician practitioners, institutional 
providers, and suppliers. Medicare 
practitioner enrollment applications 
require that applicants certify to having 
read and understood the Penalties for 
Falsifying Information contained in the 
application and that the applicant will 
not present or cause to present a false 
claim to Medicare. Section 422.204(b)(3) 
requires that basic benefits offered by 
MA organizations be offered through 
providers and suppliers who meet 
applicable requirements of Title XVIII 
and Part A of Title XI of the Act. 
Providers of services must have a 
provider agreement with us that permits 
them to provide services under original 
Medicare. Requiring an additional 
fraud, waste, and abuse certification as 
was clarified in the response to 
comments in the December 5, 2007 final 
rule imposes an additional unnecessary 
burden on these Medicare providers. 
Therefore, we are proposing to modify 
this paragraph to state that providers 
who have met this requirement through 
enrollment into the Medicare program 
are deemed to have met this training 
and education requirement. More 
specifically, we are proposing to clarify 
existing policy by adding language at 
§ 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(C) specifying that 
MA organizations whose first tier, 
downstream, and related entities have 
met the fraud, waste and abuse 
certification requirements are deemed to 
have met the training and educational 
requirements for fraud, waste, and 
abuse. We are not proposing similar 
deeming language at 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(C) because these 
certification requirements do not 
currently apply to Part D first tier, 
downstream, or related entities. 
The current requirement for training 
in fraud, waste, and abuse of first tier, 
downstream, and related entities creates 
another potential problem. A particular 
pharmacy or other provider may 
contract with dozens of MA or PDP 
plans, each of which is required by the 
existing language, read literally, to 
provide the required training to the 
pharmacy, or other provider, and its 
staff. Clearly, we do not intend to 
require duplicative training. We 
therefore seek comment on whether or 
how best to rephrase the existing 
language to clarify this point, while still 
ensuring that our requirement is met 
with respect to each first tier, 
downstream, and related entity. One 
option might be that the plan sponsor 
‘‘assures’’ or ‘‘obtain an assurance’’ that 
the first tier, downstream, and related 
entity has received such training, but 
this leaves open the issue of who would 
then actually provide the needed 
training. We understand that some plans 
are arranging fraud, waste, and abuse 
collaborative training efforts and we 
welcome this. Another option might be 
to leave existing language unchanged, 
but issue interpretive guidance on this 
point. We request workable suggestions 
to assure that our objective is met, while 
eliminating unnecessary duplication. 
In the fourth element concerning the 
requirement to have effective lines of 
communication, we are proposing to 
further clarify existing policy by adding 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(D) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(D) that requires that 
these lines of communication are 
confidential and accessible to all and 
allow for compliance issues to be 
reported anonymously and in good faith 
as issues are identified. 
In the fifth element concerning the 
requirement to have enforcement of 
standards through well-publicized 
disciplinary guidelines, we are 
proposing to further clarify existing 
policy by adding language at 
§ 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(E) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(E) that more 
specifically describes that these 
guidelines must be implemented to 
include policies that articulate 
expectations for reporting issues and 
their resolution, identify noncompliance 
or unethical behavior, and provide for 
timely, consistent and effective 
enforcement of the standards when 
noncompliance or unethical behavior is 
detected. 
In the sixth element concerning the 
requirement to have procedures for 
internal monitoring and auditing, we are 
proposing to further clarify existing 
policy by modifying the current 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(F) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(F) to more 
specifically describe that an effective 
system for routine monitoring and 
identification of compliance risks 
includes internal monitoring and audits 
and, as appropriate, external audits, in 
order to evaluate the organization’s 
compliance with our requirements and 
overall effectiveness of the compliance 
program. These audits should include 
the sponsoring organization’s first tier 
entities. 
In the seventh element concerning the 
requirement to have procedures for 
ensuring prompt response to detected 
offenses and development of CAPs, we 
are proposing to further clarify existing 
policy by modifying the current 
language at § 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(G) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(G) to more 
specifically describe the 
implementation of a system for 
promptly responding to compliance 
issues as they are raised, investigating 
potential compliance problems 
identified in the course of self- 
evaluations and audits, correcting such 
problems promptly and thoroughly to 
reduce the potential for recurrence and 
ensuring ongoing compliance with our 
requirements. 
6. Network Adequacy of Coordinated 
Care and Network-Based Private Fee-for- 
Service Plans Under Part C (§ 422.112) 
Section 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act 
establishes that an organization offering 
an MA plan may select the providers 
from whom the benefits under the plan 
are provided so long as the organization 
makes such benefits available and 
accessible to each individual electing 
the plan within the plan service area 
with reasonable promptness and in a 
manner which ensures continuity in the 
provision of benefits. The requirements 
of section 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act are 
implemented at § 422.112(a)(1), which 
provides that a coordinated care plan 
must maintain a network of appropriate 
providers that is sufficient to provide 
adequate access to covered services to 
meet the needs of the population served. 
To determine if a proposed health 
care delivery network of an MA plan 
adequately makes health care services 
available and accessible, it has been our 
practice when initially approving and 
when reviewing to compare the 
proposed network with the prevailing 
community patterns of health care 
delivery in the service area of the plan. 
We have also used as a rough 
benchmark a maximum access to 
providers of 30 minutes/30 miles. We 
would be interested in comments 
regarding our proposed criteria for 
developing standards for the network 
adequacy of MA plans. We are in the 
process of developing an automated 
system for reviewing network adequacy 
on a continuing basis based on the 
elements that we determine define 
community patterns of health care 
delivery. In this system, MAOs offering 
MA plans would submit data to us 
through the HPMS system specifying 
the access and availability of its 
proposed provider networks. This 
information would be analyzed and 
compared through electronic mapping 
software against our access standards for 
a given geographical area to confirm 
whether the proposed provider network 
meets our access and availability 
standards. 
Given that we are developing this 
automated system, we believe it is

54645 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
appropriate to more explicitly define 
how we determine network adequacy. 
To that end, we propose using our 
authority under section 1852(d)(1)(A) of 
the Act to include more specific criteria 
that we will apply in defining 
community patterns of care in order to 
determine if a network offered by an 
MA plan meets Medicare access and 
availability requirements. We also 
propose applying these more specific 
criteria to the proposed provider 
networks of both coordinated care and 
PFFS plans that are intending to meet 
Medicare access to services 
requirements, in whole or in part, 
through a network of direct contracting 
providers. 
Our operational experience has 
demonstrated that the concept of 
community patterns of health care 
delivery provides a useful industry 
standard benchmark for measuring a 
proposed provider network because it 
allows for varying geographical and 
regional conditions to be taken into 
consideration. For example, plans 
operating in rural rather than urban 
counties will necessarily face different 
market conditions in terms of the 
number and specialties of providers 
available and their willingness to 
contract with the plan. 
However, given the lack of specificity 
regarding how we determine if a given 
provider network meets Medicare access 
and availability requirements in 
§ 422.112(a)(1) as currently drafted, we 
believe it is important to amend that 
section of our regulations to describe 
how we will include the elements of the 
prevailing community patterns of health 
care delivery in its evaluations of 
provider networks. We believe the 
proposed changes will make the 
standards of community patterns of care 
more transparent and consistent across 
the country. The proposed changes are 
consistent with the elements that will be 
used by the automated system we are 
developing to assess network adequacy. 
Specifically, we propose to add 
paragraph (a)(10) to amend § 422.112 to 
specify the factors comprising 
community patterns of health care 
delivery that we will use as a 
benchmark in evaluating a proposed 
MA plan health care delivery network. 
Under proposed § 422.112(a)(10), these 
factors would include, but not be 
limited to— 
• The number and geographical 
distribution of eligible health care 
providers available to potentially 
contract with an MAO to furnish plan 
covered services within the proposed 
service area of the MA plans; 
• The prevailing market conditions in 
the service area of the MA plan. 
Specifically, the number and 
distribution of health care providers 
contracting with other health care plans 
(both commercial and Medicare) 
operating in the service area of the plan; 
• Whether the service area is 
comprised of rural or urban areas or 
some combination of the two; 
• Whether the MA plan’s proposed 
provider network meets Medicare time 
and distance standards for member 
access to health care providers 
including specialties; and 
• Other factors that we determine to 
be relevant in setting a standard for an 
acceptable health care delivery network 
in a particular service area. 
We plan to further define through 
subregulatory guidance (for example the 
Call Letter) how we will operationalize 
these provisions. For example, as 
previously noted, we have in the past 
used as a rough benchmark a maximum 
access to provider ratio of 30 minutes/ 
30 miles to determine ‘‘network 
adequacy.’’ We solicit comment on 
whether these regulatory provisions are 
sufficiently clear, and whether 
clarification should be provided through 
regulation or subregulatory guidance, 
such as the annual Call Letter. 
7. Deemable Program Requirements 
Under Parts C and D (§ 422.156(b)(7), 
§ 422.156(f), § 423.165(b), and 
§ 423.165(f)) 
We are proposing to clarify which 
regulatory requirements are ‘‘deemable’’ 
for MA organizations that offer 
prescription drug benefit programs. 
Sections 1852(e)(4) and 1860D–4(j) of 
the Act provide that we can authorize 
approved accrediting organizations 
(AOs) to accredit MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors, and deem such entities 
to have met our program requirements, 
as long as the standards the AO uses to 
evaluate the performance of the 
organizations and plan sponsors meet or 
exceed our own performance 
assessment standards. The statute also 
dictates which performance standards 
we can allow an AO to evaluate in the 
place of CMS. Those standards that we 
permit AOs to survey for, rather than 
CMS, are referred to as ‘‘deemable’’ 
program requirements. 
The current regulations state that the 
Part D prescription drug benefit program 
is a deemable requirement for MA 
organizations that offer prescription 
drug benefits. We believe that this 
language does not precisely reflect the 
requirements that are listed as deemable 
in the statute. Therefore, we are 
proposing to modify § 422.156(b)(7) to 
refer to the list of deemable 
requirements for Part D sponsors set out 
at § 423.165(b)(1) through (b)(3), as we 
believe this cross reference is a more 
accurate reflection of the specific 
program requirements that are deemable 
per section 1860D–4(j) of the Act for MA 
organizations that offer prescription 
drug benefits. 
In § 422.156(f) and § 423.165(f), we 
are proposing to clarify the extent of our 
authority under the deeming program. 
The regulation currently states that we 
retain our authority to initiate 
enforcement actions against MA 
organizations or Part D sponsors that we 
determine, on the basis of its own 
survey, or the survey of an accrediting 
organization, no longer meet the 
Medicare requirements for which 
deemed status was granted. We believe 
that this language is unduly limiting 
and does not comport with the statute. 
Section 1852(e)(4)(D) of the Act states 
nothing in section 1852(e)(4) of the Act 
shall be construed to limit our authority 
under section 1857 of the Act, which 
encompasses much more than 
enforcement actions. Therefore, we are 
proposing to revise the language in 
§ 422.156(f) and § 423.165(f) to more 
closely match the authority granted by 
the statute, which is to state that we 
retain authority to impose intermediate 
sanctions and civil money penalties 
(CMPs), initiate contract terminations, 
and perform evaluations and audits of 
an organization’s records, facilities and 
operations, notwithstanding the 
deeming provisions. 
We plan to further define through 
subregulatory guidance how we will 
operationalize these provisions. We 
solicit comment on whether these 
regulatory provisions provide sufficient 
clarity. If not, we solicit comment on 
whether clarification should be 
provided through regulation or 
subregulatory guidance, such as the 
annual Call Letter. 
In § 423.165(b), we are proposing to 
delete paragraph (b)(4) from the items 
listed as deemable program 
requirements. The regulation currently 
states that a program to protect against 
fraud, waste, and abuse is a deemable 
program requirement. We believe that 
including this in the list of deemable 
requirements was an error, as the statute 
does not list a program to protect against 
fraud, waste, and abuse as one of the 
programmatic areas that is deemable. 
Therefore, we are proposing to remove 
programs to protect against fraud, waste, 
and abuse from the list of deemable 
programmatic requirements.

8. Modify the Corrective Action Plan 
(CAP) Process as it Relates to 
Procedures for Termination and 
Nonrenewal of a Part C or D Contract by 
CMS (§ 422.506(b)(3), § 422.510(c)(1), 
§ 423.507(b)(3), and § 423.509(c)(1)) 
Sections 1857(h) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide that the 
Secretary may terminate a contract with 
an MA organization or PDP sponsor in 
accordance with formal investigation 
and compliance procedures established 
by the Secretary under which the 
sponsoring organizations are to be 
provided with reasonable notice and 
opportunity for hearing and reasonable 
opportunity to develop and implement 
a CAP to correct the deficiencies that 
were the initial basis for termination 
prior to terminating the contract. These 
statutory provisions further provide, 
under sections 1857(h)(2) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act, that these 
procedures shall not apply if the 
Secretary determines that a delay in 
termination, resulting from compliance 
with these procedures prior to 
termination, would pose an imminent 
and serious risk to the health of 
individuals enrolled with the 
sponsoring organization. 
Under this statutory authority, we 
issued the December 5, 2007 final rule 
that detailed timeframes for the 
development and implementation of 
CAPs prior to an issuance of a notice of 
intent to terminate or nonrenew a CMS 
contract. These regulations, codified at 
§ 422.506(b)(3), § 422.510(c)(1), 
§ 423.507(b)(3), and § 423.509(c)(1), 
currently require us to provide 
sponsoring organizations with 45 
calendar days from the date of our 
request, to develop and submit a CAP 
prior to CMS issuing a notice of intent 
to terminate or nonrenew a contract to 
the sponsoring organization. In 
addition, the current regulations 
provide that if, after our review, this 
first CAP submission is determined 
unacceptable, the sponsoring 
organization will be provided an 
additional 30 calendar days to submit a 
revised CAP to CMS for review. Under 
these current provisions, once we 
determine the CAP acceptable, we are 
then required to notify the sponsoring 
organization of the deadline by which 
the CAP must be fully implemented. We 
must then assess whether successful 
implementation occurred. It is only after 
exercising these protracted procedures 
that we may issue a notice of intent to 
terminate or nonrenew a contract to the 
sponsoring organization in instances 
when we determine that successful 
implementation of the CAP has not 
occurred and/or the deficiencies have 
not been fully corrected. 
Since the implementation of the 
December 5, 2007 final rule, we have 
determined that some modification is 
required of our overall approach to our 
compliance procedures, particularly in 
situations when serious and/or repeated 
compliance deficiencies are identified. 
More specifically, we have concluded 
that the compliance procedures and 
timeframes set forth in § 422.506(b)(3), 
§ 422.510(c)(1), § 423.507(b)(3), and 
§ 423.509(c)(1) related to notice and 
opportunity to develop and implement 
corrective actions could be improved to 
more effectively assist us and 
sponsoring organizations in achieving 
timely, efficient, and effective correction 
of identified underlying contract 
compliance deficiencies. These current 
compliance procedures require us to 
focus our internal oversight resources 
and expertise on reviewing and 
approving ‘‘how’’ sponsoring 
organizations will correct their 
deficiencies rather than utilizing our 
resources and expertise more effectively 
and efficiently to review information 
submitted by sponsoring organizations 
to determine if the underlying 
deficiencies have actually been 
corrected. For example, if the deficiency 
cited was for misclassification of 
appeals versus grievances, current 
practice requires a sponsoring 
organization to develop a written plan 
on how it will fix the misclassification 
problem. Then the sponsoring 
organization must submit the plan to us 
for review and approval before it would 
be allowed to implement the plan. 
Rather than focusing on the plan or 
process that the sponsoring organization 
developed, we instead, should focus on 
reviewing data to determine if the 
sponsoring organization has actually 
fixed the problem and is classifying 
appeals and grievances appropriately. 
Similarly, under the current 
compliance procedures, sponsoring 
organizations potentially expend 
significant resources and expertise 
responding to requests from us for plans 
about how they will correct deficiencies 
as opposed to expending efforts on 
correcting the deficiencies identified by 
us and providing sufficient evidence 
that the identified deficiencies have 
been corrected. Given that sponsoring 
organizations have varying business 
models, levels of resources, and 
expertise, it is particularly challenging 
for us to be the decision-maker as to 
whether one operational plan of 
correction under a particular 
operational business model versus 
another will most effectively correct 
identified deficiencies and achieve 
particular compliance outcomes. 
Therefore, we believe our compliance 
procedures need to shift from focusing 
on the submission of plans for our 
review and approval that merely outline 
a process for how deficiencies will be 
corrected to a focus on requiring plans 
to demonstrate that particular outcomes 
have been achieved, for example, that 
deficiencies have actually been 
corrected. We are proposing to eliminate 
the existing language contained in 
regulations at § 422.506(b)(3), 
§ 422.510(c)(1), § 423.507(b)(3), and 
§ 423.509(c)(1) that requires CAPs to be 
submitted for our approval prior to us 
issuing a notice of intent to terminate or 
nonrenew a contract. 
We are proposing instead to add new 
provisions at § 422.506(b)(3), 
§ 422.510(c)(1), § 423.507(b)(3), and 
§ 423.509(c)(1) that captures the 
outcome-oriented approach which is 
currently incorporated in our day-to-day 
ongoing contract compliance and 
oversight activities. Under this 
approach, we are proposing to add new 
provisions which state that before 
providing a notice of intent to terminate 
or nonrenew a contract, we will provide 
the sponsoring organization with a 
notice of its deficiencies and afford it 
the opportunity to develop and 
implement a CAP to correct these 
deficiencies. We are also proposing that 
the sponsoring organization is solely 
responsible for the identification, 
development, and implementation of its 
CAP and for demonstrating to us that 
the underlying deficiencies have been 
corrected within the time period 
afforded under the notice and 
opportunity for corrective action. 
All sponsoring organizations are 
assigned a CMS account manager whose 
primary responsibility consists of day- 
to-day monitoring and oversight of that 
organization. In addition to these 
account management monitoring and 
oversight activities, we conduct other 
oversight activities based on data and 
information collected from sponsoring 
organizations and from other relevant 
sources. As a part of these ongoing 
overall monitoring and oversight 
activities, sponsoring organizations 
routinely receive written notification of 
their compliance deficiencies, including 
but not limited to, notices of 
noncompliance, warning notices, and 
requests for corrective actions. These 
ongoing contract monitoring and 
oversight processes are designed to 
proactively prevent, detect, and respond 
to compliance deficiencies at the lowest 
level of occurrence by providing 
sponsoring organizations with ongoing 
notification and information from CMS

about the current status of any 
identified compliance deficiencies that 
come to our attention and an 
opportunity to correct where 
appropriate. As a result, in many 
instances sponsoring organizations will 
receive written notification of 
noncompliance and opportunities to 
correct any deficiencies arising from the 
above-described day-to-day monitoring 
and oversight procedures. Therefore, in 
most cases the sponsoring organization 
will have been made fully aware of its 
deficiencies before CMS provides it 
with the notice and opportunity to 
implement a CAP that must be afforded 
prior to CMS issuing a notice of intent 
to terminate or nonrenew a contract 
under sections 1857(h) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 
In addition to these proposals, we are 
proposing to amend the existing 
language at § 422.506(b)(3), 
§ 422.510(c)(1), § 423.507(b)(3), and 
§ 423.509(c)(1) that sets forth the 
specific timeframes afforded sponsoring 
organizations for the development and 
implementation of a CAP prior to CMS 
issuing a notice of intent to terminate or 
nonrenew. 
Based on our experience under our 
ongoing contract compliance and 
oversight processes and our new 
outcome-oriented approaches to 
contract oversight and compliance, we 
have concluded that affording 
sponsoring organizations at least 30 
calendar days to develop and 
implement a CAP prior to issuing the 
notice of intent to terminate or 
nonrenew is a sufficiently reasonable 
opportunity under the statutory 
authority afforded. We will consider the 
nature and extent of the particular 
compliance deficiencies and other 
relevant factors such as whether or not 
the deficiencies are isolated or repeated 
and longstanding, and whether or not 
the entity has been afforded a prior 
notice and opportunity to correct in 
reaching a decision whether it may be 
appropriate for the MAO or Part D 
Sponsor to be afforded more than 30 
days to correct the identified 
deficiencies. 
Thus, we are proposing to amend 
§ 422.506(b)(3), § 422.510(c)(1), 
§ 423.507(b)(3), and § 423.509(c)(1) to 
afford sponsoring organizations at least 
30 calendar days to fully implement a 
CAP and to demonstrate to CMS that the 
underlying deficiencies have been 
corrected. 
9. Procedures for Imposing Intermediate 
Sanctions and Civil Money Penalties 
Under Parts C and D (§ 422.756 and 
§ 423.756)) 
Sections 1857(g) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(E) of the Act provide the 
Secretary the ability to impose 
intermediate sanctions on sponsoring 
organizations. Intermediate sanctions 
under these statutory provisions consist 
of suspension of enrollment, suspension 
of payment and CMPs. Sections 
1857(g)(2)(B) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(E) of 
the Act that specifically govern 
enrollment suspensions require the 
intermediate sanctions to remain in 
place until the Secretary is satisfied that 
the basis for the sanction determination 
has been corrected and is not likely to 
recur. Additionally, under sections 
1857(e)(1) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the 
Act, sponsoring organizations are 
required to provide the Secretary with 
such information as the Secretary may 
find necessary and appropriate. Current 
regulations governing intermediate 
sanctions are contained in Subpart O of 
parts 422 and 423. Sections 422.756 and 
423.756 provide specific procedures for 
imposing intermediate sanctions and 
CMPs, and include provisions outlining 
the duration of the sanction. 
Existing regulations at § 422.756(d)(3) 
and § 423.756(d)(3) incorporate the 
statutory standard by providing that the 
sanction remains in effect until we 
notify the sponsoring organization that 
we are satisfied that the basis for 
imposing the sanction has been 
corrected and is not likely to recur. 
Based on recent experience, it has been 
difficult at times for us to make the 
determination to lift a sanction. For 
example, when we impose an 
enrollment sanction on a sponsoring 
organization because it has failed to 
comply with enrollment and 
disenrollment requirements, it is very 
difficult for us to conclude that the 
sponsoring organization’s enrollment 
deficiencies have been corrected and are 
not likely to recur when the 
organization is not permitted to enroll 
members. Difficulties also arise when 
the sponsoring organization attempts to 
fix deficiencies with highly technical 
internal business processes. In order to 
assist us in making the determination 
that the deficiencies have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur, we 
need to have greater flexibilities at our 
disposal. 
We are proposing two changes to the 
regulation that provide additional 
flexibilities to assist us in making the 
determination to lift a sanction. First, 
we are proposing that we may require 
the sponsoring organization to hire an 
independent auditor to provide us with 
additional information to determine if 
the deficiencies upon which the 
sanction was based have actually been 
corrected and are not likely to recur. 
The independent auditor would be 
hired by the sponsoring organization 
and work in accordance with our 
specifications in order to provide 
accurate and reliable information to 
CMS. 
In making a determination to lift 
sanctions, we often must rely on either 
self-disclosed information from the 
sanctioned sponsoring organization, 
CMS data, some of which is also self- 
disclosed, or we must attempt to engage 
in a process to independently verify that 
the underlying deficiencies have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur. 
Given our experience with the nature 
and extent of some compliance 
deficiencies (for example, those caused 
by information technology system 
deficiencies or lack of adequate internal 
controls) and the need to obtain the 
level of skill and experience necessary 
to conduct an exhaustive audit and 
verification of the correction of these 
deficiencies, we have concluded that an 
independent auditor hired by the 
sponsoring organization would be 
beneficial for both the sponsoring 
organization and CMS. This proposal is 
consistent with our statutory authority 
which requires sponsoring organizations 
to provide information to us when we 
deem it is necessary and appropriate. 
An independent auditor, who is familiar 
with the processes of the sanctioned 
sponsoring organization, may be able to 
provide CMS with important 
information that we may use to help us 
make a more timely decision as to when 
to lift a sanction. 
A similar approach is used by the 
HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
in their Corporate Integrity Agreements 
and/or Self-Disclosure Protocol 
processes. The OIG often negotiates 
compliance obligations with health care 
providers and other entities as part of 
the settlement of Federal health care 
program investigations. A provider or 
entity consents to these obligations as 
part of the civil settlement and in 
exchange for the OIG’s agreement not to 
seek an exclusion of that health care 
provider or entity from participation in 
Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal 
health care programs. The typical terms 
of a comprehensive OIG corporate 
integrity agreement include the 
requirement for the provider to retain an 
independent review organization to 
provide independent validation and 
verification of adherence to Medicare 
requirements in relevant areas where

the provider has been found to be 
noncompliant. 
We do not intend to require all 
sponsoring organizations that are under 
intermediate sanctions to hire an 
independent auditor because not all 
determinations will require the 
expertise of an independent auditor. 
However, there are situations when the 
expertise of an independent auditor will 
be helpful and in those cases, we are 
proposing we be afforded the discretion 
to require that an auditor be hired by the 
sponsoring organization. For example, 
an independent auditor who specializes 
in complex information technology 
systems and who has knowledge of how 
the systems interact with each other to 
be compliant with our requirements 
may be helpful in those instances where 
an organization with enrollment and 
disenrollment processing systems has 
been sanctioned. This is an example of 
a situation where we would require the 
sponsoring organization to hire an 
independent auditor in order to assist in 
making the determination that the 
deficiencies that formed the basis of the 
sanction have been corrected and are 
not likely to recur. 
We are also considering an alternative 
proposal whereby instead of providing 
us with the authority to require 
sponsoring organizations to engage an 
independent auditor, we would grant 
sponsoring organizations the discretion 
to hire an independent auditor to 
evaluate the organization’s compliance 
with our requirements. We would afford 
the results of the independent auditor’s 
review some weight in our 
determination of whether the bases for 
the sanction have been corrected and 
are not likely to recur. We invite 
comments from sponsors and the 
industry about this alternative proposal 
and suggestions on other options we 
could implement to accomplish the 
desired outcome. 
At this time we are proposing to add 
language to § 422.756 and § 423.756 that 
would allow us to require that a 
sponsoring organization hire an 
independent auditor to provide us with 
additional information to determine if 
the deficiencies that are the basis for a 
sanction have been corrected and are 
not likely to recur. Under either this 
proposal or our alternative proposal, the 
independent auditor would work in 
accordance with our specifications and 
must be willing to attest that a complete 
and full independent review has been 
performed. 
Next, we are proposing that in 
instances where an enrollment and/or 
marketing suspension has been 
imposed, we may determine that it is 
appropriate to subject the sponsoring 
organization to a ‘‘test period’’ whereby 
the organization or sponsor will, for a 
limited time, engage in marketing 
activities and/or accept enrollments in 
order to assist us in making a 
determination as to whether the bases 
for the sanctions have been corrected 
and are not likely to recur. The basis for 
this proposal is that we have found that 
there is often not a satisfactory way to 
determine if marketing and/or 
enrollment problems have been 
corrected while a sanction is in place 
and no such activities are permitted. 
Similarly, sponsoring organizations also 
have experienced challenges in 
demonstrating to us that these kinds of 
deficiencies have been corrected and are 
not likely to recur while they are under 
marketing and/or enrollment sanctions. 
In order to lift intermediate sanctions as 
expeditiously as possible when the 
sponsoring organization has corrected 
the deficiencies and to protect 
beneficiaries if the deficiencies have not 
been fully corrected, this proposed 
provision will permit us to assess 
whether the deficiencies upon which 
the sanction was made have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur by 
conducting a test of the organizations or 
sponsor’s processes. The specific 
requirements for the marketing and/or 
enrollment ‘‘test period’’ will be 
determined by considering numerous 
factors, including but not limited to: the 
size of the organization, the specific 
deficiencies, and the timeframe in 
which the ‘‘test period’’ is conducted. 
This provision will benefit sponsoring 
organizations, beneficiaries, and CMS. 
Sponsoring organizations will have an 
effective way to demonstrate that a 
sanction should be lifted. Beneficiaries 
will be protected because we will have 
sufficient evidence that deficiencies 
have been corrected prior to lifting 
sanctions and we will be assured that 
the bases for the sanctions have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur. 
Therefore, we are proposing to add 
language to § 422.756 and § 423.756 that 
in instances where marketing or 
enrollment or both intermediate 
sanctions have been imposed, we may 
determine, in our sole discretion, that it 
is appropriate to require the sponsoring 
organization to market and/or to accept 
enrollments for a limited time in order 
to assist us in making a determination 
as to whether the deficiencies that are 
the bases for the intermediate sanctions 
have been corrected and are not likely 
to recur. Following this time period, if 
we determine the deficiencies have not 
been corrected or are likely to recur, the 
intermediate sanction will remain in 
effect until such time that we are 
assured the deficiencies have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur. 
The sponsoring organization would 
have not had a right to a hearing to 
challenge our determination to keep the 
sanction in effect. 
In addition to the above proposed 
changes to § 422.756 and § 423.756, we 
are proposing to delete the existing 
provisions at § 422.756(c) and 
§ 423.756(c) which currently detail the 
three types of intermediate sanctions 
that may be imposed pursuant to our 
authority under sections 1857(g)(2)(B) 
through (C) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(E) of 
the Act. These provisions are 
duplicative of the list of sanctions at 
§ 422.750(a) and § 423.750(a) and are 
unnecessary. Due to this deletion, we 
are proposing to redesignate paragraphs 
(d) through (f) in § 422.756 and 
§ 423.756 as paragraphs (c) through (e), 
respectively. 
10. Termination of Contracts Under 
Parts C and D (§ 422.510(a) and 
§ 423.509(a)) 
Sections 1857(c)(2) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(B) of the Act permit CMS to 
terminate a sponsoring organization’s 
contract if the sponsoring 
organization— 
• Has failed substantially to carry out 
the contract; 
• Is carrying out the contract in a 
manner inconsistent with the efficient 
and effective administration of this part; 
or 
• No longer substantially meets the 
applicable conditions of this part. 
Existing regulations at § 422.510(a)(6) 
through (12) and § 423.509(a)(6) through 
(11) provide a number of bases (in 
addition to the statutory bases) upon 
which a contract may be terminated. 
This list does not include every reason 
for which we have the authority to 
terminate a contract. For example, the 
list does not explicitly include a 
provision that provides that a failure by 
the sponsoring organization to comply 
with enrollment and disenrollment 
regulations may be a basis for CMS 
termination. However, sponsoring 
organizations must follow enrollment 
and disenrollment regulations and a 
failure to comply with these regulations 
may be a basis for terminating the 
sponsoring organization’s contract 
because it would have failed 
substantially to carry out the terms of its 
contract as required by the Act. We are 
concerned that by not specifically 
including each and every requirement 
on this enumerated list, organizations 
may be under the mistaken impression 
that we cannot take an action to 
terminate (or non-renew) a contract, or 
sanction an organization, for a failure to 
comply with a requirement(s) that is not

54649 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
enumerated. Therefore, we are 
proposing to delete the enumerated 
bases for termination contained at 
§ 422.510(a)(6) through (12) and 
§ 423.509(a)(6) through (11). In addition, 
we are proposing to revise § 422.510(a) 
and § 423.509(a) to separate the 
language into two paragraphs. The first 
paragraph, (a)(1), will list the statutory 
bases for termination under sections 
1857(c)(2) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(B) of the 
Act which state that we may at any time 
terminate a contract if we determine 
that the sponsoring organization has: (i) 
Failed substantially to carry out the 
contract; (ii) is carrying out the contract 
in a manner inconsistent with the 
efficient and effective administration of 
this part; or (iii) no longer substantially 
meets the applicable conditions of this 
part. The second paragraph, (a)(2), will 
clarify—(i) that a sponsoring 
organization’s failure to comply with 
our regulations, (ii) failure to meet 
performance standards; and/or (iii) 
participation in false, fraudulent, or 
abusive activities, may constitute a basis 
for CMS to determine that the 
sponsoring organization meets the 
requirements for contract termination in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1). 
More specifically, we are proposing to 
add new language to § 422.510(a)(2)(i) 
and § 423.509(a)(2)(i) that failure to 
comply with any of the regulatory 
requirements contained in Parts 422 or 
423 may constitute a basis for CMS to 
determine that the sponsoring 
organization meets the requirements for 
contract termination in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1). This new provision is 
intended to clarify that compliance with 
all regulations is necessary to remain a 
contracting organization with CMS and 
if the sponsoring organization’s failure 
to comply with the regulations supports 
one or more of the bases for termination 
in paragraph (a)(1), then we may 
terminate the contract. 
We are also proposing to add new 
language to § 422.510(a)(2)(ii) and 
§ 423.509(a)(2)(ii) that failure to meet 
our performance expectations in 
carrying out the Part C and Part D 
regulatory requirements may constitute 
a basis for us to determine that the 
sponsoring organization meets the 
requirements for contract termination in 
accordance with proposed paragraph 
(a)(1). This includes when we determine 
that a sponsoring organization is out of 
compliance with a Medicare 
requirement because our analysis of 
data related to that sponsoring 
organization’s performance indicates it 
is an outlier relative to that of other 
organizations. 
In some instances, we may use an 
outlier analysis to determine a sponsor’s 
performance relative to industry 
standards that were established by 
looking at the performance of all 
sponsors across the program, as 
described earlier in the preamble in our 
discussion of the development of our 
policies concerning the awarding, 
monitoring, and enforcement of 
Medicare contracts. This strategy is part 
of a larger strategy to oversee the 
program using a data driven, risk-based, 
transparent approach. This information 
is used to monitor plan sponsor 
compliance and make plan-specific and 
programmatic decisions. As reflected in 
the proposed regulations, in addition to 
using these data for program-wide 
evaluations and assessments, these 
performance standards will continue to 
be used to make assessments concerning 
compliance with our requirements and, 
when deemed appropriate, to take CMS 
contract actions, including contract 
termination and nonrenewal. 
Finally, in our proposed language we 
are retaining the authority to terminate 
a sponsoring organization that has 
committed or participated in false, 
fraudulent, or abusive activities as 
currently stated in § 422.510(a)(4) and 
§ 423.509(a)(4). However, we are 
proposing to redesignate current 
§ 422.510(a)(4) and § 423.509(a)(4) as 
§ 422.510(a)(2)(iii) and 
§ 423.509(a)(2)(iii), respectively, as such 
failures may also constitute a basis for 
us to determine that the sponsoring 
organization meets the requirements for 
contract termination in accordance with 
the proposed revisions to paragraph 
(a)(1). 
In addition, we are proposing 
additional amended language to this 
regulation. The existing regulations 
permit us to terminate a contract only 
when we determine that a sponsoring 
organization’s fraudulent activities 
concern the Medicare program. We 
believe that we should not be 
contracting with MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors who commit or 
participate in fraudulent activities 
related to any governmental health care 
programs. Therefore, we are proposing 
to amend this regulation to include 
false, fraudulent, or abusive activities 
affecting Medicaid, or other State or 
Federal health care programs. 
In addition, existing regulations that 
govern termination at § 422.510(a)(5) 
and § 423.509(a)(5) provide that we may 
terminate a contract if the sponsoring 
organization experiences financial 
difficulties so severe that its ability to 
make necessary health services available 
is impaired to the point of posing an 
imminent and serious risk to the health 
of its enrollees, or otherwise fails to 
make services available to the extent 
that such a risk to health exists. This 
language incorporates the Secretary’s 
authority under sections 1857(h)(2) and 
1860D–12(b)(3)(F) of the Act to take an 
immediate termination if it is 
determined that a delay in termination, 
in order to comply with the CAP and 
appeal termination procedures, would 
pose an imminent and serious risk to 
the health of the individuals enrolled. 
We are proposing changes elsewhere in 
these regulations to our provisions 
governing expedited terminations. 
Therefore, we are proposing to delete 
the regulatory text contained at 
§ 422.510(a)(5) and § 423.509(a)(5). 
Recognizing that it is not possible to 
enumerate every reason for which we 
have the authority to terminate a 
contract, we believe we have reached a 
good balance between providing 
sufficient regulatory detail and 
preserving administrative flexibility. 
When regulatory provisions require 
further clarification, we plan to further 
define through subregulatory guidance 
how we would operationalize these 
provisions. We have historically used 
our manual chapters, reporting 
requirements, and marketing guidelines 
to indicate how we measure compliance 
with our performance requirements and 
what we consider acceptable practice. 
We solicit comment on whether these 
regulatory provisions provide sufficient 
clarity. If not, we solicit comment on 
whether clarification should be 
provided through regulation or 
subregulatory guidance, such as the 
annual Call Letter or our Manual. 
11. Request for Hearing Under Parts C 
and D (§ 422.662 and § 423.651) 
Sections 1857(c) and 1860D–12 of the 
Act permit us to terminate contracts 
with sponsoring organizations. Current 
regulations at § 422.662(a) and 
§ 423.651(a) governing the hearing 
procedures require sponsoring 
organizations to file a request for a 
hearing on contract determinations with 
the Hearing Officer and to also file it 
with ‘‘any CMS office.’’ This procedure 
is ineffective and inefficient because it 
is likely to result in a request for hearing 
not being received by the appropriate 
officials within CMS. Consequently, we 
are proposing a modification in the 
language contained at § 422.662(a) and 
§ 423.651(a) to state that the sponsoring 
organization must file the request for a 
hearing in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the notice of 
the contract determination or 
intermediate sanction, thus ensuring 
that the proper officials within CMS 
receive the request and can act upon the 
request in a timely manner.

54650 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
We are also making a conforming 
change at § 422.662(b) and § 423.651(b) 
which govern the timeframes for filing 
the request for hearing to provide that 
the request must be filed within 15 
calendar days after receipt of the notice 
(versus the existing language which 
states 15 calendar days from the ‘‘date 
CMS notifies’’ the sponsoring 
organization of its determination). This 
change is to ensure consistency with the 
way deadlines are described in other 
regulatory provisions of parts 422 and 
423 governing contract determinations 
or the imposition of intermediate 
sanctions (including related appeals 
processes). 
12. Burden of Proof, Standard of Proof, 
Standards of Review, and Conduct of 
Hearing (§ 422.660, § 423.650, § 422.676 
and § 423.658) 
Under the existing regulations at 
§ 422.660(b), and § 423.650(b), when 
appealing a contract determination or an 
intermediate sanction, the sponsoring 
organization bears the burden of proof 
to demonstrate that it was in 
‘‘substantial compliance’’ with our 
requirements on the ‘‘earliest of’’ 
following three dates: 
• The date of the notice of contract 
determination or intermediate sanction. 
• The date of the most recent onsite 
audit. 
• The date of the alleged breach of the 
current contract or past substantial 
noncompliance as determined by CMS. 
In practice, these existing standards of 
review (‘‘substantial compliance’’ and 
‘‘earliest of test’’) have led to confusion 
among parties to the hearing and have 
been difficult for the Hearing Officer to 
apply. We have come to realize that the 
existing ‘‘substantial compliance’’ 
standard of review articulated at 
§ 422.660(b), and § 423.650(b) does not 
reflect the nuances of the different legal 
standards provided in the Act for 
making contract determinations and 
imposing intermediate sanctions. For 
example, sections 1857(c)(2)(B) and 
1860D–12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide 
that the Secretary may terminate a 
contract if the Secretary finds that the 
sponsoring organization ‘‘has failed 
substantially to carry out the contract, is 
carrying out the contract in a manner 
inconsistent with the efficient and 
effective administration of this part, or 
no longer substantially meets the 
applicable conditions of this part.’’ 
Similarly, there is no reference to a 
substantial compliance standard in the 
bases available to CMS for imposing 
intermediate sanctions. Based on these 
nuances, we have determined that the 
application of the substantial 
compliance standard of review to all 
appeals is unnecessarily confusing and 
may have led to unintended 
consequences in that it may have 
distorted review of the applicable 
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to delete 
‘‘substantial compliance’’ as a standard 
of review. 
In addition to the preceding, the 
‘‘earliest of’’ test does not accurately 
reflect how and when we make our 
determinations for different contract 
actions or intermediate sanctions. For 
example, when making a determination 
as to whether or not we should enter 
into a contract with an applicant, we 
review all of the information that the 
applicant provides and decides whether 
it meets our standards according to 
§ 422.501 and § 422.502 or § 423.502 
and § 423.503. If the applicant does not 
meet those standards, then we will deny 
the application. During a hearing, it 
would be inappropriate for the 
applicant to insist that its application 
should be approved because it corrected 
its deficiencies after we issued a denial 
of the application. The ‘‘earliest of’’ test 
may create this mistaken impression 
because it provides that during a 
hearing the applicant must demonstrate 
that it was in ‘‘substantial compliance’’ 
with our requirements on the ‘‘earliest 
of’’ one of three dates. This creates 
confusion and imposes an unworkable 
time period for the applicant or 
sponsoring organization to demonstrate 
that it has met CMS standards. 
Therefore, we are also proposing to 
delete the existing regulations which 
provide for an ‘‘earliest of’’ test. 
Finally, though the existing 
regulations explicitly state that the 
sponsoring organization bears the 
burden of proof, it does not provide the 
standard of proof that is to be applied 
by the hearing officer. We believe that 
the sponsoring organization bearing the 
burden of proof is appropriate since the 
purpose of the hearing is to provide the 
sponsoring organization an opportunity 
to appeal and dispute our contract 
determination or imposition of 
intermediate sanction. Therefore, we 
believe that no change is necessary 
concerning the burden of proof. In 
order, however, to more clearly 
articulate the standard of proof and 
standards of review we are proposing 
the following changes to our 
regulations. 
First, we are clarifying the standard of 
proof that we believe applies to these 
appeals proceedings. It has been our 
experience that the hearing officer does 
appropriately use the preponderance of 
evidence standard when weighing the 
evidence at a hearing for an appeal of a 
CMS contract determination or 
imposition of intermediate sanction. We 
believe, however, that it is important to 
explicitly state the standard of proof so 
as to provide as much clarity and 
consistency as possible for the Hearing 
Officers and the parties to a hearing. In 
addition, the preponderance of the 
evidence standard is consistent with the 
standard of proof used in Subparts T to 
Parts 422 and 423 which governs appeal 
proceedings for civil money penalties. 
Second, we are addressing the use of 
a proper standard of review. The 
proposed standard of review that we 
believe applies to these appeal 
procedures is dependent on the type of 
contract determination or intermediate 
sanction. Our proposed revisions make 
explicit which standard of review is to 
be applied by the Hearing Officer to the 
three types of contract determinations 
identified at § 422.641(a) and 
§ 423.641(a) and to intermediate 
sanctions identified at § 422.750 and 
§ 423.750 by noting the different 
requirements for each type of action. 
Specifically, the proposed regulation 
clarifies that the standards of review are 
different for determinations involving 
Part C or D contract application 
qualifications, those involving the 
termination or non-renewal of a 
sponsoring organization’s contract, and 
those involving the imposition of 
intermediate sanctions. These separate 
and distinct standards of review are 
intended to reflect the inherent 
differences in the processes and 
standards we use to make each type of 
determination. 
Therefore, we are proposing to delete 
the existing language contained at 
§ 422.660(b) and § 423.650(b) and 
replace it with language which provides 
that the applicant or the sponsoring 
organization has the burden of proving 
by a preponderance of the evidence that 
our determination was inconsistent with 
the requirements of the applicable part. 
We specify that these requirements are 
§ 422.501 and § 422.502 that governs the 
processes and standards for applicants 
for the MA program, § 423.502 and 
§ 423.503 for applicants for the Part D 
program, § 422.506 or § 422.510 for MA 
contract determinations, § 423.507 or 
§ 423.509 for Part D contract 
determinations, and § 422.752 or 
§ 423.752 for intermediate sanctions. 
Additionally, we propose to modify 
§ 422.660(c) and § 423.660(c), which 
currently specify that the notice of any 
decision favorable to a Part C or D 
applicants appealing a determination 
that it is not qualified to enter into a 
contract with us must be issued by July 
15th for the contract in question to be 
effective on January 1st of the following 
year. We propose changing the July 15th

deadline to September 1st. Over the past 
4 years, we have found the July 15th 
deadline to be an unreasonable 
timeframe within which to complete the 
hearing process afforded denied 
applicants pursuant to Subpart N of 
Parts 422 and 423. September 1st allows 
sufficient time for an applicant to 
receive a decision issued by the CMS 
Hearing Officer on the status of its 
application and for us to contract with 
the applicant should the applicant 
receive a favorable decision. 
Accordingly, we are also proposing to 
make the following conforming changes 
to § 422.660 and § 423.650. 
• Revise the section headings for 
§ 422.660 and § 423.650 to read ‘‘Right 
to a hearing, burden of proof, standard 
of proof, and standards of review’’ in 
order to conform with the section 
headings to our proposed changes. 
• Add paragraph headings. We 
believe that these additions would 
improve the structure and readability of 
the proposed regulatory text. 
• Correct the references in 
§ 422.660(a)(1) and § 423.650(a)(1). 
Sections 422.660(a)(1) and 423.650(a)(1) 
currently state that a contract applicant 
that has been determined to be 
unqualified to enter into a contract with 
CMS under § 422.501 and § 423.503 
respectively, is entitled to a hearing. 
The correct citations for the sections 
that we use when making a 
determination as to whether to enter 
into a contract with an applicant are 
§ 422.501 and § 422.502 for Part C 
contracts and § 423.502 and § 423.503 
for Part D contracts. Therefore, we are 
proposing to accurately reflect these 
references in the regulations by making 
a technical change which incorporates 
the appropriate and necessary citations 
by adding the reference § 422.502 to 
§ 422.660(a)(1), and by adding the 
reference § 423.502 to § 423.650(a)(1). 
• Make technical changes in 
§ 422.660(a) and § 423.650(a). In 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of these 
sections, we are proposing to revise the 
terminology preceding the cross- 
reference (that is, change ‘‘pursuant to’’ 
to ‘‘in accordance with’’ or ‘‘under’’), 
adding a section symbol before the 
section number, and completing the 
cross-reference by adding the phrase ‘‘of 
this part’’ after the section number. 
Finally, we are also proposing to 
modify the existing regulations at 
§ 422.676(d) and § 423.658(d) governing 
the conduct of the hearing. We are 
proposing to revise the language 
contained in § 422.676(d) and 
§ 423.658(d) to provide that, consistent 
with the burden of proof, during the 
hearing the sponsoring organization 
bears the burden of being the first to 
present its argument to the Hearing 
Officer according to any briefing 
schedule determined by the Hearing 
Officer. We believe that requiring the 
sponsoring organization to present its 
argument to the Hearing Officer first is 
appropriate since the basis for our 
determination is detailed in the notice 
of determination that is sent to the 
sponsoring organization. Since the 
purpose of the sponsoring organization’s 
appeal is to dispute our determination 
it seems appropriate that the sponsoring 
organization should first be required to 
present its argument as to why it 
believes the determination is incorrect 
or otherwise not supported prior to 
CMS’ putting on its case in support of 
its contract or intermediate sanction 
determination. 
13. Expedited Contract Terminations 
Procedures (§ 422.510, § 423.509, 
§ 422.664, § 423.652, § 422.644, and 
§ 423.642)) Under Parts C and D 
Sections 1857(h)(2) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide the 
procedures requiring reasonable notice 
and opportunity to develop and 
implement a CAP and for a hearing shall 
not apply prior to termination if the 
Secretary determines that a delay in 
termination, resulting from compliance 
with these procedures would pose an 
imminent and serious risk to the health 
of individuals enrolled with the 
sponsoring organization. These kinds of 
terminations are referred to as 
‘‘expedited terminations’’ under current 
regulations. 
Sections 422.510(a)(4) and (5), and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) and (5) currently provide 
two of these bases for expedited 
terminations. Under § 422.510(a)(4) and 
§ 423.509(a)(4), we may terminate a 
contract when there is credible evidence 
that the sponsoring organization 
committed or participated in false, 
fraudulent, or abusive activities 
affecting the Medicare program. Under 
§ 422.510(a)(5) and § 423.509(a)(5), we 
may terminate a contract when the 
sponsoring organization experiences 
financial difficulties so severe that its 
ability to make necessary health services 
available is impaired ‘‘to the point of 
posing an imminent and serious risk to 
the health of its enrollees or otherwise 
fails to make services available to the 
extent that such a risk to health exists’’, 
thereby incorporating the expedited 
termination statutory language. 
Termination procedures at 
§ 422.510(c)(2) and § 423.509(c)(2) 
provide that if a contract is terminated 
under § 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5), and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5), the sponsoring 
organization will not have the 
opportunity to submit a CAP prior to 
termination. Our notice of termination 
procedures also provide at 
§ 422.510(b)(2)(i) and § 423.509(b)(2)(i) 
that, if a contract is terminated under 
§ 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5) and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5), we will notify 
the sponsoring organization that its 
contract will be terminated on a date 
specified by CMS. Appeal procedures at 
§ 422.664(b)(2) and § 423.652(b)(2) 
currently provide that a contract 
terminated under either of these bases 
will be terminated on the date specified 
by CMS and will not be postponed if a 
hearing is requested. 
These current regulations governing 
expedited terminations do not 
adequately reflect the scope of the 
Secretary’s authority under section 
1857(h)(2) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(F) of the 
Act. The Act does not limit the 
Secretary’s authority to effectuate 
expedited terminations solely based on 
the circumstances prescribed in 
§ 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5), and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5) and therefore, 
these regulations are unduly limiting. If 
compliance with the CAP provisions 
and hearing procedures prior to 
termination would pose an imminent 
and serious risk to the health of 
individuals enrolled with the 
sponsoring organization, the Act 
permits us to terminate a contract 
without providing a right to a CAP or 
hearing prior to termination. While the 
current regulations provide several 
instances where such a determination 
would be appropriate, these are not the 
only instances where such a 
determination would need to be made to 
protect beneficiaries from imminent and 
serious risk to their health. 
Therefore, we are proposing to delete 
the references to § 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5) 
and § 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5) as contained 
in the termination (§ 422.510(b)(2)(i), 
§ 423.509(b)(2)(i), § 422.510(c)(2) and 
§ 423.509(c)(2)) and in the appeal 
procedures (§ 422.664(b)(2) and 
§ 423.652(b)(2)). More specifically, we 
are proposing to amend the termination 
procedures language of § 422.510(b)(2)(i) 
and § 423.509(b)(2)(i) to clarify that for 
terminations based on violations 
prescribed in § 422.510(a) and 
§ 423.509(a), if we determine that a 
delay in termination, resulting from 
compliance with CAP and hearing 
procedures prior to termination, would 
pose an imminent and serious risk to 
the health of the individuals enrolled 
with the sponsoring organization, the 
effective date of the termination will be 
specified, in writing by CMS. In 
addition, we are proposing to amend the 
termination procedures language at 
§ 422.510(c)(2) and § 423.509(c)(2) to 
clarify that if we determine that a delay

in termination, resulting from 
compliance with the CAP procedures, 
would pose an imminent and serious 
risk to the health of the individuals 
enrolled with the MA organization or 
Part D sponsor, the MA organization or 
Part D sponsor will not be provided 
with an opportunity to develop and 
implement a CAP prior to termination. 
Lastly, we are proposing to amend the 
appeals procedures language at 
§ 422.664(b)(2) and § 423.652(b)(2) to 
state that if we determine that a delay 
in termination, resulting from 
compliance with the notice and 
opportunity for hearing procedures, 
prior to termination, would pose an 
imminent and serious risk to the health 
of individuals enrolled with the MA 
organization or Part D sponsor, the date 
of termination will not be postponed if 
the MA organization or Part D sponsor 
requests a hearing. 
It is important to note that our 
proposal to delete the references to 
§ 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5), and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5) contained in the 
existing termination and appeal 
procedures should not be interpreted in 
any way to limit our ability under our 
statutory authority to expedite a 
termination when we determine that a 
sponsoring organization is experiencing 
severe financial difficulty, otherwise 
fails to make services available to the 
extent that such a risk to the health 
exists or when there is credible 
evidence that a sponsoring organization 
committed or participated in false, 
fraudulent, or abusive activities. 
We are also making conforming 
changes (to ensure consistency of the 
proposed regulations) to the termination 
notice procedures contained in 
§ 422.510(b) and § 423.509(b) and notice 
of contract determinations contained in 
§ 422.644(c) and § 423.642(c) which 
reference the expedited termination 
bases. In § 422.510(b) and § 423.509(b), 
we are deleting the references to 
§ 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5), and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5). In § 422.644(c) 
and § 423.642(c), we are deleting the 
references to § 422.510(a)(4) or (a)(5), 
and § 423.509(a)(4) or (a)(5) and 
replacing the language with the 
proposed language contained in 
§ 422.510(b)(2)(i) and § 423.509(b)(2)(i). 
14. Time and Place of Hearing Under 
Parts C and D (§ 422.670 and § 423.655) 
Sections 1857(h)(1)(b) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide the 
procedures requiring reasonable notice 
and opportunity for hearing when we 
terminate a sponsoring organization’s 
contract. Current regulations at 
§ 422.670(b) and § 423.655(b) provide 
the Hearing Officer may, on his or her 
own motion, or at the request of party, 
change the time and place for the 
hearing and may adjourn or postpone 
the hearing. Based on our experience 
with this process, we believe that both 
sponsoring organizations and we may 
need additional time to prepare for a 
hearing. Therefore, we are proposing to 
add language to § 422.670(b) and 
§ 423.655(b) to state the sponsoring 
organization or we may request that the 
hearing date be postponed by filing a 
written request no later than 5 calendar 
days prior to the scheduled hearing, 
when either the sponsoring organization 
or CMS requests an extension, the 
Hearing Officer will provide a one-time 
15 calendar day postponement, and 
additional postponements may be 
granted at the discretion of the Hearing 
Officer. 
In addition, current regulations at 
§ 422.670(a) and § 423.655(a) require 
that the CMS Hearing Officer schedule 
a hearing to review a contract 
determination or the imposition of an 
intermediate sanction within 30 
calendar days from the ‘‘receipt of 
request for the hearing.’’ We are 
proposing to change the language at 
§ 422.670(a) and § 423.655(a) to provide 
that the CMS Hearing Officer schedule 
a hearing to review a contract 
determination or the imposition of an 
intermediate sanction within 30 
calendar days after the ‘‘receipt of the 
request for the hearing.’’ This change is 
to ensure consistency with the way 
deadlines are described in other 
regulatory provisions of parts 422 and 
423 governing contract determinations 
or the imposition of intermediate 
sanctions (including related appeals 
processes). 
15. Discovery Under Parts C and D 
(§ 422.682 and § 423.661) 
Sections 1857(h)(1)(b) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide the 
procedures requiring reasonable notice 
and opportunity for hearing when we 
terminate a sponsoring organization’s 
contract. The statute does not require a 
formal discovery process for CMS 
appeal procedures. In the December 5, 
2007 final rule, we provided in 
§ 422.682 and § 423.661 for a formal 
discovery process prior to hearing. 
However, based on our experience since 
the promulgation of this rule, we do not 
now believe a formal discovery process 
is necessary or appropriate for these 
kinds of proceedings. In addition, the 
existing timeframe in which the hearing 
normally must take place, 30 calendar 
days after request for a hearing, does not 
easily accommodate a formal discovery 
process. 
Therefore, we are proposing to delete 
the formal discovery process contained 
in § 422.682 and § 423.661. 
Simultaneously, we need to ensure that 
both parties receive witness lists and 
relevant documents with enough time 
prior to the hearing while at the same 
time ensuring the hearing is conducted 
in a timely and orderly fashion. 
Therefore, we are proposing to amend 
the regulations at § 422.682 and 
§ 423.661. First, we propose to modify 
the existing regulations to change the 
titles of § 422.682 and § 423.661 from 
‘‘Discovery’’ to ‘‘Witnesses and 
Documents’’ to reflect the changes 
made. Second, under this newly titled 
section, we are proposing to substitute 
new language which requires that 
witness lists and documents must be 
identified and exchanged at least 5 
calendar days prior to the scheduled 
hearing. We believe this change more 
appropriately reflects what is necessary 
to meet the evidentiary needs of the 
parties by providing the parties with the 
appropriate amount of information in 
advance of the hearing to present their 
evidence and counter arguments. 
Additionally, existing regulations at 
§ 422.670(a)(2) and § 423.655(a)(2) 
currently provide that the Hearing 
Officer will notify the parties of the 
ability to conduct formal discovery. 
Because we are proposing to delete the 
formal discovery processes in § 422.682 
and § 423.661, we are proposing to make 
a conforming change by deleting 
§ 422.670(a)(2) and § 423.655(a)(2). 
16. Review by the Administrator Under 
Parts C and D (§ 422.692(a) and 
§ 423.666(a)) 
Sections 1857(h)(1)(b) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide the 
procedures requiring reasonable notice 
and opportunity for hearing when we 
terminate a sponsoring organization’s 
contract. Our current regulations at 
§ 422.692 and § 423.666 provide for a 
sponsoring organization to request 
review by the CMS Administrator of a 
hearing decision. These existing 
regulations provide that a sponsoring 
organization may request review by the 
Administrator within 15 calendar days 
of ‘‘receiving the hearing decision.’’ 
We are proposing to revise the 
language at § 422.692(a) and 
§ 423.666(a) to provide that the 
sponsoring organization may request 
review by the Administrator within 15 
calendar days after ‘‘receipt of the 
hearing decision.’’ In addition, we are 
proposing to change the language at 
§ 422.692(c) and § 423.666(c) governing 
the notification of Administrator 
determination to state that the 
Administrator must notify both parties

of his or her determination regarding 
review of the hearing decision within 30 
calendar days after ‘‘receipt of the 
request for review’’ (versus the existing 
language which provides within 30 
calendar days of ‘‘receiving the request 
for review’’). These changes ensure 
consistency with the way deadlines are 
described in other regulatory provisions 
of Parts 422 and 423 governing contract 
determinations or the imposition of 
intermediate sanctions (including 
related appeals processes). 
17. Reopening of an Initial Contract 
Determination or Decision of a Hearing 
Officer or the Administrator Under Parts 
C and D (§ 422.696 and § 423.668) 
Sections 1857(h)(1)(b) and 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(F) of the Act provide the 
procedures requiring reasonable notice 
and opportunity for hearing when we 
terminate a sponsoring organization’s 
contract. Our current regulations at 
§ 422.696 and § 423.668 govern the 
reopening of an initial contract 
determination or decision of a Hearing 
Officer or the Administrator. More 
specifically, existing regulations at 
§ 422.696(a) and § 423.668(a) state that 
we may reopen and revise an ‘‘initial 
determination’’ upon our own motion. 
The term ‘‘initial determination’’ is not 
used elsewhere in Subpart N (Contract 
determinations and Appeals). Therefore, 
we are proposing to revise these 
regulations by replacing the language 
‘‘initial determination’’ with ‘‘contract 
determination’’ in the section headings 
of § 422.696 and § 423.668 and in the 
text of § 422.696(a) and § 423.668(a). 
18. Prohibition of MA and Part D 
Applications for 2 Years After a Mutual 
Termination (§ 422.503(b)(6) and 
§ 423.504(b)(5)) 
The regulations in § 422.503(b)(6) and 
§ 423.504(b)(5) currently provide that 
MA organizations and Part D sponsors 
that nonrenew contracts with CMS are 
considered unqualified to recontract 
with us for a period of 2 years, unless 
we identify circumstances that warrant 
special consideration. This is consistent 
with § 422.506(a)(4) and § 423.507(a)(3), 
which describe contract nonrenewal 
requirements and procedures. We 
interpret these provisions to apply to 
MA organizations and Part D sponsors 
that nonrenew all of their contracts with 
us in a given area for a given line of 
business (MA or Part D), thereby 
severing their contractual relationship 
with the Agency across all of their MA, 
Part D, or both lines of business in the 
area. We have not interpreted this 
provision to apply to an organization 
that, for instance, holds many MA 
contracts in an area but chooses to 
nonrenew fewer than all of those 
contracts. 
In practice, a voluntary nonrenewal of 
a contract by a Part D sponsor or MA 
organization is not dissimilar from an 
organization requesting and being 
granted a mutual termination of their 
contract under § 422.503 and § 423.508. 
The primary difference between the two 
events is often timing, whereby a 
nonrenewal request to take effect at the 
end of the current contract year must be 
received by us on or before the first 
Monday in June (the bid deadline), as 
specified in § 423.507(a)(2)(i) and 
§ 422.506(a)(2)(i). Once an organization 
submits a bid, it can no longer 
voluntarily nonrenew its contract for the 
following year. Rather, the Part D 
sponsor or MA organization must 
request a mutual contract termination. 
The later in the year the organization 
requests such a mutual termination for 
the following contract year, the more 
disruptive and difficult the process 
becomes. Particularly, once the 
organization completes all of its contract 
renewal obligations, such as signing a 
new bid attestation and a contract with 
CMS, where applicable, we begin 
including the new plan offerings under 
the contract on our Web site and in 
print materials to inform beneficiaries 
about the opportunity to enroll in those 
plan offerings for the upcoming contract 
year. To request a mutual contract 
termination late in the year once such 
information has become publicly 
available, marketed to beneficiaries, and 
beneficiaries have been given the 
opportunity to enroll is to create 
significant disruption for us and 
beneficiaries. Similarly, even greater 
disruption results from mutual 
terminations requested to take effect 
during the course of a contract year. 
Circumstances are sometimes such 
that the requesting MA organization or 
Part D sponsor is requesting the mutual 
termination because it realizes it would 
be significantly out of compliance with 
one or more program requirements 
should it keep the contract in place. 
Therefore, it is sometimes in the 
organization’s and our interest to 
execute the mutual termination. 
Nevertheless, the disruption is 
significant and completely the 
responsibility of the sponsor. Yet, 
currently the regulations are silent on 
whether the MA organization or Part D 
sponsor would be qualified to enter into 
new contracts with CMS in future years. 
We believe that a termination by mutual 
consent, which involves a termination 
by an MA organization or a Part D 
sponsor as well as by CMS, should be 
considered a termination of a contract 
for purposes of the 2-year ban on 
entering into new contracts under 
section 1857(c)(4)(A) of the Act, which 
is incorporated for Part D under section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 
For these reasons, we are proposing 
that as a condition of the consent to a 
mutual termination, we will prohibit the 
MA organization or Part D sponsor from 
applying for new contracts or service 
area expansions for a period of 2 years, 
absent circumstances that warrant 
special consideration as provided under 
section 1857(c)(4)(A) of the Act. Such 
language would be incorporated into the 
mutual termination consent agreement 
to be signed by both parties. 
Therefore, we are proposing to modify 
§ 423.508 by adding paragraph (e), 
which states that as a condition of the 
consent to a mutual termination, we 
will require as a provision of the 
termination agreement language 
prohibiting the Part D sponsor from 
applying for new contracts or service 
area expansions for a period of 2 years, 
absent circumstances warranting special 
consideration. Similarly, in 
§ 423.504(b), we propose to add a new 
paragraph (b)(6) stating that 
organizations may be qualified to apply 
for new contracts to the extent that they 
have not terminated a contract by 
mutual consent under which, as a 
condition of the consent, the Part D 
sponsor agreed that it was not eligible 
to apply for new contracts or service 
area expansions for a period of 2 years 
per § 423.508(e). To accomplish these 
changes, we propose to redesignate the 
current § 423.504(b)(6) to 
§ 423.504(b)(7). 
We propose to make the same 
modification to the MA regulations. 
Specifically, we are proposing to modify 
§ 422.508 by adding paragraph (c), 
which states that as a condition of the 
consent to a mutual termination, we 
will require as a provision of the 
termination agreement language 
prohibiting the MA organization from 
applying for new contracts or service 
area expansions for a period of 2 years, 
absent circumstances warranting special 
consideration. Similarly, in section 
§ 422.503(b), we propose to add a new 
paragraph (b)(7), stating that 
organizations may be qualified to apply 
for new contracts to the extent that they 
have not terminated a contract by 
mutual consent under which, as a 
condition of the consent, the MA 
organization agreed that it was not 
eligible to apply for new contracts or 
service area expansions for a period of 
2 years per § 422.508(c).

54654 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
B. Changes To Strengthen Beneficiary 
Protections 
This section includes provisions 
aimed at strengthening beneficiary 
protections under Parts C and D. Under 
Part D, we address proposals in the area 
of eligibility and enrollment policy, 
transition period requirements, 
coordination of benefits policy, 
retroactive claims adjustment 
reimbursements and recoveries, and use 
of standardized technology. We also 
propose to revise Part D rules regarding 
timeframes and responsibility for 
making redeterminations. 
Under Part C, we propose to revise 
our rules to— 
• Authorize us to annually establish 
an overall annual cap on member cost 
sharing; 
• Prohibit PPO, PFFS, and MSA plans 
from using compliance with voluntary 
prior notification procedures in 
determining cost-sharing amounts; 
• Establish new requirements for 
organization determinations; and 
• Offer two definitional revisions. 
In the area of Parts C and D marketing, 
we continue to monitor plans that use 
independent agents and brokers to 
ensure sponsoring organizations adhere 
to CMS requirements. In this rule, we 
solicit comments on options aimed at 
further protecting beneficiaries in this 
area. We also propose to strengthen our 
marketing requirements, distinguishing 
marketing materials from enrollee 
communications materials and 
mandating the use of standardized 
marketing material language and format 
to ensure clarity and accuracy among 
plan documents. We also clarify notice 
requirements, and propose that 
sponsoring organizations disclose 
information concerning the 
organization’s performance and 
compliance deficiencies to enable 
beneficiaries to make informed choices.

1. Broker and Agent Requirements 
Under Parts C and D 
Prior to January 1, 2006, beneficiaries 
could enroll in MA plans (then called 
Medicare+Choice plans) at any time 
throughout the year, effective the first 
day of the next month. Under those 
circumstances, most MA plans were 
able to employ a full-time sales force. 
Effective January 1, 2006, enrollment in 
MA plans and Part D prescription drug 
plans (PDPs) was limited to an annual 
coordinated election period in the fall, 
and in the case of MA plans only, the

open enrollment period during the first 
3 months of the year. As a result, 
maintaining a full-time, year-round 
sales force became untenable for many 
organizations, leading to increasing 
reliance on independent agents and 
brokers to educate beneficiaries about 
their Medicare health care options and 
enroll them in their products. 
In 2008, the Congress enacted the 
Medicare Improvements for Patients and 
Providers Act (Pub. L. 110–275) 
(MIPPA). In order to address concerns 
raised by reports of significant agent and 
broker misconduct in the market place, 
section 103 of MIPPA placed certain 
restrictions and limits on the marketing 
of MA plans and PDPs. Our objective in 
implementing the marketing 
requirements included in the MIPPA 
was to ensure that agent and broker 
compensation would not create 
financial incentives for agents and 
brokers to enroll Medicare beneficiaries 
in particular MA plans or PDPs based 
on considerations other than the best 
interests of the beneficiary. 
In the September 18, 2008 Federal 
Register, we published an interim final 
rule with comment period (73 FR 
54226) implementing the MIPPA 
compensation provisions. In the 
November 14, 2008 Federal Register, we 
published the Medicare Advantage & 
Prescription Drug Programs: 
Clarification of Compensation Plans 
interim final rule with comment period 
(73 FR 67406), which clarified and 
modified the September 18, 2008 rule in 
part because we believed that plans 
were misinterpreting certain provisions 
of the September 18, 2008 interim final 
rule. Because so little time has passed 
since the publication of these rules, we 
believe it is too soon to fully evaluate 
whether these changes involving agent 
compensation have achieved the 
MIPPA’s goal of creating incentives for 
agents and brokers to assist beneficiaries 
with selecting plans based on their 
health care needs rather than on agent 
or broker financial interests. 
We recognize the important role that 
agents and brokers play in assisting 
beneficiaries with accessing and 
understanding plan information, making 
informed choices, and enrolling them in 
Medicare health plans. However, we 
remain concerned about the inherent 
financial incentives independent agents 
and brokers have when selling Medicare 
products. For this reason, we are 
continuing to explore the most effective 
means of providing Medicare health 
plan and drug plan information and 
enrollment assistance in order to ensure 
that beneficiaries select the plan that 
best meets their needs, including 
whether additional changes are needed 
in the requirements related to plan 
sponsors’ use of agents and brokers. 
Our overarching objective is that with 
any potential further limitations on 
independent agent and broker activity 
beneficiaries will continue to have the 
assistance they need to make health care 
choices best suited to their needs. We 
provide a number of tools, both through 
our print publications and our online 
resources (Medicare Options Compare, 
MPDPF, and Online Enrollment Center) 
to assist beneficiaries with their health 
care decisions, and we continuously 
seek to improve these tools. We are 
exploring whether State Health 
Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) 
have the capacity to serve significantly 
more Medicare beneficiaries. We also 
are considering limiting the use of 
independent agents and brokers by MA 
organizations to certain times of the 
year, specifically, the open enrollment 
period (OEP) and annual enrollment 
period (AEP), or to selected groups of 
beneficiaries. Limiting the use of 
independent agents and brokers to the 
OEP and AEP or to a subset of 
beneficiaries would allow us to better 
focus our monitoring efforts throughout 
the year, while still recognizing the role 
independent agents and brokers play in 
assisting beneficiaries with obtaining 
and evaluating plan information 
(including year to year plan benefit 
changes), making informed choices, and 
enrolling in Medicare health plans. 
While we are not proposing any 
changes at this time, we are seeking 
comments on the approaches discussed 
in this section, as well as other potential 
solutions to ensure that beneficiaries 
receive adequate assistance in 
understanding their choices and with 
enrollment, including potential 
alternative roles for agents and brokers. 
Any changes resulting from comments 
to this section will be implemented 
through future notice and comment 
rulemaking. 
2. Beneficiary Communications 
Materials Under Parts C and D 
(§ 422.2260, § 422.2262, § 423.2260, and 
§ 423.2262) 
Section 1851(h) of the Act, which is 
made applicable to Part D in section 
1860D–1(b)(1)(vi) of the Act, established 
requirements regarding the review and 
approval of marketing materials by MA 
organizations and PDP sponsors. 
Sections 422.2260 and 423.2260 of the 
regulations define marketing materials 
as informational materials targeted to 
Medicare beneficiaries which may 
include the following: 
• General audience materials such 
as— 
++ General circulation brochures; 
++ Newspapers; 
++ Magazines; 
++ Television; 
++ Radio; 
++ Billboards; 
++ Yellow pages; or 
++ The Internet. 
• Marketing representative materials 
such as scripts or outlines for 
telemarketing or other presentations. 
• Presentation materials such as 
slides and charts. 
• Promotional materials such as 
brochures or leaflets, including 
materials for circulation by third parties 
(for example, physicians or other 
providers); 
• Membership communication 
materials such as— 
++ Membership rules; 
++ Subscriber agreements; 
++ Member handbooks; and 
++ Wallet card instructions to 
enrollees. 
• Letters to members about— 
++ Contractual changes; 
++ Changes in providers; 
++ Premiums; 
++ Benefits, plan procedures, and 
membership; or 
++ Claims processing activities. 
Sections 422.2260, 422.2262, 
423.2260, and 423.2262 codify 
requirements regarding CMS review and 
approval of marketing materials. Given 
a number of years of experience in 
implementing these processes under 
both the Part C and Part D programs, we 
have found that our definition of the 
term ‘‘marketing materials’’ is so broad 
as to encompass plan notification 
materials that are often either situational 
materials or beneficiary specific 
customized communications. As these 
materials are considered marketing 
materials, they are subject to our rules 
regarding review, distribution, and 
approval in § 422.2262 and § 423.2262. 
However, we have found that CMS 
Regional Office review and approval 
procedures for situational marketing 
materials should follow a separate 
review process determined by CMS. 
Materials that are beneficiary specific 
letters are not considered to be 
marketing materials such as— 
• Part D explanations of benefits 
(EOBs); 
• Notifications about claims 
processing changes or errors; and 
• Other one-time or situational, 
beneficiary specific letters to current 
enrollees. 
Therefore, we propose to revise 
§ 422.2260 and § 423.2260 to exclude 
materials about claims processing 
activities from the definition of 
marketing materials. We also propose to 
add a definition of current enrollee

communications materials not to be 
considered marketing materials 
encompassing information targeted to 
situational or beneficiary-specific 
circumstances, including claims 
processing issues and other one-time 
communications about operations. In 
addition, we propose to revise 
§ 422.2262 and § 423.2262 to specify 
that, while current enrollee 
communications are not subject to the 
statutory requirement that applies to 
marketing materials (that is, that they be 
submitted to CMS for review prior to 
use), we retain the right to review them, 
and their use could be disapproved by 
CMS, or disapproved unless 
modifications are made. We believe 
these changes will streamline the review 
and approval of beneficiary 
communication notices to current 
members. 
3. Required Use of Standardized Model 
Materials Under Parts C and D 
(§ 422.2262 and § 423.2262) 
Section 1851(h) of the Act establishes 
standards for review and approval of 
marketing materials. Section 1860D– 
1(B)(1)(vi) of the Act requires CMS to 
use rules ‘‘similar to (and coordinated 
with)’’ the foregoing marketing rules set 
forth in section 1851(h) with respect to 
Part D marketing. Specifically, 
organizations may not distribute 
marketing materials unless they have 
been submitted to CMS for review. 
Materials submitted for such review are 
deemed to be approved unless 
disapproved within 45 days, or 10 days 
when using model language specified by 
CMS. In reviewing marketing materials 
or election forms under § 422.2264 and 
§ 423.2264, we ensure that marketing 
materials are provided in a format (with 
appropriate print size, as applicable) 
specified by CMS and will use standard 
terminology specified by CMS. 
Our current marketing materials 
submission and review process 
encourages MAOs and PDP sponsors to 
use model materials to expedite the 
review and approval process. The model 
documents contain language provided 
by CMS, including language that is 
optional (or that can be modified), for 
plan use. Under this arrangement, 
MAOs and Part D sponsors may submit 
customized materials that reflect 
preferred word choices or phrasing tied 
to corporate messaging. 
As marketing materials that describe 
plan benefits are critical to ensuring that 
beneficiaries make the best health care 
decisions for their particular needs, it is 
imperative that plan materials are 
accurate, free of errors, and comparable 
across MAOs and PDPs. Accordingly, in 
order to reduce variability of marketing 
materials and to ensure documents are 
more accurate and understandable to 
beneficiaries, we propose to move 
toward greater standardization of the 
information provided in plan marketing 
materials. Specifically, we are proposing 
to revise § 422.2262 and § 423.2262 to 
require that MAOs and PDP sponsors 
use standardized marketing material 
language and format, without 
modification, in every instance in which 
we provide standardized language and 
formatting. We provide MAOs and PDP 
sponsors with standardized marketing 
materials through the annual Call Letter 
or Health Plan Management System 
(HPMS) memoranda. We believe this 
change would ensure beneficiaries 
receive more accurate and comparable 
information to make informed decisions 
about their health care options. This 
proposed change will also ensure 
increased efficiencies and greater 
consistency in our marketing material 
review protocols and processes. 
4. Involuntary Disenrollment for Failure 
To Pay Plan Premiums Under Parts C 
and D (§ 422.74 and § 423.44) 
Section 1851(g)(3)(B)(i) of the Act 
provides that MA organizations may 
terminate those MA plan enrollees who 
fail to pay basic and supplemental 
premiums within the grace period 
established by the MA organization. 
Section 1860D–1(b)(1)(B) of the Act 
generally directs us to use disenrollment 
rules for Part D sponsors that are similar 
to those established for MA 
organizations under section 1851 of the 
Act. Consistent with these sections of 
the Act, the Parts C and D regulations 
set forth our requirements with respect 
to involuntary disenrollment procedures 
under § 422.74 and § 423.44, 
respectively. 
Currently, § 422.74(d)(1)(i)(B) 
specifies that an MA organization must 
provide, at minimum, a 1-month grace 
period before disenrolling individuals 
for failure to pay the premium. 
Similarly, under current regulations at 
§ 423.44(b)(1)(i) and § 423.44(d)(1), Part 
D sponsors may disenroll an individual 
from a PDP for failing to pay PDP 
premiums on a timely basis, using the 
process set forth in the regulations. 
Unlike the statute, the Part D regulations 
do not specifically use the term ‘‘grace 
period,’’ but we have interpreted the 
regulations in the Medicare Managed 
Care Manual provisions (Section 40.3.1 
of the Enrollment Chapter) to require 
that organizations provide beneficiaries 
a grace period of not less than 1 month, 
beginning on the first day of the month 
for which the premium is unpaid, before 
disenrollment for failure to pay 
premiums timely. For both Parts C and 
D, these involuntary disenrollments are 
not mandatory; thus, organizations may 
choose to implement longer grace 
periods or forego involuntary 
disenrollments entirely. 
However, MA organizations and Part 
D sponsors that choose to disenroll 
enrollees for failure to pay premiums 
must notify the enrollee of the 
delinquency and allow the enrollee an 
opportunity to resolve the delinquency 
within 30 days. Further, the 
organization or sponsor must also be 
able to demonstrate to us that it has 
made reasonable efforts to collect the 
unpaid premium amounts. Given the 
time required to notify the enrollee of 
the delinquency, for the enrollee to 
make payment, and for the payment to 
be received by the organization in cases 
where the organization has established 
the minimum grace period, the actual 
amount of time the enrollee has to 
resolve the delinquency may be less 
than one month. 
A beneficiary who is disenrolled from 
his or her MA or Part D plan for failure 
to pay premiums is not eligible for a 
special enrollment period based on that 
disenrollment. This beneficiary may be 
unable to enroll in another plan until 
the next annual election period in the 
fall. This may leave a significant gap in 
coverage for MA–PD and PDP enrollees, 
since their disenrollment will likely 
leave them without prescription drug 
coverage for the remainder of the year, 
and in addition they potentially face a 
late enrollment penalty (LEP) should 
they subsequently choose to re-enroll in 
some type of Medicare prescription drug 
coverage. Given the possible risk to the 
health status of individuals that lose 
prescription drug coverage, as well as 
the LEP consequences, we propose to 
codify in regulations a stronger version 
of our existing policy. 
Therefore, we are proposing to amend 
the regulations at § 422.74(d)(1) and 
§ 423.44(d)(1) regarding disenrollment 
for nonpayment of premium to require 
a minimum grace period of 2 months 
before any involuntary disenrollment 
associated with failure to pay a 
premium. We further propose to codify 
the aforementioned manual provision 
regarding the beginning of the grace 
period for Part D. We believe that a 2- 
month period will provide adequate 
time for organizations to respond to 
instances in which individuals fail to 
pay their premiums, and for affected 
enrollees to take steps to remedy the 
situation and avoid disenrollment. We 
note that organizations would still be 
able to offer a more generous grace 
period than provided in the regulation, 
if they so choose.

5. Maximum Allowable Out-of-Pocket 
Cost Amount for Medicare Parts A and 
B Services (§ 422.100) 
Under section 1852(b)(1) of the Act, 
we may not approve MA plans if we 
determine that the design of the plan 
and its benefits would substantially 
discourage enrollment by certain MA 
eligible individuals. Based on program 
experience and efforts to curb 
discriminatory benefit packages, we are 
proposing that all local MA plans 
include an annual out-of-pocket cap on 
members’ total cost-sharing liability for 
Part A and Part B services, the amount 
of which will be set annually by CMS. 
Given that regional PPO plans already 
are required to have an annual cap on 
member out-of-pocket costs and that 
many local MA plans already have such 
limits, we believe that requiring the 
inclusion of such a limit in plan design 
is necessary in order to avoid 
discouraging enrollment by individuals 
who utilize higher than average levels of 
health care services (that is, in order for 
a plan not do be discriminatory in 
violation of section 1852(b)(1) of the 
Act). 
While our concern about 
discriminatory or confusing benefit 
packages is longstanding, it has been 
particularly acute since the 
implementation of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. 
L. 108–173). Since that time, plan 
offerings have become increasingly 
complex in terms both of cost sharing 
design and rules governing the 
application of cost sharing. For 
example, Health Maintenance 
Organization (HMO) plans may have a 
point of service benefit that allows the 
enrollee to obtain services out of 
network, but for higher cost-sharing 
levels. Preferred provider organization 
(PPO) plans are required to cover all 
plan services both in and out of network 
with typically higher out-of-network 
cost sharing. Members in private fee-for- 
service (PFFS) plans with a network 
may have differential cost sharing 
depending on whether they obtain 
services from a contracting or a deemed 
provider. Also, some coordinated care 
plans have introduced cost sharing 
‘‘tiers’’ by which enrollees may be 
assessed different cost-sharing amounts 
depending on, for example, the plan 
contracted hospital from which they 
seek care. Because MA plans can vary 
in numerous ways, we are increasingly 
concerned that, faced with too many 
complex choices, beneficiaries are 
unable to confidently compare health 
plans and make meaningful choices. 
Because of these concerns, in the last 
few years, we have used our authority 
under section 1852(b)(1) of the Act to 
scrutinize cost sharing and benefit 
designs offered by MA plans, and to 
require changes on a case by case basis 
where we found discriminatory cost- 
sharing. We also established out-of- 
pocket limits that, if adopted under an 
MA plan, would exempt the plan cost 
sharing from the same level of scrutiny 
it would otherwise receive. 
For example, during the period since 
2003, we have issued guidance: (1) 
Establishing an optional out-of-pocket 
maximum that plans could adopt which 
would result in less scrutiny of cost- 
sharing amounts for individual benefits 
under the plan; and (2) identifying 
certain health care services for special 
review that beneficiaries with higher 
than average health care needs are likely 
to need (for example, in-patient 
hospital, dialysis, skilled nursing 
facility (SNF), mental health services, 
Part B drugs and home health care). 
To implement this guidance, we 
established a comprehensive process to 
review the proposed cost sharing of 
each plan benefit package and 
determine if the cost sharing design 
discriminates against those beneficiaries 
with higher than average health care 
needs. Specifically, we have conducted 
outlier analyses for the purpose of 
reviewing whether cost sharing levels 
on submitted benefit designs are 
discriminatory. We review, for example, 
the distribution of cost sharing levels 
submitted by MA organizations to 
identify the levels in the upper tail end 
of the range. This analysis assists us in 
determining the cost sharing threshold 
above which we consider the level to be 
discriminatory. We believe these efforts 
have resulted in some improvements in 
reducing discriminatory cost sharing 
and transparency of plan design. For 
example, including regional PPO plans, 
nearly 60 percent of all current MA 
plans have an out-of-pocket cap on 
beneficiary cost sharing with some local 
plans excluding certain services. Based 
on this experience, we believe that both 
a standard and mandatory cap on 
member cost sharing for all local MA 
plan types is an important and 
necessary step to ensure that plans are 
not discriminatory and beneficiaries are 
protected from unreasonable financial 
costs regardless of which MA plan they 
enroll. 
Under our authority in section 
1852(b)(1)(A) of the Act to ensure 
against MA plans that discriminate, our 
authority under section 1856(b)(1) of the 
Act to establish MA standards by 
regulation, and our authority under 
section 1857(e)(1) of the Act to add 
necessary and appropriate contract 
terms, we propose to amend 
§ 422.100(f)(3) by adding a new 
paragraph (f)(4) to specify that all local 
MA plans must establish an out-of- 
pocket maximum inclusive of all 
Medicare Parts A and B services that is 
no greater than the annual limit set by 
CMS. The cap for local PPO plans will 
be inclusive of all in-network and out- 
of-network beneficiary cost sharing. The 
methodology for determining the out-of- 
pocket maximum for local MA plans 
will be similar to the methodology we 
used to establish the voluntary out-of- 
pocket maximum amount for MA plans 
for contract year 2010. The out-of- 
pocket maximum will be set at a certain 
percentile of expected FFS spending, 
and this amount will be estimated by 
the Office of the Actuary (OACT). We 
summarized the methodology used to 
determine the voluntary out-of-pocket 
maximum for MA plans for contract 
year 2010 on page 13 of the 2010 Call 
Letter. As summarized in the 2010 Call 
Letter, MA out-of-pocket threshold is 
based on a beneficiary-level distribution 
of Parts A and B cost sharing for 
individuals enrolled in Original 
Medicare. The CY 2010 out-of-pocket 
threshold of $3,400 represents the 85th 
percentile of projected beneficiary 
spending in 2010. We do not expect an 
impact on cost-sharing and premiums, 
all other things being equal, for plans 
that already provide for an out-of-pocket 
maximum. However, requiring all plans 
to have an out-of-pocket maximum will 
likely result in increases to premiums 
and/or cost-sharing, although we are not 
able to quantify the extent of this 
increase. We propose to continue to 
furnish information to MA organizations 
on our methodology and the amounts 
for acceptable out-of-pocket caps on a 
timely basis through the annual Call 
Letter or Health Plan Management 
System (HPMS) memoranda. We solicit 
comments on this approach. 
6. Maximum Allowable Cost Sharing 
Amount for Medicare Parts A and B 
Services and Prescription Drugs 
(§ 422.100, § 423.104) 
We have always reviewed cost sharing 
levels for individual services for the 
purpose of determining whether or not 
such levels are discriminatory. Based on 
our experience, in which we annually 
review the levels of cost sharing across 
all bids, we propose to amend our 
regulations on the general requirements 
related to MA benefits and qualified 
prescription drug coverage to expressly 
authorize us to establish cost sharing 
thresholds for individual services below 
which cost sharing will be considered 
non-discriminatory. We believe that

sharing thresholds in plans’ benefit 
designs affords greater predictability 
and protection against high out-of- 
pocket costs for beneficiaries with 
medical conditions that could result in 
exceptionally high out-of-pocket costs 
obligations, and further ensures that 
those beneficiaries are not discouraged 
from enrolling in an MA plan. 
Under Part C, we propose annually to 
review bid data to determine specific 
cost sharing levels for Medicare A and 
B services below which would not have 
a discriminatory effect, and therefore 
may be approved in an MA benefit 
package. Similarly, under Part D, we 
would annually review bid data to 
determine acceptable cost sharing tiers 
for non-defined standard benefit 
designs. We will furnish information to 
MA organizations and Part D sponsors 
on its methodology and the acceptable 
cost sharing amounts based on the prior 
year’s bids on a timely basis either 
through the annual Call Letter or Health 
Plan Management System (HPMS) 
memoranda. The methodology for 
determining the cost-sharing thresholds 
for Part A and B services will involve 
reviewing the prior year’s bid data, as 
well as actuarial equivalencies from 
original Medicare, to determine outliers. 
These amounts could be adjusted based 
on new bid submissions for the current 
year. 
We propose to determine these 
acceptable cost sharing levels based on 
factors such as distribution of cost 
sharing among submitted bids, 
comparison to Original Medicare cost 
sharing (in the case of Part C), and other 
factors that we find to assist in 
identifying discriminatory levels of cost 
sharing (for example, the number of 
tiers in the case of a Part D plan). A 
sponsoring organization’s cost sharing 
will be considered discriminatory if it is 
higher than the maximum level that we 
determine to be non-discriminatory for 
a particular service in the case of an MA 
plan or a drug cost tier in the case of a 
Part D plan. We will communicate 
expected discriminatory cost sharing 
thresholds to sponsoring organizations 
through the annual Call Letter or HPMS 
memoranda during the annual bid and 
benefit package review process. These 
thresholds will be based on the prior 
year’s experience and may be adjusted 
based on bid submissions for the current 
year. We solicit comment on this 
approach, including the extent to which 
we have provided sufficient clarity on 
how we determine whether cost-sharing 
levels are discriminatory. 
Organizations submitting MA plan or 
prescription drug plan bids found to 
have discriminatory cost sharing will 
have an opportunity to resubmit their 
bid and benefit package to comply with 
our non-discrimination requirements. 
We will annually evaluate our review 
process and the criteria we use to 
determine cost sharing discrimination 
and may make changes to ensure that 
beneficiaries are protected from 
discriminatory cost sharing. 
We propose to amend § 422.100 by 
adding a new paragraph (f)(5) to specify 
that cost sharing for Medicare A and B 
services may not exceed levels annually 
determined by CMS to be 
discriminatory. Additionally, we 
propose to revise § 423.104(d)(2) by 
adding a new paragraph (iii) to specify 
that tiered cost sharing for non-defined 
standard benefit designs may not exceed 
levels annually determined by CMS to 
be discriminatory. 
7. Prohibition on Prior Notification by 
PPO, PFFS and MSA Plans Under Part 
C (§ 422.2, § 422.4, and § 422.105(b)) 
In the preamble of the Medicare 
Program; Establishment of the Medicare 
Advantage Program final rule published 
in the January 28, 2005 Federal Register 
(70 FR 4598 through 4599), as well as 
in the 2009 and 2010 Call Letter, 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/ 
CallLetter.pdf and http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/ 
2010CallLetter.pdf, respectively, we 
provided guidance permitting local and 
regional PPO plans (for out-of-network 
services) and PFFS plans to provide for 
lower cost sharing amounts in cases in 
which an enrollee or provider 
voluntarily gives the MA organization 
with prior notification that the service 
will be received. We also made clear 
that PPO plans (for out-of-network 
services) and PFFS plans may not 
require such notice, or prior 
authorization or referrals from 
gatekeepers, as a condition of coverage 
in order to restrict an enrollee’s access 
to services. As stated below, Medical 
Savings Account (MSA) plans similarly 
may not impose prior authorization 
requirements as a condition of coverage. 
Under prior authorization, a plan 
requires an enrollee to seek its approval 
before obtaining services from a 
provider; if the enrollee does not obtain 
prior approval, then the plan can deny 
coverage for the service. We provided 
additional guidance to PPO and PFFS 
plans on how they must explain to 
current and prospective enrollees the 
plan’s standard cost sharing and the 
reduced cost sharing related to prior 
notification. 
However, since that time, we have 
become increasingly concerned about 
the use of prior notification by PPO and 
PFFS plans. Program experience has 
demonstrated that prior notification is 
confusing to beneficiaries, misleading in 
terms of disclosure of cost-sharing, and, 
in some instances, used inappropriately 
as a form of prior authorization. In the 
GAO report titled ‘‘Medicare Advantage: 
Characteristics, Financial Risks, and 
Disenrollment Rates of Beneficiaries in 
Private Fee-for-Service Plans (GAO–09– 
25),’’ the GAO noted that some PFFS 
plans it reviewed ‘‘inappropriately used 
the term prior authorization rather than 
pre-notification in the informational 
materials they distributed to 
beneficiaries, which may have caused 
confusion about beneficiaries’ financial 
risks.’’ We have concluded that the 
complexity of cost sharing designs using 
prior notification has made it more 
difficult for both enrollees and 
providers to understand the enrollee’s 
cost sharing obligation in advance of 
receiving services. Therefore, in order to 
reduce the complexity of MA plans’ cost 
sharing designs and improve 
transparency for both enrollees and 
providers, we are proposing to prohibit 
PPO plans (for out-of-network services) 
and PFFS plans from providing for 
lower cost-sharing where prior 
notification rules have been satisfied. 
We propose to revise § 422.4(a)(1)(v) 
and (a)(3) to provide that PPO and PFFS 
plans will be prohibited from 
establishing prior notification rules 
under which an enrollee is charged 
lower cost sharing when either the 
enrollee or the provider notifies the plan 
before a service is furnished. 
We also propose to prohibit MSA 
plans from establishing prior 
notification rules. The definition of a 
MSA plan in section 1859(b)(3)(A)(iii) of 
the Act ensures open access to services 
for MSA enrollees without restriction to 
a provider network and without prior 
authorization reviews for health care 
services. MSA plans may have networks 
of providers, but may not restrict an 
enrollee’s access to those network 
providers. We believe that prior 
notification rules established by MSA 
plans would also be confusing to 
enrollees of those plans and have 
similar negative effects as those 
described above for PPO and PFFS 
plans. We propose to modify 
§ 422.4(a)(2) such that MSA plans will 
also be prohibited from establishing 
prior notification rules under which an 
enrollee is charged lower cost sharing 
when either the enrollee or the provider 
notifies the plan before a service is 
furnished.

54659 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
(70 FR 4617 through 4619), we 
discussed rules related to point of 
service (POS) options that are offered by 
some MA organizations. We stated that 
PPOs may offer a POS-like benefit under 
which beneficiary cost sharing would be 
less than it would otherwise be for non- 
network provider services, but still 
might be greater than it would be for in- 
network provider services, provided an 
enrollee follows preauthorization, pre- 
certification, or prenotification rules 
before receiving out-of-network services. 
We also noted that such 
preauthorization, pre-certification, or 
prenotification cannot be a necessary 
condition for receipt of, or required MA 
plan reimbursement for, out-of-network 
covered services by a PPO enrollee, but 
that it could act as a financial incentive 
(by lowering the normal out-of-network 
cost sharing that would otherwise 
apply) to an enrollee to voluntarily 
participate. Similar to our concerns 
about the use of prior notification rules 
by PPO and PFFS plans, as discussed 
above, we believe that the complexity of 
cost sharing designs for PPO plans with 
a POS-like benefit make it more difficult 
for both enrollees and providers to 
understand the enrollee’s cost sharing 
obligation in advance of receiving 
services. In order to reduce the 
complexity of PPO plans’ cost sharing 
designs and improve transparency for 
both enrollees and providers, we are 
proposing to prohibit PPO plans from 
offering a POS-like benefit. We propose 
to revise the definition of POS in § 422.2 
and § 422.105(b) to indicate the only 
HMOs may offer a POS benefit. The 
proposed change is consistent with 
section 1851(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, 
which states that an HMO may include 
a POS option. 
Although PPO (for out-of-network 
services), PFFS, and MSA plans may not 
impose prior authorization and referral 
requirements as conditions for covering 
services, enrollees and providers have 
the right to request a written advance 
coverage determination from the plan, 
in accordance with Subpart M of Part 
422, before an enrollee receives a 
service in order to confirm that the 
service is medically necessary and will 
be covered by the plan. 
8. Requirements for LIS Eligibility 
Under Part D (§ 423.773) 
Section 423.773(c) specifies that the 
individuals treated as full subsidy 
eligible individuals include the 
following: 
• Full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals; 
• Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) recipients under Title XVI of the 
Act; and 
• Individuals eligible for Medicaid as 
a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary, 
Specified Low-Income Medicare 
Beneficiary, or a Qualifying Individual 
under a State’s Medicaid plan. 
In § 423.773(c)(2), we are proposing to 
amend the length of the period for 
which individuals are re-deemed 
eligible for the full low income subsidy 
to conform with guidance we issued in 
section 40.2.2 of Chapter 13 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual. Section 423.773(c)(2) currently 
specifies that a full subsidy eligible 
individual is deemed eligible for the full 
subsidy for a period up to 1 year. 
However, in practice, the period of 
deemed eligibility varies from as little as 
7 months to as long as eighteen months, 
depending on when the individual 
attained deemed status (that is, became 
eligible for Medicaid, a Medicare 
Savings Program, or for SSI). 
Every year, we review data from State 
Medicaid Agencies and the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) sent to 
us in July and August, respectively, to 
determine whether individuals 
currently deemed eligible for the 
subsidy should continue to be deemed 
(that is, ‘‘re-deemed’’) eligible for the 
subsidy. This allows us sufficient time 
to update individuals’ records in our 
systems, if necessary, and to notify them 
if they are losing deemed status, so that 
they can take the appropriate steps to 
apply for the subsidy, in time for 
coverage to be effective at the start of the 
new calendar year. 
When we are reviewing data in July 
and August, we also identify 
individuals who are newly eligible for 
Medicaid, a Medicare Savings Program, 
or SSI, and deem these individuals 
eligible for the subsidy for the 
remainder of the current calendar year. 
We also redeem these individuals for 
the subsidy for the next calendar year, 
because we do not have sufficient time 
in the final months of the year to 
conduct a separate redeeming process 
for these individuals. If we waited to 
redeem these beneficiaries after the start 
of the calendar year, they could incur 
greatly increased premium liability and 
cost sharing amounts at the start of the 
new calendar year than they would have 
otherwise. 
For example, if a State Medicaid 
Agency submits data to CMS indicating 
an individual is eligible for Medicaid in 
March of a given year, and that 
individual is Part D eligible, we deem 
that individual eligible for the Part D 
low income subsidy from March 1st 
through December 31st of that year. We 
redeem that individual for the following 
calendar year only if we receive 
subsequent information from the State 
or SSA indicating that the individual 
remains eligible for Medicaid, a 
Medicare Savings Program, or SSI. 
On the other hand, if a State submits 
data to CMS indicating that an 
individual is eligible for Medicaid in 
July or a later month of a given year, and 
the individual is Part D eligible, we 
deem the individual eligible for the Part 
D subsidy for the remainder of that 
calendar year and all of the following 
calendar year. (See section 40.2.2 of 
Chapter 13 of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual.) Therefore, we 
propose to amend § 423.773(c)(2) to 
indicate that the deeming will be, at a 
minimum, for the following periods: If 
deemed status is determined between 
January 1st and June 30th of a calendar 
year, the individual is deemed subsidy 
eligible for the remainder of the 
calendar year. If deemed status is 
determined between July 1st and 
December 31st of a calendar year, the 
individual is deemed subsidy eligible 
for the remainder of the calendar year 
and the next calendar year. We believe 
this change will streamline the 
deeming/redeeming process and 
decrease the administrative burden on 
agencies and subsidy eligible 
individuals. 
9. Enrollment of Full Subsidy Eligible 
Individuals and Other Subsidy Eligible 
Individuals Under Part D (§ 423.34) 
In the January 28, 2005 Federal 
Register, when we issued the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit final rule (70 
FR 4193), we added § 423.34 to describe 
our procedures for enrollment of full- 
benefit dual eligible individuals. We 
discussed how full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals are enrolled, which PDPs 
they are assigned to, and the effective 
date of their enrollment. As noted in the 
preamble to the final regulation, 
enrollment of other low-income subsidy 
(LIS) eligible individuals would also be 
conducted, and details would be issued 
in operational guidance. However, we 
did not incorporate into the initial Part 
D regulations further detail about the 
enrollment procedures that would apply 
to this remaining population of LIS- 
eligible individuals. 
Section 1860D–1(b)(1)(A) of the Act 
directs the Secretary to establish a 
process for the enrollment of Part D 
eligible individuals. As we indicated in 
the preamble to the January 28, 2005 
final rule (70 FR 4209), while the statute 
does not explicitly provide for the auto- 
enrollment of other LIS-eligible 
individuals into the Medicare Part D 
program, we believe that enrolling these 
individuals clearly is consistent not 
only with statutory intent but also with 
the intent of the individuals themselves.

54660 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
The express purpose of applying for the 
Part D low-income subsidy is to obtain 
prescription drugs on a subsidized 
basis, which can only be accomplished 
through enrollment in a Part D plan. 
Therefore, we established a separate 
enrollment process for these individuals 
known as ‘‘facilitated enrollment.’’ We 
randomly assign these individuals to a 
PDP in their area with a premium below 
the low-income benchmark and notify 
these individuals that they may choose 
a Part D plan on their own and that if 
they do not choose a plan, we will 
enroll them in a plan in their area. We 
have been carrying out the ‘‘facilitated’’ 
enrollment process for more than 3 
years without objections from 
beneficiaries or from the advocacy 
community; in fact, we believe that 
many individuals are under the 
mistaken impression that being 
approved for the subsidy actually 
equates with enrolling in a plan, so we 
believe our proposal will help rectify 
that problem. (See section 30.1.4 of 
Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual for more 
information about facilitated 
enrollment). 
Based on this experience, we believe 
it would be appropriate to codify in 
regulation the enrollment procedures 
that we use for these individuals, which 
are similar to those specified in the 
regulation for the dual eligible 
population. We believe that our 
regulations would be more accurate and 
complete if they specifically addressed 
this population. Thus, we are proposing 
to amend § 423.34 to reflect the 
guidance we have issued in Chapter 3 
of the Prescription Drug Program 
Manual. Specifically, we are proposing 
to include information on how we 
enroll all LIS-eligible individuals, 
including full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals. 
We are proposing the following 
revisions to § 423.34: 
• In § 423.34(a), we propose to 
expand the general rule to refer to all 
LIS-eligible individuals, so that the rest 
of that section applies not only to full- 
benefit dual eligible individuals, but 
also to all LIS-eligible individuals. 
• In § 423.34(b), we would retain the 
definition of full-benefit dual eligible 
individual, and add a definition for 
‘‘low-income subsidy eligible 
individual.’’ 
• We propose to amend the paragraph 
heading of § 423.34(c) to indicate that 
this paragraph describes the process we 
use to reassign LIS individuals during 
the annual coordinated election period. 
We would indicate that the 
reassignment process applies to certain 
low-income subsidy eligible individuals 
(that is, not just full benefit dual eligible 
individuals). 
• We are proposing to revise the 
paragraph heading of § 423.34(d) from 
‘‘Automatic Enrollment Rules’’ to 
‘‘Enrollment Rules.’’ We are proposing 
this change to reflect the inclusion of 
full subsidy and other subsidy eligible 
groups in this enrollment process, in 
addition to full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals. In our guidance, we refer to 
the process of enrolling full-benefit dual 
eligible individuals as ‘‘automatic 
enrollment,’’ and the process for other 
LIS eligibles as ‘‘facilitated enrollment.’’ 
(See section 30.1.4 of Chapter 3 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual.) 
• We propose to amend § 423.34(e) to 
indicate that the rules regarding 
declining enrollment and disenrollment 
also apply to all LIS-eligible 
individuals. 
• In § 423.34(f), we would clarify that 
the paragraph heading and contents of 
this paragraph are limited to the 
effective date of enrollment for full- 
benefit eligible individuals. We propose 
to amend § 423.34(f)(3) to specify that, 
for individuals who are eligible for Part 
D and subsequently become eligible for 
Medicaid on or after January 1, 2006, 
the effective date of enrollment would 
be the first day of the month the 
individual becomes eligible for both 
Medicaid and Medicare Part D. 
• In § 423.34(g), we propose adding a 
new paragraph to specify that the 
effective date for low income subsidy 
eligibles who are not full benefit dual 
eligibles would be no later than the first 
day of the second month after we 
determine that the individual meets the 
criteria for enrollment into a PDP under 
this section. This change conforms to 
section 30.1.4 of Chapter 3 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual. Unlike full benefit dual eligible 
individuals who may have retroactive 
Part D coverage, these individuals have 
only prospective Part D coverage. 
Although we believe that all these 
provisions will benefit the LIS-eligible 
population, we recognize that concerns 
have been raised about the impact of the 
current random auto-enrollment process 
on affected beneficiaries. For example, 
focus groups of seniors suggest the 
possibility that some auto-enrolled 
beneficiaries may not realize they have 
been enrolled in a drug plan or that they 
have been reassigned to a different drug 
plan. We are committed to taking 
appropriate steps to improve this 
process. Thus, we welcome comments 
related to all aspects of these 
procedures, including comments on 
issues such as the following: 
• The efficacy of the existing auto- 
enrollment and facilitated enrollment 
procedures, and suggestion for 
improving these procedures; 
• Ways to assess the impact of these 
procedures on the dual eligible and LIS 
population, including the costs, 
benefits, and potential unintended 
consequences. For example, is it 
possible that seniors who are LIS- 
eligible but not eligible for Medicaid 
will not realize that they have been 
auto-enrolled into a drug plan? Is there 
any possibility that auto-enrolling these 
individuals could ever lead to 
delinquencies in payments? Given that 
LIS-eligible individuals are auto- 
enrolled into plans with premiums 
below the benchmark, we do not believe 
these individuals would ever become 
subject to premium issues or liable for 
other such costs that they are not aware 
of in advance. However, we welcome 
comment on whether the possibility 
exists and, if so, how payment 
delinquencies should be handled in this 
vulnerable population. 
• How we can better assist 
beneficiaries in identifying plan choices 
that best suit their individual drug 
needs, and encourage them to make an 
active election. 
10. Special Enrollment Periods Under 
Part D (§ 423.380) 
Consistent with the changes in 
§ 423.34, we are proposing to expand 
the special enrollment period described 
in § 423.38(c)(4), which currently 
applies to full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals, to all LIS-eligible 
individuals. This change is consistent 
with our authority in section 1860D– 
1(b)(3)(C) of the Act and would conform 
our regulations to current practice as 
reflected in CMS guidance in section 
20.3.8, item 7, of chapter 3 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual. 
11. Transition Process Under Part D 
(§ 423.120(b)(3)) 
Section 1860D–11(d)(2)(B) of the Act 
gives the Secretary authority similar to 
that of the Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management with respect to 
health benefits plans under chapter 89 
of title 5, United States Code. This 
includes the authority to ‘‘prescribe 
reasonable minimum standards for 
health benefits plans.’’ In addition, 
section 1860D–11(e)(2)(D) of the Act 
prohibits us from approving a plan if 
‘‘the design of the plan and its benefits 
(including any formulary and tiered 
formulary structure) are likely to 
substantially discourage enrollment by 
certain part D eligible individuals.’’

54661 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Under the authority of section 1860D– 
11 of the Act, we established a 
requirement in the January 28, 2005 
final rule implementing the Part D 
program that requires sponsors of Part D 
plans to provide for an appropriate 
transition process for new enrollees 
prescribed Part D drugs that are not on 
its plan’s formulary (70 FR 4264). We 
further specified in regulation that the 
transition policy must be consistent 
with written policy guidelines and other 
CMS instructions. The transition 
requirement is codified in at 
§ 423.120(b)(3). 
Following publication of the 
regulation, we issued guidance in 2005 
on what constituted an appropriate 
transition process for new Part D 
enrollees. We noted in our guidance that 
an appropriate transition process was 
one that balances the protection of 
certain vulnerable populations with the 
flexibility necessary for Part D plans to 
develop a benefit design that promotes 
beneficiary choice and affordable access 
to medically necessary drugs. We 
updated the transition guidance for 
contract year 2007 as part of the 2007 
Call letter, noting that the transition 
guidance represented a minimum set of 
standards for a Part D sponsor transition 
process. This guidance was 
incorporated into Chapter 6 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual located at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/downloads/ 
R2PDBv2.pdf. 
Our experience has shown that 
transition processes represent an 
important enrollee protection to ensure 
access to needed Part D drugs. Given the 
movement from year to year of some 
dual eligible beneficiaries due to 
reassignment, and the annual bidding 
cycle related to Part D plan offerings in 
which benefits and formularies may be 
modified, we believe that some 
protections are necessary for plan 
enrollees with immediate prescription 
needs who experience a change in 
enrollment or who experience formulary 
changes under their existing plan at the 
beginning of a contract year. These 
protections are particularly important 
when an individual first presents at a 
participating pharmacy with a 
prescription for a drug that is not on the 
formulary, unaware of what is covered 
by the plan or of the sponsor’s 
exceptions process for providing access 
to Part D drugs that are not on the plan’s 
formulary. For example, a full-benefit 
dual eligible enrollee who is auto- 
enrolled into a plan may not make an 
affirmative choice based on review of a 
plan’s benefit relative to his existing 
medications needs. For these types of 
situations, we directed Part D sponsors 
to have systems capabilities to allow 
them to provide a one time, temporary 
supply of non-formulary Part D drugs 
(including Part D drugs that are on a 
sponsor’s formulary but require prior 
authorization or step therapy under a 
sponsor’s utilization management rules) 
in order to accommodate the immediate 
needs of an enrollee, as well as to allow 
the sponsor and/or the enrollee 
sufficient time to work out with the 
prescriber an appropriate switch to a 
therapeutically equivalent medication 
or the completion of an exception 
request to maintain coverage of an 
existing drug based on medical 
necessity reasons. Our guidance has 
developed over time in response to 
these concerns, and we believe it strikes 
the right balance between enrollee 
protection and plan flexibility. 
Given the importance of our transition 
policy as an enrollee protection— 
particularly for auto-assigned and 
reassigned beneficiaries who did not 
affirmatively choose a Part D plan—we 
propose to codify in regulation certain 
policies from our guidance on the 
necessary elements of a plan transition 
process. We also believe that any plan 
that fails to meet its transition policy 
requirements discourages enrollment (or 
re-enrollment) by Part D eligible 
individuals that may currently be taking 
prescription drugs that are not on the 
plan’s formulary. Accordingly, we 
propose that a Part D sponsor must 
provide for a transition for the 
following: 
• New enrollees into PDPs following 
the annual coordinated election period; 
• Newly eligible Medicare enrollees 
from other coverage; 
• Individuals who switch from one 
plan to another after the start of the 
contract year; and 
• Current enrollees remaining in the 
plan who are affected by formulary 
changes from one contract year to the 
next. 
Our experience thus far has shown 
that these groups represent the 
minimum target populations that are 
most likely to require protections to 
ensure immediate access to their 
prescription drug benefit. 
We also propose, consistent with our 
current guidance, that a Part D sponsor’s 
transition process requirements be 
applicable to non-formulary drugs, 
meaning both: (1) Part D drugs that are 
not on a sponsor’s formulary; and (2) 
Part D drugs that are on a sponsor’s 
formulary but require prior 
authorization or step therapy under a 
plan’s utilization management rules. 
The latter is included because a 
formulary drug to which access is 
restricted via utilization management 
requirements is essentially equivalent to 
a non-formulary Part D drug to the 
extent that the relevant utilization 
management requirements are not met 
for a particular enrollee. 
Additionally, we propose, consistent 
with our current guidance, to codify the 
timeframes for the transition process 
and the days’ supply limit for a 
transition fill of an enrollee’s 
medication. Our guidance was premised 
on the position that it made sense to 
limit the amount of time during which 
a transition process is applicable to new 
enrollees to the first 3 months under the 
plan as we believed an enrollee 
unfamiliar with his or her plan’s 
formulary requirements would likely to 
present with a prescription during the 
first few months enrolled. We also 
propose to codify the transition process 
timeframe to apply during the first 90 
days of coverage under a new plan. This 
90-day timeframe would apply to retail, 
home infusion, long-term care, and 
mail-order pharmacies. 
We also propose to require plans to 
provide a temporary supply of drugs 
under their transition process. As we 
noted in our original transition guidance 
to Part D plan sponsors in Chapter 6 of 
the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual, providing a temporary supply 
represented the most efficient method of 
triaging requests for filling initial 
prescriptions of non-formulary drugs for 
large numbers of new enrollees who, 
despite education efforts to make them 
aware of the plan’s benefit, may not be 
aware of which drugs are listed on the 
plan’s formulary. Consistent with 
Chapter 6, we propose that Part D plan 
sponsors must ensure that the one-time, 
temporary supply of non-formulary Part 
D drugs requested during the first 90 
days of coverage in an outpatient setting 
must be for at least 30 days of 
medication, unless the prescription is 
written by a prescriber for less than 30 
days, in which case the Part D sponsor 
must allow multiple fills to provide up 
to a total of 30 days of medication. For 
a new enrollee in a Long term Care 
(LTC) facility, the temporary supply 
may be for up to 31 days (unless the 
prescription is written for less than 31 
days), consistent with the dispensing 
practices in the LTC industry. In 
addition, due to the often complex 
needs of LTC residents that often 
involve multiple drugs and necessitate 
longer periods in order to successfully 
transition to new drug regimens, 
sponsors must honor multiple fills of 
non-formulary Part D drugs, as 
necessary during the entire length of the 
90-day transition period. This is 
particularly important if transitions to

formulary drugs have not been 
effectuated prior to the refills. We 
propose to require up to a 31-day 
transition supply for enrollees in an 
LTC facility given that many LTC 
pharmacies and facilities dispense 
medication in 31-day increments. Thus, 
a Part D sponsor would be required to 
provide a LTC resident enrolled in its 
Part D plan at least a 31 day supply of 
a prescription when presenting in the 
first 90 days of enrollment (unless the 
prescription is written for less) with 
refills provided, if needed, up to a 93 
day supply. 
In addition to codifying the preceding 
requirements, we also propose to take 
the opportunity in this rulemaking to 
clarify our expectations of sponsors 
with respect to providing transition 
notices. Based on our experience 
overseeing the Part D program, we have 
learned that a successful transition 
process is contingent upon informing 
enrollees and their caretakers about 
their options for ensuring that enrollees’ 
medical needs are safely accommodated 
within a Part D sponsor’s formulary. An 
enrollee who receives a temporary 
supply of a non-formulary Part D drug 
at a network pharmacy might simply 
assume that, by virtue of filling his or 
her prescription, the plan will cover that 
drug for the remainder of the contract 
year. For this reason, we are proposing 
to require sponsors to provide enrollees 
with appropriate notice regarding their 
transition process within a reasonable 
amount of time after providing a 
temporary supply of non-formulary Part 
D drugs (including Part D drugs that are 
on a sponsor’s formulary but require 
prior authorization or step therapy 
under a sponsor’s utilization 
management rules). 
Our guidance specifies that Part D 
sponsors send a written notice, via U.S. 
First Class mail, to each enrollee who 
receives a transition fill. This standard 
is consistent with our requirement that 
other enrollee communications, 
including formulary change notices and 
explanations of benefits, be sent via U.S. 
First Class mail. In addition, our 
guidance directs sponsors to send this 
notice to each affected enrollee within 
3 business days of the temporary fill. 
Our rationale for this turnaround time is 
that it is necessary in order to provide 
an affected enrollee with sufficient 
time—especially in light of our 30-day 
transition fill policy in the outpatient 
setting to work with his or her 
prescriber to switch to a therapeutically 
equivalent drug that is on the plan’s 
formulary or to process an exceptions 
request. 
Given the importance of enrollee 
access to medications, especially during 
a transition in coverage, or a transition 
in a level of care, we propose to codify 
this portion of our guidance and require 
provision of transition notices. 
However, in addition to this 
codification, we also propose to require 
plan sponsors to make reasonable efforts 
to notify prescribers, via mail, electronic 
or verbal communication, that the 
affected enrollees’ prescription cannot 
be refilled, either because of utilization 
management requirements such as prior 
authorization or step therapy, or 
because the prescribed medication is 
not on the plan sponsor’s formulary. We 
believe that this communication is 
necessary in order to expedite the 
prescriber’s plan to seek therapeutic 
alternatives for the enrollee or to fill out 
the requisite paper work to submit to 
the Part D sponsor to initiate the 
exceptions process. We invite comments 
on this proposal. 
Accordingly, we propose the 
following revisions to § 423.120(b)(3): 
• Add paragraph (3)(i) to clarify 
which enrollees the transition process 
should apply; 
• Add paragraph (3)(ii) to ensure 
access to a temporary supply of drugs 
within the first 90 days of coverage 
under a new plan; 
• Add paragraph (3)(iii) to provide a 
temporary fill when an enrollee requests 
a fill of a non-formulary drug during the 
time period specified in paragraph (ii) 
(including Part D drugs that are on a 
plan’s formulary but require prior 
authorization or step therapy under a 
plan’s utilization management rules) 
and the days supply in the outpatient 
setting must be for at least 30 days of 
medication. In the long-term care 
setting, the temporary supply must be 
for up to 90 days in 31 day supply 
increments; 
• Add paragraph (3)(iv) to ensure 
written notice is provided to each 
affected enrollee within 3 business days 
of the temporary fill; 
• Add paragraph (3)(v) to ensure that 
reasonable efforts are made to notify 
prescribers of affected enrollees who 
receive a transition notice under 
paragraph (iv). 
12. Part D Sponsor Responsibility for 
Retroactive Claims Adjustment 
Reimbursements and Recoveries Under 
Part D (§ 423.464) 
Sections 1860D–23 and 1860D–24 of 
the Act require PDP sponsors to 
coordinate with state pharmaceutical 
assistance programs (SPAPs) as well as 
other drug plans, including Medicaid 
programs, group health plans, Federal 
Employee Health Benefit Plans 
(FEHBP), military coverage and other 
plans or programs providing 
prescription drug coverage. These 
requirements are codified at § 423.464 
and set forth in the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. As 
we have gained more experience with 
the prescription drug program, we have 
found that some beneficiary changes (for 
example, those resulting from 
retroactive low income subsidy LIS 
eligibility determinations, LIS status 
changes, or midyear Part D enrollment 
changes) that necessitate retroactive 
claims adjustments are a significant 
issue under Part D. These changes, as 
well as long-term care pharmacy billing 
practices for dual-eligible beneficiaries 
and the presence of secondary, tertiary 
and even quartenary payers have all 
contributed to a higher than expected 
volume of retroactive claims 
adjustments requiring Part D sponsor 
reimbursements and recoveries, as well 
as a greater than anticipated complexity 
of calculating these amounts. While we 
previously anticipated that beneficiaries 
would be owed reimbursements due to 
changes in LIS status, and required plan 
sponsors to make such reimbursements 
in § 423.800(c), we have since learned 
that our current regulations do not 
reflect the other entities that may 
sometimes need to be taken into account 
in reimbursement or recovery 
transactions. Moreover, we have also 
learned that no industry standard 
electronic process exists to explicitly 
handle underpayment recoveries or 
overpayment reimbursements created by 
these adjustments, and that the current 
Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) standard 
for coordination of benefits for 
pharmacy claims only partly supports 
these activities when the pharmacy 
initiates ‘‘reverse and rebill’’ 
transactions. As a result, we are aware 
that Part D sponsors are sometimes 
struggling with how to manage these 
retroactive adjustments and that those 
sponsors that are refunding 
overpayments or seeking underpayment 
recovery are each doing it differently. 
Since current regulations do not 
address retroactive adjustments and the 
complexities associated with 
coordination of benefit activities that 
cannot be accomplished between the 
Part D sponsor and the pharmacy 
through reversal and re-billing, we have 
issued general guidance to direct 
sponsor coordination of benefit 
activities. Sections of the COB and LIS 
chapters of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual specify standards 
for a PDP sponsor to: work with other 
providers of prescription drug coverage 
to resolve payment issues; have a 
process in place to handle the payment

resolution that is not restricted by 
implementation of timely filing 
requirements; make retroactive 
adjustments and promptly refund 
monies owed to the correct party 
(including, but not limited to the 
beneficiary); and generally limit 
requests for pharmacy reprocessing to 
those situations involving a pricing 
error. Additionally, CMS guidance 
includes as part of the coordination of 
benefits the transfer of true out-of- 
pocket (TrOOP) costs and gross covered 
drug cost data to a new Part D plan 
when a beneficiary changes enrollment 
during the coverage year. In our October 
20, 2008 Part D sponsor implementation 
guidance on the automated process for 
the transfer of these TrOOP-related data, 
we established a 45-day maximum time 
limit from receipt of a post-adjudicative 
change in the reported data for the 
sponsor to take adjustment action, make 
a refund, and/or initiate recovery. We 
established this time limit after an 
informal survey and discussions with 
Part D sponsors and their processors. 
While some entities indicated they were 
making adjustments more frequently, 
the industry generally supported a 90- 
day limit, which is consistent with the 
time limit on pharmacy claim reversals. 
However, we believe this longer 
timeframe is not in the best interests of 
the beneficiary because it would delay 
the payment of refunds and notification 
of the need for payment recovery. On 
the other hand, because many of the 
claims reversals occur early in the 90- 
day period, a very short adjustment 
timeframe could lead to a series of 
consecutive refunds and recoveries that 
would be confusing and, therefore, also 
not in the best interests of the 
beneficiary. Accordingly, we believe 
that a 45-day time limit represents a 
reasonable compromise. 
Many of the post-adjudicative 
adjustments, such as those that are due 
to enrollment changes, are changes that 
affect beneficiary cost-sharing, 
premiums and/or plan benefit phase. 
Establishing a reasonable time limit for 
all Part D adjustment, refund, and 
recovery activity is in the beneficiaries’ 
best interests because it ensures that 
required changes are effectuated on 
timely basis, thus correcting retroactive 
and prospective beneficiary premium 
and cost-sharing amounts. Moreover, it 
is in the best interest of others who have 
paid a claim, or are holding a balance 
due, on the beneficiary’s behalf because 
it ensures that these amounts are 
resolved timely. 
At § 423.464 and § 423.466, we are 
proposing to codify our previous policy 
guidance (for instance, our 
memorandum on plan LIS changes 
dated October, 30, 2006) by proposing 
that sponsors must both make 
retroactive claim adjustments and take 
other payer contributions into account 
as part of the coordination of benefits. 
Further, we are also proposing to add a 
new timeliness standard at § 423.466 to 
require adjustment and issuance of 
refunds or recovery notices within 45 
days of the sponsor’s receipt of the 
information necessitating the 
adjustment. While claims adjustments 
must be made and notices issued within 
the established timeframes, we continue 
to recognize that calculating the precise 
amount of the adjustment and any 
resulting reimbursements or recoveries 
may not always be practicable due to 
limitations in the electronic transaction 
set and contractual terms and 
conditions for payment in use in the 
pharmacy industry. However, sponsors 
must exercise due diligence in fulfilling 
these requirements. 
To date, most Part D coordination of 
benefits activity has been performed at 
point-of-sale or soon after, so pharmacy 
reversal and rebilling of claims can be 
accomplished within the payers’ timely 
filing windows. For Part D, this window 
must be a minimum of 90 days, but for 
other (non-Part D) providers of 
prescription drug coverage the filing 
window could be as short as 30 days. 
With the instability of LIS data and Part 
D enrollments creating a significant 
volume of retroactive adjustments, it has 
become evident that sponsors are facing 
more claims adjustments than current 
pharmacy claim reversal and rebilling 
approaches can adequately address. 
Online real-time coordination of 
benefits, in which the order of payment 
among multiple payers is established 
and programmed into payer systems, 
generally did not take place in 
pharmacy benefit management prior to 
Part D implementation. Therefore, 
following the issuance of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit final rule on 
January 28, 2005, CMS and the industry, 
in collaboration with the National 
Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
(NCPDP), collaborated to develop an 
electronic process consistent with 
HIPAA-authorized transaction standards 
to allow supplemental payer 
information to be available at point-of- 
sale and patient-pay amounts remaining 
after supplemental payer payments to be 
reported back to the primary Part D 
sponsor for purposes of tracking TrOOP. 
However, by design, all billing 
transactions still require the pharmacy 
to initiate the activity. What this means 
in the case of a claims adjustment is that 
if the beneficiary is no longer at the 
counter and a supplemental payer’s 
claim filing window is closed, the 
pharmacy can no longer effectively 
coordinate benefits between payers. 
And payers cannot effectively 
coordinate among themselves, both 
because of the absence of electronic 
standards for post-adjudication claim 
adjustments among payers (as opposed 
to between pharmacies and payers), and 
the presence of contractual prohibitions 
between payers and pharmacies on the 
disclosure of proprietary pricing 
information. Therefore, at the present 
time, CMS and the industry are 
struggling to determine how best to 
handle retroactive claims adjustments 
whenever the adjustment cannot be 
resolved simply between the sponsor 
and the pharmacy. 
Pharmacies regard their pricing 
information as proprietary and are 
concerned about the potential chilling 
effect any disclosure of this information 
might have on their ability to negotiate 
with payers. Therefore, to ensure the 
confidentiality of pricing information, 
coordination of benefits on the initial 
claim is accomplished without reporting 
complete information on negotiated 
pricing. The amount reported in the 
transaction to the Part D plan is the 
amount of the beneficiary payment after 
the supplemental payment. As a result, 
a Part D sponsor attempting to 
determine refund or recovery amounts 
without having the pharmacy reverse 
and rebill the original claim can 
generally only impute the amount of 
any supplemental payment made by 
another payer by determining the 
difference between the Part D cost- 
sharing and the beneficiary amount paid 
after the supplemental payment. The 
only alternative is to ask the pharmacy 
to reverse and rebill the claim to all 
payers. However, this procedure is 
generally unreasonable after the 
industry standard 30-day window 
because many supplemental payers will 
not accept the late claim and, as a 
consequence, the pharmacy would be 
left short the supplemental payer 
payment amount, as well as any 
difference in beneficiary cost sharing 
that might be due. 
In the absence of legal authority to 
compel supplemental payer cooperation 
and to avoid pharmacy underpayment, 
imposing a requirement on sponsors to 
nonetheless calculate a precise 
reimbursement or recovery liability 
would require the creation of a new 
payer-to-payer transaction that both 
enables reprocessing and addresses 
pharmacies’ concerns about revealing 
their proprietary pricing. It is not clear 
that both goals can be achieved. Nor is 
it clear that even if this conflict could 
be resolved, that the cost of doing so 
would be justified by the benefits. That

is, it is not clear to us that the benefits 
of more precisely calculating the 
differential amounts owed or due (the 
incremental amounts more or less that 
supplemental payers and beneficiaries 
would have paid if the correct LIS 
subsidy had been applied to the original 
claim) outweigh the costs of developing 
customized electronic transactions for 
such calculations. This is because while 
some adjustments are from non- 
subsidized to subsidized cost sharing, 
many others only change patient pay 
amounts after the Part D plan payment 
by a dollar or two, and many would not 
change the beneficiary cost sharing at all 
because the difference would be picked 
up by or owed to a supplemental payer. 
Thus, despite the importance of 
accurate reimbursement to all parties, 
the cost of developing specialized 
transactions may outweigh the benefits 
that would accrue. 
Some supplemental payers are 
cooperating in the exploration of a 
solution through NCPDP, for example, 
certain SPAPs, but others continue to 
close their claims filing window at 30 
days and permit no further 
coordination. Part D sponsors and/or 
their claim processors are likewise 
currently engaged with CMS through 
NCPDP in examining the scope of the 
problem and exploring alternative 
approaches to retroactively and 
electronically adjust claims. However, at 
this time, while simple adjustments 
involving just the Part D sponsor and 
the pharmacy are relatively 
straightforward (and can and should be 
promptly transacted), those involving 
other payers are not. Thus, we continue 
to hold the plans accountable for 
making best efforts to coordinate 
benefits occasioned by claim 
adjustments, but we acknowledge that 
electronic transaction standards have 
not yet been developed to support 
timely, reliable, and precise 
coordination on adjusted claims when 
multiple payers are involved. Therefore, 
we will continue to work with the 
industry on methods to make best 
efforts in this area, including limiting 
other payer recoveries and 
reimbursements to imputed amounts 
due to and from supplemental payers 
that choose to fully cooperate with 
industry consensus-driven processes 
developed through NCPDP. We note 
that amounts due to or from 
beneficiaries must also be imputed in 
some of these situations. We are 
soliciting comments on alternative 
approaches to improving post- 
adjudication coordination of benefits 
necessitated by retroactive Medicare 
enrollment and low-income subsidy 
changes when multiple payers are 
involved, as well as our assessment that 
the costs of achieving precision in such 
transactions may far outweigh the 
benefits. 
In the short-term, there are some 
adjustment-related activities that plans 
can control and, consistent with our 
authority in section 1860D–24(a)(1) of 
the Act, we can require that sponsors do 
these better. Therefore, we are 
proposing the following revisions to 
§ 423.464: 
• Revising paragraph (a) to clarify 
that all Part D sponsors must comply 
with administrative processes and 
requirements established by CMS to 
ensure effective coordination between 
Part D plans and other providers of 
prescription drug coverage for 
retroactive claims adjustments, 
underpayment reimbursements and 
overpayment recoveries; and 
• Adding a paragraph (g)(7) to 
address the sponsors’ responsibility to 
account for payments by SPAPs and 
other providers of prescription drug 
coverage in reconciling retroactive 
claims adjustments that create 
overpayments and/or underpayments, 
as well as to account for payments 
made, and for amounts being held for 
payment, by other individuals or 
entities. The new paragraph also 
specifies that Part D sponsors must have 
systems to track and report adjustment 
transactions and to demonstrate that— 
++ Adjustments involving payments 
by other plans and programs providing 
prescription drug coverage have been 
made; 
++ Reimbursements for excess cost- 
sharing and premiums for low-income 
subsidy eligible individuals have been 
processed in accordance with the 
requirements in § 423.800(c); and 
++ Recoveries of erroneous payments 
for enrollees have been sought as 
specified in § 423.464(f)(4). 
13. Time Limits for Coordination of 
Benefits (§ 423.466) 
Currently, there is no statutory or 
regulatory time limit for Part D sponsor 
coordination of benefits with SPAPs, 
other providers of prescription drug 
coverage, or other payers. Current CMS 
guidance as set forth in the 
Coordination of Benefits (COB) chapter 
of the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Benefit Manual requires Part D sponsors 
to establish at least a 90-day timely 
claims filing window and to make 
appropriate allowances for COB claims 
on a case-by-case basis. Section 50 of 
the COB chapter also requires sponsors, 
in retroactive enrollment situations, to 
coordinate benefits with other payers as 
required by the regulations at 
§ 423.464(f), as well as accept claims 
from the beneficiary without imposing 
time limits. This section states further 
that sponsors, even in those situations 
when retroactive enrollment is not an 
issue, continue to be liable for claims 
received after the end of the coverage 
year as defined in § 423.308 and note 
that while contract provisions regarding 
timely claims filing may limit claims 
from network pharmacies, nonnetwork 
pharmacies and beneficiaries must still 
have the opportunity to submit claims 
for reimbursement without the 
imposition of time limits by the Part D 
sponsor. 
Experience with Part D has shown 
there is benefit to be derived from 
placing a time limit on claims 
submission for Part D sponsor 
coordination of benefits. In addition to 
limiting sponsors’ financial liability, a 
time limit would strengthen the ability 
of SPAPs, other providers of 
prescription drug coverage and other 
payers, including beneficiaries to obtain 
payment for covered Part D drugs. We 
would likewise benefit from a COB time 
limit by enabling us to close our Part D 
prescription drug databases. 
In considering now establishing time 
limits on the submission of claims to 
Part D sponsors by beneficiaries and 
other payers of prescription drug 
coverage for proper coordination of 
benefits, we note that the Medicare FFS 
time limit for filing claims, as specified 
in § 424.44, is December 31st of the 
following year for services furnished 
during the first 9 months of a calendar 
year and December 31st of the second 
following year for services furnished 
during the last 3 months of the calendar 
year. The time for filing will be 
extended 6 months if the failure to file 
timely is due to an error or 
misrepresentation by an employee, 
intermediary, carrier, or agent of the 
Department. We also noted that States 
have a 3-year time limit for seeking 
recovery of Medicaid claims payments 
when the State is not the primary payer. 
Specifically, the Deficit Reduction Act 
of 2005 (Pub. L. 109–171) (DRA) 
strengthened the State Medicaid 
programs’ ability to obtain payment 
from health insurers with which they 
need to coordinate benefits by adding 
section 1902(a)(25)(I) of the Act. The 
new section requires States to have laws 
in effect that require health insurers to 
make payment as long as the claim is 
submitted by the State within 3 years 
from the date on which the item or 
service was furnished. This DRA 
provision does not include SPAPs and, 
therefore, does not impose a time limit 
on the requirement for Part D sponsors 
to coordinate benefits with SPAPs.

54665 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Having considered these filing limit 
precedents, we now propose to establish 
a 3-year filing limit for Part D 
coordination of benefits with SPAPs, 
other entities providing prescription 
drug coverage, and all other payers, 
including beneficiaries or other 
individuals or entities paying, or 
holding amounts for payment, on the 
beneficiaries’ behalf. Specifically, we 
propose to revise new § 423.466 by 
adding a new paragraph (b) that would 
establish a 3-year time limit on Part D 
coordination of benefits. That is, we 
propose to require Part D sponsors to 
coordinate benefits with SPAPs, other 
entities providing prescription drug 
coverage, and other payers for a period 
not to exceed 3 years from the date on 
which the prescription for the covered 
Part D drug was filled. By adding this 
provision to the regulation, we clarify 
timely filing responsibilities and 
deadlines for all beneficiaries and 
payers, as well as place a limit on Part 
D sponsors’ claims payment liabilities 
and coordination of benefits 
responsibilities. 
We are proposing this requirement 
consistent with our authority under 
sections 1860D–23(a)(2) and 1860D– 
24(a)(1) of the Act to establish 
requirements to ensure effective 
coordination among Part D plans, 
SPAPs, and other providers of 
prescription drug coverage, and 
consistent with our general rulemaking 
authority under section 1871(a) of the 
Act. Experience since the 
implementation of Part D has 
demonstrated that the ability of both 
CMS and the sponsors to manage our 
respective responsibilities in 
administering the program is 
complicated by the absence of any time 
limit for coordination of benefits. Part D 
sponsors face open-ended financial 
liability for continued benefit 
coordination and must project and 
include the costs of future liabilities in 
their bids. We also incur the expense of 
keeping our databases open to continue 
to accept prescription drug event data 
for the purpose of reopening Part D 
payment determinations to account for 
claims received by Part D sponsors from 
SPAPs, other entities providing 
prescription drug coverage, and other 
payers after the end of the coverage 
year. We believe that a 3-year limit 
provides more than ample time for 
beneficiaries to seek reimbursement of 
out-of-network and other paper claims, 
as well as sufficient time for 
coordination of benefits activities to 
take place among payers. 
14. Use of Standardized Technology 
Under Part D (§ 423.120) 
Section 1860D–4(b)(2)(A) of the Act, 
as codified in § 423.120(c), requires Part 
D sponsors to issue (and reissue, as 
appropriate) a card or other technology 
that may be used by an enrollee to 
assure access to negotiated prices under 
section 1860D–2(d) of the Act. Section 
1860D–4(b)(2)(B) of the Act requires us 
to provide for the development, 
adoption, or recognition of standards 
relating to a standardized format for the 
card or other technology that are 
compatible with the administrative 
simplification requirements of Title XI 
of the Act and to consult with the 
NCPDP and other standard setting 
organizations, as appropriate. In 
accordance with section 1860D– 
4(b)(2)(B) of the Act, we consulted with 
NCPDP and subsequently issued 
guidance adopting NCPDP’s ‘‘Pharmacy 
ID Card Standard’’, which is based on 
the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) INCITS 284–1997 
standard entitled ‘‘Identification Card- 
Health Care Identification Cards’’, as the 
standard for identification cards for the 
Part D program. Information required in 
the Pharmacy ID Card Standard 
includes billing identifiers necessary to 
direct online real-time transactions to 
the appropriate online processor to 
enable real-time adjudication of the 
prescription drug claim at point of sale. 
Our current regulations and guidance 
specifically address the requirement for 
Part D sponsors to issue (and reissue, as 
appropriate) standardized cards that 
may be used by an enrollee to ensure 
access to negotiated prices under 
section 1860D–2(d) of the Act. The only 
way that an enrollee can be assured 
access to the negotiated price at the 
point of sale is through online 
adjudication of the prescription drug 
claim. Any other price available to the 
beneficiary at the point of sale, as for 
instance, the pharmacy’s ‘‘cash price’’, 
cannot be deemed to be the negotiated 
price mandated under section 1860D– 
2(d) of the Act. Therefore, to ensure 
access to these negotiated prices, the 
billing information on the cards must be 
used by the pharmacies at which 
beneficiaries fill their prescriptions to 
submit claims to an enrollee’s Part D 
sponsor (or its intermediary). Beginning 
with the COB requirements originally 
issued on July 1, 2005, as required by 
section 1863D–23(a)(1) of the Act, and 
subsequently maintained as Chapter 14 
of the Prescription Drug Plan Manual, 
we have instructed plan sponsors to 
process all claims online real-time (see 
section 50.4 entitled, ‘‘Processing 
Claims and Tracking TrOOP’’. The 
requirements of accurate TrOOP 
accumulations, Part D benefit 
administration of multiple coverage 
intervals, and coordination of benefits 
with other payers all necessitate online 
real-time adjudication of individual 
pharmacy claims. Furthermore, since 
July 1, 2005, we have stated that we 
expect that Part D plan sponsors will 
establish policies and procedures 
appropriately restricting the use of 
paper claims to those situations in 
which on-line claims processing is not 
available to the beneficiary at the point 
of sale in order to promote accurate 
TrOOP accounting, as well as to 
minimize administrative costs to the 
Part D plans and the Medicare program 
and reduce opportunities for fraudulent 
duplicative claim reimbursements. We 
are now proposing at section 
423.120(c)(3) to require Part D sponsors 
to contractually mandate that their 
network pharmacies submit claims 
electronically to the Part D sponsor or 
its intermediary on behalf of the 
beneficiary whenever feasible unless the 
enrollee expressly requests that a 
particular claim not be submitted to the 
Part D sponsor or its intermediary. 
We are proposing to codify this 
guidance in regulation at this time 
because we have been made aware of an 
increasing number of instances in which 
network pharmacies are not submitting 
pharmacy claims to Part D Sponsors on 
behalf of Part D enrollees. Generally, we 
believe it is in the best interest of Part 
D enrollees to have their claims 
consistently processed through the Part 
D sponsor (or its intermediary). Not only 
does processing claims through the Part 
D sponsor ensure access to Part D 
negotiated prices, but it also ensures 
that proper concurrent drug utilization 
review (including safety checks) is 
performed (as required under 1860D– 
4(c) of the Act). Only the plan can 
conduct accurate concurrent drug 
utilization review when multiple 
pharmacies are utilized by the 
beneficiary or prevent payment to 
excluded providers. Online, real-time 
processing also facilitates accurate 
accounting for enrollees’ true out-of- 
pocket (TrOOP) and total drug costs by 
the Part D sponsor so that each claim is 
processed in the appropriate phase of 
the benefit and accurate cost sharing 
assessed. In addition, a Part D sponsor 
cannot coordinate benefits with other 
payers as required under sections 
1860D–23 and 1860D–24 of the Act if it 
never receives the claim. 
We also propose to add a new 
paragraph (2) to § 423.120(c) to codify 
our existing guidance that Part D 
sponsors utilize standard electronic 
transactions established by 45 CFR

54666 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
162.1102 for processing Part D claims. 
We will issue guidance on the use of 
optional or conditional fields in the 
HIPAA standard transactions through 
the Call Letter and Prescription Drug 
Benefit Manual instructions. We 
routinely work with NCPDP and 
industry representatives in arriving at 
recommendations for standardized use 
of such fields when necessary to 
improve administration of the Part D 
benefit. Previous examples of such 
guidance include those described in 
sections 50.4 and 50.5 of Chapter 14 of 
the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual on 
‘‘Processing Claims and Tracking 
TrOOP’’ and ‘‘Standardized Claims 
Messaging’’, respectively. Such 
instructions are consistent with the 
rules governing use of HIPAA 
transactions whereby use of optional 
and conditional fields is governed by 
contractual terms between trading 
partners. 
In a related matter, we are interested 
in better understanding the impact of a 
requirement for Part D sponsors to 
establish uniquely identifiable Part D 
payer/processor and enrollee 
identification numbers in billing and 
other coordination of benefits-related 
transactions. We have learned that not 
all processors organize their enrollment 
data this way, and some may rely upon 
other data such as person codes or dates 
of birth to distinguish between two 
enrollees (such as spouses) with a single 
identification number (‘‘RxID’’). This 
practice complicates coordination of 
benefits activities with other parties 
when unique identifiers are necessary. 
We have also learned that pharmacies 
cannot routinely distinguish Medicare 
Part D claims from other types of 
prescription drug coverage when the 
same routing information (‘‘RxBIN and 
RxPCN’’) is used for all lines of business 
managed by a single processor. If 
pharmacies cannot consistently 
distinguish Part D claims, they cannot 
ensure that Part D claims and 
beneficiaries are handled in accordance 
with Part D-specific policies and 
procedures. Consequently we are 
proposing to add a new paragraph (c)(4) 
in § 423.120 to require that sponsors and 
their intermediary processors establish 
and exclusively utilize unique RxBIN or 
‘‘RxBIN/RxPCN combinations’’ to 
identify all Medicare part D member 
claims, as well as to assign unique 
‘‘RxID’’ identifiers to individual Part D 
beneficiaries. We solicit comments on 
the operational issues and timelines that 
would be involved in making these 
proposed technical changes to claims 
processing systems. 
As stated previously, we generally 
believe it is in the best interest of Part 
D enrollees to have their claims 
electronically submitted at the point of 
sale by pharmacies to the Part D sponsor 
(or its intermediary), but recognize there 
are situations when this will not be 
feasible or warranted. The most obvious 
example involves prescriptions filled at 
out-of-network pharmacies when Part D 
enrollees generally must pay out of 
pocket and submit paper claims for 
reimbursement from the Part D sponsor. 
Another example involves situations 
when network pharmacies offer special 
discount prices that are lower than plan 
negotiated prices. If this discounted 
price is not a pharmacy’s usual and 
customary (U&C) price, we understand 
that the pharmacy may not offer it to the 
Part D sponsor (or its intermediary) for 
claims processing. In these situations, 
we have articulated a ‘‘lower cash 
price’’ policy whereby the enrollee may 
pay the pharmacy in full and submit a 
paper claim for reimbursement so that 
the costs will be counted towards his or 
her total drug spend and TrOOP 
balances. Finally, we also recognize that 
enrollees may have personal reasons for 
not wanting specific prescription claims 
processed through their Part D sponsor 
(or intermediary) and we uphold the 
enrollees’ right to make such decisions. 
In situations such as the last two 
examples, our proposed requirement 
now clarifies that the enrollee must 
expressly request that a particular claim 
not be submitted to the Part D sponsor 
or its intermediary for processing. That 
is, the beneficiary should of his or her 
own initiative request that the claim not 
be submitted to the Part D plan, and this 
decision must neither be solicited nor 
assumed by the pharmacy. 
While the previous examples explain 
why some pharmacy claims for Part D 
enrollees legitimately will not be 
processed through the Part D sponsor 
(or its intermediary), we are concerned 
about other reasons why network 
pharmacies may be failing to submit 
claims to Part D sponsors (or their 
intermediaries). Most notably, we are 
concerned that enrollees, their 
pharmacists or both incorrectly believe 
that the enrollee will always pay their 
Part D sponsor’s higher negotiated price 
in situations when the pharmacy has a 
lower price. In many cases, this is 
illustrated by the enrollee submitting a 
paper claim after having paid cash at a 
network pharmacy even though the 
enrollee would have received the same 
price if the claim was processed through 
the Part D sponsor (or its intermediary) 
by the network pharmacy. We believe 
there may be confusion resulting from 
the increasing availability of very low 
cost generic drugs at many Part D 
network pharmacies. 
It is important to distinguish between 
a lower pharmacy price that is the 
pharmacy’s U&C price versus a lower 
pharmacy price that is a non-U&C 
special discounted price. As our ‘‘lower 
cash price’’ policy describes, an enrollee 
would need to pay out of pocket and 
submit for reimbursement if the 
pharmacy’s lower price is not its U&C 
price because the pharmacy will not 
submit that price to the Part D sponsor 
(or its intermediary). However, if the 
pharmacy submits a U&C price that is 
lower than a Part D sponsor’ negotiated 
price, the enrollee will pay the lesser of 
the Part D sponsor’s negotiated price or 
the pharmacy’s U&C price. Therefore, 
the enrollee is better off when the 
pharmacy submits the claim to the Part 
D sponsor (or its intermediary) because 
the enrollee will pay the lower 
pharmacy price and have the dollar 
amounts reflected in their TrOOP and 
total drug spend balances. 
Finally, we are concerned that 
sometimes enrollees are not aware that 
claims are not being processed through 
their Part D sponsor. We believe this can 
occur when pharmacies mistakenly 
believe that processing the claim 
through the Part D sponsor will result in 
the enrollee paying a higher Part D 
sponsor negotiated price or because the 
pharmacy deliberately does not want to 
incur transaction costs when the 
enrollee will be paying the pharmacy 
U&C price regardless. Our new 
requirement makes it clear that Part D 
sponsors must contractually require 
their network pharmacies to submit 
claims to the Part D sponsor (or its 
intermediary) whenever feasible unless 
the enrollee expressly requests that such 
claims not be submitted. We believe this 
requirement will help to ensure that 
Part D enrollees always have access to 
critical safety checks, as well as Part D 
negotiated prices and that their TrOOP 
and total drug spend balances 
accurately reflect their Part D 
expenditures. 
15. Absence From Service Area for More 
Than 12 Months Under Part D (§ 423.44) 
Section 1860D–1 of the Act 
establishes eligibility criteria for 
enrolling in a PDP plan or an MA–PD 
plan. In accordance with section 
1860D–1(a)(3) of the Act, a ‘‘Part D 
eligible individual’’ is defined as an 
individual who is entitled to or enrolled 
in Medicare benefits under Part A or 
enrolled in Part B. In order to enroll in 
a PDP, the individual must reside in the 
plan’s service area, and cannot be 
enrolled in an MA plan, other than an 
MSA plan or PFFS plan that does not

54667 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
provide qualified prescription drug 
coverage. 
Section 1860D–1(b)(1)(B) of the Act 
generally directs us to use disenrollment 
rules similar to those established under 
section 1851 of the Act. We applied the 
provisions of section 1851(g)(3) of the 
Act that provide authority for the basis 
of terminations for MA plans, which are 
codified in § 422.74. The disenrollment 
provisions for PDPs are outlined in 
§ 423.44. 
Under the current MA and PDP rules 
at § 422.74 and § 423.44, respectively, 
individuals who are out of the service 
area for more than 6 months will be 
disenrolled. There is an exception for 
MA plans that offer visitor or traveler 
benefits which allows a temporary 
absence from the service area for up to 
12 months. However, given the inherent 
difference between PDPs and MA plans 
(in particular, the range of services each 
provides) we believe that it may not be 
appropriate or necessary to apply the 
disenrollment requirements established 
under MA in the same way for PDPs. 
The 6-month limit on the length of time 
an MA enrollee may be out of the 
service area before being disenrolled is 
based in large part on the inability of the 
enrollee to access the full range of 
medical services while out of the plan 
service area. However, Part D benefits 
generally can be accessed through a 
national pharmacy network, which can 
serve individuals effectively regardless 
of whether they are in their PDP region 
of residence. Thus, the same out-of-area 
time limit for PDPs may not be 
necessary, as long as there are specific 
assurances from the PDP that 
individuals will have access to PDP 
benefits while out of the area (provided 
the individual remains in the United 
States). For example, a PDP may have 
shared computer systems with PDPs in 
other regions or have a network of 
pharmacies in other regions (or 
nationwide) that would provide 
immediate access to prescription drugs 
outside of the region on the same basis 
as pharmacies within the enrollee’s 
region of residence. 
Therefore, given the nature of the Part 
D benefit and the strong likelihood that 
a PDP enrollee can access the full range 
of PDP benefits while out of the service 
area, we are proposing to amend 
§ 423.44 to allow a temporary absence 
from the PDP plan service area for up to 
12 months before disenrollment would 
be mandatory. We believe 12 months is 
an appropriate time frame because it is 
consistent with the time frame for MA 
plans’ visitor or traveler benefits. 
16. Prohibition of Mid-Year Mass 
Enrollment Changes by SPAPS Under 
Part D (§ 423.464(e) 
Section 1860D–23(b) of the Act 
defines a SPAP as a State program that 
(1) provides financial assistance for the 
purchase or provision of supplemental 
prescription drug coverage or benefits 
on behalf of part D eligible individuals; 
(2) when determining eligibility and the 
amount of assistance to Part D eligible 
individuals under the Part D program, 
provides assistance to such individuals 
in all Part D plans and does not 
discriminate based upon the Part D plan 
in which the individual is enrolled; and 
(3) satisfies the requirements of other 
provisions in section 1860D–23 of the 
Act, like Medicare as primary payer. 
Section 1860D–23(a)(1) of the Act 
provides that the Secretary has the 
authority to establish requirements for 
Part D sponsors to ensure the effective 
coordination between a Part D plan and 
an SPAP. Included among those 
requirements are enrollment file 
sharing, claims processing and payment, 
claims reconciliation, application of the 
out-of-pocket expenditures, and other 
administrative processes set by the 
Secretary. In order to coordinate 
effectively with Part D sponsors, we 
permit SPAPs to conduct large volumes 
of enrollments (sometimes referred to as 
‘‘mass enrollments’’) consistent with our 
nondiscrimination guidance (see 
Chapter 14 of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Program Manual). Most 
SPAPs perform these mass enrollments 
on a calendar year basis for all its 
members who have not chosen a Part D 
plan; however, some SPAPs have 
chosen to perform these enrollments on 
a noncalendar year basis. In these 
situations, Part D sponsors have found 
that substantial disenrollment of large 
numbers of SPAP members from one 
plan, followed by mass enrollment into 
another during the calendar year 
significantly affects their financial 
operations. 
We believe that mass re-enrollment 
into a new plan mid-year disrupts any 
continuity of care the beneficiary has 
established with his other current Part 
D plan, and introduces transition risks 
such as drugs not being covered by the 
member’s new plan, or requiring the 
member to change his or her pharmacy 
that are not outweighed by any 
administrative convenience to the 
SPAP. Therefore, given these concerns, 
we are proposing, under our authority 
described above, to add a requirement to 
§ 423.464(e) to prohibit mid-year mass 
enrollment changes by SPAPs. We 
believe this revision would deter any 
SPAPs from engaging in what has been 
a rare but exceedingly disruptive 
practice, and require large enrollment 
changes to be made on a calendar year 
basis only. We note that individual 
members of qualified SPAPs (or the 
State acting as the authorized 
representative of individual members) 
will continue to have Special 
Enrollment Periods (SEP), as provided 
in the current CMS guidance, for case- 
by-case enrollment actions. 
In addition to beneficiary disruptions, 
our actuaries have determined that there 
are significant financial disparities 
among the Part D plans related to mass 
mid-year plan enrollment changes. The 
source of the disparity is the front- 
loading of plan liabilities in the annual 
bid due to the unique benefit structure 
of Part D program, including the 
coverage gap. Specifically, plans that 
have beneficiaries early in the year are 
likely to incur expenses attributable to 
the initial coverage period, the portion 
of the benefit that includes 75 percent 
coverage. Plans that have beneficiaries 
later in the year are more likely to have 
beneficiaries during the coverage gap 
portion of the benefit, which requires 
100 percent beneficiary cost-sharing and 
no plan payment obligation in most 
cases. Because the funding of the benefit 
is uniform over the entire plan year, 
plans that lose beneficiaries mid-year 
are more likely to incur losses (the 
premiums associated with these 
beneficiaries after the initial coverage 
period), and plans that acquire 
beneficiaries mid-year from other Part D 
plans are more likely to experience 
gains (due to the beneficiaries enrolling 
during the gap in coverage) that in 
neither case have been anticipated in 
the plan’s bids. This inequitable result 
demonstrates the importance of having 
a policy in place that minimizes mass 
mid-year plan changes. 
17. Nonrenewal Beneficiary Notification 
Requirement Under Parts C and D 
(§ 422.506, and § 423.507) 
Section 1857(a) of the Act provides 
the Secretary with the authority to enter 
into contracts with MA organizations, 
and section 1860D–12(b)(1) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
authority to enter into contracts with 
PDP sponsors. Additionally, sections 
1857(c)(1) and 1860D–12(b)(3)(B) of the 
Act grant the Secretary the authority to 
renew contracts. In accordance with the 
above-referenced authority, we have 
issued contracting regulations including 
§ 422.506 of the MA regulations, and 
§ 423.507 of the Part D regulations 
which provide for the nonrenewal of a 
contract. 
Nonrenewals of MA or PDP contracts 
require the MA organization, the Part D

sponsor, or CMS to notify both the 
enrollees of the organization or sponsor 
and the general public of the 
nonrenewal. Existing regulations require 
notification 60 days prior to the 
effective date of the nonrenewal for 
notification both to enrollees and to the 
general public. The effective date of 
contract nonrenewals in the MA and 
PDP programs is January 1st of each 
calendar year. We propose to change the 
requirement for notification to enrollees 
from an ‘‘at least 60 day requirement’’ 
to an ‘‘at least 90 day requirement’’, as 
it was prior to January 1, 2009. 
Changing the requirement for the 
personalized beneficiary specific CMS- 
approved notice to at least 90 days 
provides beneficiaries with an increased 
notice period giving beneficiaries more 
time to choose a new Medicare plan 
prior to the start of the new benefit year. 
When we changed the required notice 
period to 60 days, we did so primarily 
to provide adequate time for the appeals 
process to conclude prior to the start of 
the next calendar year; however, our 
recent experience has indicated that the 
vast number of nonrenewals are 
voluntarily elected by the PDP sponsor 
or MA organization, so there is rarely a 
need to accommodate the appeals 
process. For this reason, we propose 
revising § 422.506(a)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii) 
of the MA regulations and 
§ 423.507(a)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of the 
Part D regulations to change the 
beneficiary notice requirement from at 
least 60 days to at least 90 days. 
We also propose removing the current 
requirement for nonrenewing plans (in 
voluntary nonrenewal situations) and 
for us (in CMS-initiated nonrenewal 
situations) to provide notice to the 
general public by publishing a notice in 
one or more newspapers of general 
circulation concerning the impending 
nonrenewal. This change is motivated 
by the cost of newspaper advertisements 
and the declining rate of newspaper 
circulation, weighed against the very 
limited benefit gained from notice to the 
general public who is minimally, if at 
all, affected by the nonrenewal. Also, 
non-renewal information is now easily 
available to the general public through 
Internet web sites maintained by us (for 
example, http://www.Medicare.gov), a 
resource not available to the public 
when the newspaper notice requirement 
was first adopted. We believe that the 
requirement to provide personalized 
nonrenewal information to plan 
enrollees is sufficient to ensure 
adequate nonrenewal notice to the 
beneficiaries that are being nonrenewed, 
the population that is most directly 
affected by the nonrenewal. For this 
reason, we propose deleting 
§ 422.506(a)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iii) of the 
MA regulations and § 423.507(a)(2)(iii) 
and (b)(2)(iii) of the Part D regulations 
to remove the requirement that the 
general public be informed of the 
impending nonrenewal through the 
publication of newspaper notices. 
18. Notice of Alternative Medicare Plans 
Available To Replace Nonrenewing 
Plans Under Parts C and D 
(§ 422.506(a)(2)(ii) and 
§ 423.507(a)(2)(ii)) 
To allow additional operational 
flexibility, we also propose to change 
the requirement for PDP sponsors and 
MA organizations to provide written 
notification of the alternative Medicare 
plans available to replace the 
nonrenewing plan. We propose 
changing the requirement to include the 
option of either providing a written list 
of alternatives available, or placing 
outbound calls to all affected enrollees 
to ensure beneficiaries know whom to 
contact to learn about their enrollment 
options. We believe this change will be 
advantageous for beneficiaries because, 
depending on where the beneficiary 
resides, a listing of available plan 
options is often very long and may be 
too overwhelming for the beneficiary to 
use appropriately. A much more useful 
approach would be to provide 
beneficiaries with contact information 
and resources for identifying the most 
appropriate option given their unique, 
individual circumstances. For this 
reason, we propose revising 
§ 422.506(a)(2)(ii) of the MA regulations 
and § 423.507(a)(2)(ii) of the Part D 
regulations, to provide the option of 
sending written notices of all available 
alternatives or placing outbound 
beneficiary calls to ensure beneficiaries 
know whom to contact to learn about 
their enrollment options. In either case, 
as discussed earlier in this section, a 
personalized CMS-approved beneficiary 
notice regarding the nonrenewal still 
must be sent to each beneficiary. 
19. Timeframes and Responsibility for 
Making Redeterminations Under Part D 
(§ 423.590) 
In accordance with section 1860D– 
4(g) of the Act, the Part D 
redetermination notice provisions in 
§ 423.590 largely mirror the MA 
reconsideration notice provisions in 
§ 422.590. There is one notable 
exception—§ 422.590(d)(3) allows MA 
plans to make the initial notice of a 
completely favorable expedited 
reconsideration orally, so long as a 
written confirmation is mailed to the 
enrollee within 3 calendar days of the 
oral notice. We did not carry over this 
requirement to § 423.590, although a 
parallel instruction is contained in our 
subregulatory guidance in Chapter 18 of 
the PDP manual. Therefore, we propose 
to reconcile this discrepancy by adding 
new § 423.590(d)(2). Consistent with the 
requirements in § 422.590(d)(3), new 
§ 423.590(d)(2) will allow Part D plan 
sponsors to make the initial notice of a 
completely favorable expedited 
redetermination orally, so long as a 
written confirmation of the fully 
favorable decision is mailed to the 
enrollee within three calendar days of 
the oral notice. 
We also propose in § 423.590(d)(2) to 
allow Part D plan sponsors to make the 
initial notice of an adverse expedited 
reconsideration orally, so long as a 
written confirmation of the decision is 
mailed to the enrollee within three 
calendar days of the oral notice. We also 
propose to add a cross reference to 
paragraphs § 422.590(d)(1) and (d)(2) in 
paragraph (g) in order to apply the 
written notice requirements in 
paragraph (g) to adverse expedited 
redetermination decisions. We 
recognize that the MA reconsideration 
notice provisions at § 422.590(d)(5) and 
(e) do not provide explicit instructions 
regarding how MA organizations are to 
notify MA enrollees of adverse 
expedited reconsideration decisions. 
However, given the expedited status of 
these requests, we believe adding these 
two proposed notice requirements to the 
Part D expedited redetermination 
process is in the enrollee’s best 
interests. Additionally, because adverse 
redetermination decisions are not 
automatically forwarded to the Part D 
Independent Review Entity, Part D 
enrollees need to receive clear 
information about the right to appeal 
and the procedures for appealing. We 
note that these two proposals are 
consistent with our subregulatory 
guidance and the process for notifying 
enrollees of expedited adverse coverage 
determination decisions in § 423.572(b). 
Similarly, § 423.590(a)(1) requires a 
plan sponsor to send an enrollee written 
notice of a completely favorable 
decision for benefits; however, the 
regulations do not specify the content of 
that notice. Consistent with the statute, 
§ 423.590(a)(1) mirrors the parallel 
provision at § 422.590(a)(1). However, 
for the same reasons outlined in the 
discussion above in this section, we 
believe incorporating notice 
requirements for the Part D standard 
reconsideration notice provisions does 
not conflict with the related MA 
provisions, and will provide an 
important beneficiary protection that 
will ensure continuity of care for 
Medicare beneficiaries who are

obtaining refills of prescription drugs 
under Part D. Therefore, we propose to 
add § 423.590(h) to establish the form 
and content requirements for 
completely favorable redetermination 
decisions, and propose making those 
notice requirements applicable to 
redeterminations issued under 
paragraph (a)(1). We also propose to 
reference paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) in 
paragraph (h), so the proposed form and 
notice requirements in paragraph (h) 
will apply to completely favorable 
expedited redetermination decisions. 
20. Requirements for Requesting 
Organization Determinations Under Part 
C (§ 422.568) 
Section 1852(g)(3) of the Act allows 
an enrollee to request an expedited 
organization determination either orally 
or in writing. However, the method for 
requesting a standard determination is 
not addressed in either the Act or the 
implementing regulations at § 422.568. 
Both beneficiary advocates and MA 
plans have voiced concern about the 
absence of express regulatory authority 
allowing enrollees to request standard 
organization determinations both orally 
and in writing. Therefore, we propose 
adding specific language in § 422.568 
allowing oral requests for organization 
determinations, except where the 
request is for payment. 
21. Organization Determinations Under 
Part C (§ 422.566 and § 422.568) 
Section 1852(g)(1)(A) of the Act 
requires MA organizations to have a 
procedure for making determinations 
regarding whether an enrollee is entitled 
to receive health services or payment 
under the program. In accordance with 
section 1852(g)(1)(A) of the Act, 
§ 422.566 and § 422.568 establish the 
requirements related to organization 
determinations and notices. Existing 
§ 422.566(b)(4) specifies that an 
organization determination includes a 
determination resulting in 
‘‘[d]iscontinuation or reduction of a 
service if the enrollee believes that 
continuation of the services is medically 
necessary.’’ (emphasis added). 
Similarly, under § 422.568(c), the plan 
must give the enrollee a written notice 
of the determination ‘‘if an enrollee 
disagrees with the MA organization’s 
decision to discontinue or reduce an 
ongoing course of treatment.’’ (emphasis 
added). 
Both of these provisions have at times 
been read to imply that the existence of 
an organization determination, and the 
associated notice requirements, were 
tied to the enrollee’s ‘‘belief’’ or 
‘‘disagreement.’’ Therefore, we propose 
changing this language to better reflect 
its meaning and purpose by removing 
the phrases ‘‘if the enrollee believes that 
continuation of the services is medically 
necessary’’ and ‘‘if an enrollee disagrees 
with an MA organization’s decision to’’. 
Regardless of an enrollee’s decision 
whether to appeal as a result of this 
discontinuation or reduction, the key 
purpose of these provisions was to 
ensure that enrollees received an 
explanation of the plan’s decision and 
their rights if they choose to appeal the 
determination. Therefore, we propose 
removing the language noted above from 
§ 422.566(b)(4) and § 422.568(c). 
22. Representatives (§ 422.561, 
§ 422.574, and § 422.624) 
For various reasons, enrollees may 
choose or need to have someone 
represent them in the appeals process in 
order to protect their interests. 
Presently, under sections 1852(f) and (g) 
of the Act, a representative may act on 
behalf of an enrollee or other party 
when filing a grievance. However, 
existing § 422.561 does not explicitly 
permit the filing of grievances by 
representatives unlike the 
corresponding Part D regulation. In 
order to rectify this and be consistent 
with the Part D definition of 
representative at § 423.560, we propose 
to amend § 422.561 to clarify that a 
representative may act on an enrollee’s 
behalf with respect to the grievance 
process. 
23. Disclosure Requirements Under 
Parts C and D (§ 422.111(g) and 
§ 423.128(f)) 
Section 1857(a) of the Act provides 
the Secretary with the authority to enter 
into contracts with MA organizations, 
and section 1860D–12(b)(1) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
authority to enter into contracts with 
PDP sponsors. Currently, § 422.111 and 
§ 423.128 provide specific requirements 
on information that must be disclosed to 
enrollees, either at specific designated 
times, or upon request. We are 
proposing at § 422.111(g) and 
§ 423.128(f) to state that we may require 
a sponsoring organization to disclose to 
its enrollees and potential enrollees 
information concerning the sponsoring 
organization’s performance and contract 
compliance deficiencies in a manner 
specified by CMS. This disclosure may 
be required when a sponsoring 
organization is sanctioned, or when a 
sponsoring organization’s compliance 
and/or performance deficiencies rise to 
a certain level, such that we determine 
it is necessary for the sponsoring 
organization to notify its existing and 
potential enrollees of these deficiencies. 
The vehicle by which the information is 
disclosed by the plan, such as through 
the organization’s Web site, pre- 
enrollment materials, or separate letter 
to enrollees, and the timing and content 
of that disclosure, are subject to CMS 
review and approval. The language we 
are proposing is not intended to limit 
these required disclosures to particular 
times of the year when beneficiaries 
would ordinarily be able to make 
changes or elections (for example, AEP 
or OEP). We believe that this kind of 
transparency will provide additional 
incentives for sponsoring organizations 
to make improvements to their 
operations and also provide relevant 
information to beneficiaries and the 
public concerning plan choices. We 
solicit comment on these regulatory 
provisions. In particular, we solicit 
comment on whether these disclosure 
requirements should be imposed only in 
those circumstances where a beneficiary 
would be afforded the opportunity to act 
on them (for example, requiring 
disclosure during the particular times of 
year when beneficiaries would 
ordinarily be able to make change or 
elections, except in those situations 
where the compliance deficiency is so 
significant that a beneficiary may be 
afforded a special enrollment 
opportunity). 
24. Definition of MA Plan Service Area 
(§ 422.2) 
Section 1851(b)(1)(A) of the Act 
provides that Medicare beneficiaries are 
eligible to enroll in an MA plan only if 
they reside in the geographic area 
served by the MA plan, that is, the 
‘‘service area.’’ An MA plan’s ‘‘service 
area’’ is currently defined in § 422.2 and 
the definition expressly requires 
organizations to meet access standards, 
in accordance with access standards in 
§ 422.112. 
One question that has been posed to 
us is whether incarcerated individuals 
are eligible to join an MA plan, 
especially an MA plan that does not 
offer Medicare prescription drug 
coverage. Note that the definition of 
service area for a Part D plan (§ 423.4) 
already excludes a jail or prison within 
the boundaries of the Part D plan service 
area, given that beneficiaries in jail or 
prison do not have access to pharmacies 
as required under § 423.120. It is a 
logical conclusion that incarcerated 
beneficiaries similarly would not have 
access to MA plan services, as required 
under § 422.112. Therefore, such an area 
could not meet the MA service area 
definition, which requires that such 
access standards be satisfied. 
Additionally, there is no reason for an 
individual to enroll in an MA plan 
while incarcerated, since basic health

care services typically are furnished by 
the jail or prison. Similarly, it would not 
be appropriate for an MA organization 
to receive monthly payments for such 
an individual, since medical services 
typically would be covered for the 
individual by the facility in which the 
individual is incarcerated. Such 
payments would represent an 
unwarranted windfall for services the 
MA organization would not have to, and 
could not, deliver. Therefore, we are 
proposing to amend the definition of an 
MA plan ‘‘service area’’ at § 422.2 to 
exclude facilities in which individuals 
are incarcerated. 
C. Changes To Provide Plan Offerings 
With Meaningful Differences 
This section addresses proposed 
changes to our regulations designed to 
foster plan offerings with meaningful 
differences. One of the underlying 
principles in the establishment of the 
Medicare Part D prescription drug 
benefit and the revisions to the 
Medicare managed care program 
resulting from the MMA was that both 
market competition and the flexibility 
provided to MA organizations and Part 
D sponsors in the statute would result 
in the offering of a broad array of cost- 
effective health and prescription drug 
coverage options for Medicare 
beneficiaries. Indeed, in the several 
years since implementation of the 
MMA, private health plans have taken 
full advantage of the opportunity to 
offer a wide array of health care plans 
and prescription drug benefit packages 
to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, 
since 2006, Medicare beneficiaries 
throughout the United States have had 
available to them a multiplicity of 
health care and prescription drug 
options offered by a substantial number 
of private sector entities. We continue to 
support the concept of offering a wide 
variety of health plan and prescription 
drug coverage choices for Medicare 
beneficiaries consistent with our 
commitment to afford beneficiaries 
access to high value health care. 
However, based on several years of 
experience with the MA and Part D 
programs, we have learned that 
although beneficiaries need access to a 
variety of alternative plan options, 
benefit packages must represent 
significant differences to ensure 
meaningful choices. As noted 
previously, we have attempted to work 
with Part D sponsors since 2006 to 
reduce the number of offerings from 
PDP sponsors as well as to convey 
information about Part D plan benefit 
designs in ways that are meaningful and 
understandable to beneficiaries. For 
example, we provide information about 
the various local MA plan and PDP 
options available to beneficiaries in the 
health plan charts included in the 
annual Medicare & You publication. 
Because there are practical limitations 
to the display of detailed comparative 
information in a print format, we also 
provide comparative plan information 
through other vehicles. We post 
landscape files to our Web site (see 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/) that 
provide more detailed comparative 
information, such as information about 
benefit type and, for Part D, whether the 
plan has a $0 premium with full LIS 
subsidy, and a description of any gap 
coverage provided. This information is 
geared more toward beneficiary 
advocates and researchers than 
beneficiaries. 
In addition, because a static 
description of plan benefits design 
features does not suffice to allow 
meaningful comparisons between drug 
plans, we also design and maintain the 
Medicare Options Compare (MOC) and 
the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan 
Finder (MPDPF) Web tool. These Web 
tools allow beneficiaries to customize 
their comparisons based on their 
particular needs and thus compare plan 
benefit packages in a meaningful way. 
For example, the MPDPF allows 
beneficiaries or their representatives to 
develop customized comparisons that 
are sensitive to a beneficiary’s drug 
regimen, as well as tolerance for generic 
and therapeutic substitutes. Our goal in 
maintaining this tool is to strike a 
balance between the desire to provide as 
much information as possible to 
beneficiaries yet only provide 
information that is useful in making 
appropriate drug plan choices. We 
continue to look for ways to improve 
this tool and make information more 
understandable to beneficiaries and 
welcome comments in this area. 
Ensuring that Part C and D sponsors 
offer substantially different plan 
options, as the proposed regulatory 
changes discussed below are intended 
to do, will further maximize 
opportunities for beneficiaries to select 
benefit packages that meet their 
particular needs, while also 
streamlining and simplifying the plan 
selection process. 
Half of all Medicare beneficiaries have 
over 40 MA plan choices (this figure 
does not include special needs plans or 
employer group health plans which 
have additional criteria for enrollment), 
and many states offer 50 or more stand 
alone Part D plans, a number that can 
double when one includes Medicare 
Advantage plans with a Part D benefit. 
Several studies suggest that the MA and 
Part D program offerings are so 
numerous that they can be confusing. In 
a report by Marsha Gold of Mathematica 
Policy Research, Inc., for example, Gold 
writes of the MA program that ‘‘Existing 
research suggests that simplification 
may have advantages for beneficiaries,’’ 
and that one such advantage is 
preventing competitors to take 
advantage of the system ‘‘through 
product design.’’ 5 In his study, ‘‘How 
Much Choice is Too Much? The Case of 
the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Benefit,’’ T. Rice argues, based on Part 
D beneficiary studies that he and others 
in the field have conducted, that ‘‘The 
results show that decision quality [of 
seniors’ ability to choose plans with the 
lowest annual total cost] deteriorated as 
the number of plans increases.’’ 6 
As part of our goal of streamlining 
and simplifying the plan selection 
process for beneficiaries, we are also 
proposing to revise the nonrenewal 
regulations to expressly provide as a 
ground for nonrenewal the fact that an 
MA or Part D plan has failed to attract 
more than a small number of enrollees 
over a sustained period of time. In 
deciding whether to nonrenew a plan on 
this basis, we would expect to consider 
arguments as to why such low 
enrollment would be defensible in a 
particular situation (for example, the 
plan provides a benefit structure that is 
extremely important to its enrollees, 
despite the fact that they are small in 
number). 
In this section, we discuss our 
proposed revisions to both the bid 
submission and review processes and 
the nonrenewal regulations. We believe 
these proposed revisions will help us 
accomplish the balance we wish to 
strike with respect to encouraging 
competition and providing health plan 
and PDP choices to beneficiaries that 
represent meaningful choices in benefit 
packages. Table 3 outlines these 
proposed revisions.

1. Bid Submissions—Ensuring 
Significant Differences (§ 422.254 and 
§ 423.265) 
Consistent with our authority under 
section 1857(e)(1) of the Act, 
incorporated for Part D by section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act, to 
establish additional contract terms and 
our authority under section 1860D– 
11(d)(2)(B) of the Act to propose 
regulations imposing ‘‘reasonable 
minimum standards’’ on Part D 
sponsors, we propose to amend 
§ 422.254(a)(4) and § 423.265(b) to 
specify that, when submitting bids to 
contract as an MA organization or Part 
D plan sponsor for the following 
contract year, MAOs and Part D 
sponsors must ensure that they submit 
bids for multiple plans in the same area 
only if those plans have significant 
differences from each other in terms of 
key benefit or plan characteristics such 
as premiums, cost-sharing, formulary 
structure, or benefits offered. 
By proposing this change to our 
existing regulatory requirements 
regarding submission, review, and 
negotiation of bids, as well as CMS 
approval of plans, we aim to strengthen 
and build on our efforts to date to 
ensure a proper balance between 
affording beneficiaries a wide range of 
plan choices and avoiding undue 
beneficiary confusion in making 
coverage selections. Since 2005, we 
have reviewed Part D plan bids and 
negotiated with sponsors based on key 
benefit package characteristics, such as 
deductibles, substantial formulary 
differences, coverage in the coverage 
gap, and previous enrollment numbers. 
We also have reviewed plan offerings 
and negotiated with Part C contractors 
as part of our annual bid review and 
approval process, in an effort to identify 
and eliminate MA plans that appear to 
be duplicative. In connection with 2010 
plan offerings, for example, we 
contacted MAOs whose plans in a 
service area represented insignificant 
cost differences, as well as MAOs 
having MA plans with 100 or fewer 
enrollees, and conveyed our expectation 
that they consolidate or terminate such 
plans, when appropriate. 
We do not propose to specify in 
regulations text specific benefit package 
requirements or enrollment thresholds. 
Rather, it is our goal to permit MA 
organizations and PDP sponsors 
maximum flexibility to create plans 
with meaningful differences and, where 
warranted, to permit low enrollment 
plans to continue to operate when it is 
in the best interest of the program and 
of Medicare beneficiaries. We would 
issue guidance about the overall 
process, including the criteria for 
meaningful plan offerings and 
assessment of such offerings, in the 
annual Part C and D Call Letter. With 
this in mind, with respect to Part C, we 
would consider meaningful differences 
among plans offered by an MAO in a 
service area, as determined by CMS, to 
include a mix of plan types (for 
example, HMO, PPO, private FFS, or 
MSA plan), significant differences in 
plan benefit packages (the offering of a 
Part D benefit or a significant Part B 
buy-down, for example), or significant 
differences in premiums or cost-sharing 
(for example, a low premium-high cost- 
sharing plan versus a high premium-low 
cost-sharing plan) or aggregate costs to 
beneficiaries. In one possible scenario, 
under these general guidelines, we 
would particularly scrutinize whether 
there were sufficient differences among 
MA plan options if an MAO proposes to 
offer more than two plans of the same 
plan type in a service area. Even if only 
two plans of a given type are offered, 
they would, under our proposal, have to 
have meaningful differences relative to 
one another. For example, if two MA 
plans included a Part D benefit, we 
would require that there also be 
significant differences between these 
plans’ Part D benefits in terms of 
premiums, cost-sharing or other 
benefits. 
If the proposed new requirement is 
implemented, we would require that 
plans be dropped that do not offer 
meaningful choices for beneficiaries. In 
making determinations about what is a 
meaningful choice of plan type, we 
could view a PPO and an HMO with a 
POS benefit as being similar plan 
offering if the POS benefit covered all A 
and B services out of network. 
Similarly, a network private FFS plan 
and a PPO plan could also be viewed as 
similar plan offerings given the 
similarity in the access to services rules 
between these two MA plan types. 
With respect to Part D plans, we 
would continue to focus our analysis on 
whether there are significant differences 
in proposed beneficiary out-of-pocket 
costs as a result of the deductible 
amounts (for example, $0 deductible 
versus a $310 deductible) and cost share 
or coinsurance (for example, a $20 cost 
share versus a $45 cost share for 
preferred brand drugs). We also would 
evaluate plan formularies (for example, 
a 25 percent difference in the number of 
unique generic entities offered on the 
plans’ formularies). These factors are the 
most significant considerations that are 
applicable to all benefit types. We 
solicit comment on how big the 
differences between plan offerings need 
to be in order to be ‘‘meaningful’’ to 
beneficiaries. For example, is there a 
meaningful difference between an 
enhanced plan with a $0 deductible and 
no coverage in the gap versus an 
enhanced plan with a $0 deductible and 
coverage of 50 generic drugs in the gap? 
Additional benefit offerings such as 
free first fill programs and brand-name 
only deductibles may also be considered 
for the appropriate benefit types. In 
addition to the current considerations of 
formulary depth and breadth we may 
also consider the overall percent of 
utilization management applied to drugs 
and the specific types of utilization 
management (for example, prior 
authorization and step therapy). It is 
important to note that, even though a 
sponsor may submit different 
formularies for different plan offerings, 
all submitted formularies must be 
sufficiently robust to pass our rigorous 
formulary reviews and be determined 
not to discourage enrollment by certain 
types of beneficiaries. Based on our 
experience and given statutory actuarial 
equivalency requirements, we do not 
expect that, absent substantial 
differences in approved formularies, 
sponsors can demonstrate substantial 
differences between plans offering basic

prescription drug coverage. It is also our 
experience that sponsors typically must 
offer substantial coverage in the 
coverage gap as a supplemental benefit 
in order to demonstrate that one 
enhanced alternative plan design is 
substantially different from another. 
We are proposing that, in our review 
process, we would provide particular 
scrutiny in those market areas where 
multiple MAOs or Part D sponsors offer 
multiple plans. Specifically, we would 
particularly target our resources to our 
review for ‘‘meaningful differences’’ in 
areas where the elimination of 
duplicative plans would still leave a 
large number of plan options. For 
example, in the highly competitive 
Miami-Dade county market area, we 
might particularly focus our review on 
multiple HMO offerings from the same 
MAO in areas where additional HMO 
plans are not adding meaningful new 
choices for prospective enrollees. 
Similarly, we would particularly 
scrutinize Part D plan offerings from the 
same Part D sponsors for meaningful 
differences in regions where multiple 
plans with multiple benefit types (for 
example, enhanced alternative coverage, 
coverage in the gap) already exist. 
As we continue to accumulate 
program experience negotiating with 
MA organizations and Part D plan 
sponsors regarding bid submissions, it is 
our intent to apply these ‘‘lessons 
learned’’ both to our bid submission 
requirements and to our bid negotiation 
protocols. We expect to continue to 
determine whether there are substantial 
differences in plan types and benefit 
packages by looking at factors such as 
health plan benefit packages, cost- 
sharing, and deductibles, substantial 
formulary differences, and coverage in 
the coverage gap. We are soliciting 
comments on our proposed changes to 
the bid submission process. 
As discussed more fully in section 
II.B.5. of this proposed rule, we are also 
interested in building additional checks 
into our process to ensure that, in 
structuring bids that are sufficiently 
different from any other bid they may 
propose, MAOs and Part D sponsors do 
not design benefit packages that have 
the effect of discriminating against 
certain types of Medicare beneficiaries. 
This is consistent with our statutory 
authority in sections 1852(d)(1)(A) and 
1860D–11(e)(2)(D)(i) of the Act, which 
provide that we may disapprove a bid 
if we find that a plan’s proposed benefit 
design substantially discourages 
enrollment in that plan by certain 
Medicare-eligible individuals. 
In the context of the MA program, we 
are especially concerned about cost- 
sharing for certain high-cost services 
and would caution plans to ensure that 
when crafting plan packages with 
meaningful differences, they do not 
create discriminatory cost-sharing 
structures. We have the authority, under 
section 1852(b)(1) of the Act 
(implemented at § 422.110), to reject 
bids that we determine to be 
discriminatory. With respect to Part D 
sponsors, a plan that is considering an 
additional benefit package that is both 
nondiscriminatory and substantially 
different from its basic or enhanced 
alternative PDP offering(s) might choose 
to bid on enhanced alternative coverage 
that includes coverage of both some 
brand and generic drugs in the coverage 
gap. Depending on how this enhanced 
alternative coverage were structured, 
such a design could meet the threshold 
of being substantially different from a 
benefit package offering basic 
prescription drug coverage and/or an 
enhanced alternative benefit package 
that only offers coverage of certain 
excluded drugs, as provided in 
§ 423.104(f)(1)(ii)(A). 
2. Bid Review Process (§ 422.256 and 
§ 423.272) 
In order to further ensure that the 
benefit packages and plan cost 
structures offered by an MAO or Part D 
sponsor are meaningfully different, 
consistent with the preceding 
discussion, we propose to add 
§ 422.256(b)(4)(i) and § 423.272(b)(3)(i) 
to provide that we will only approve a 
bid submitted by an MAO or Part D 
sponsor if we find its plan benefit 
package to be substantially different 
from the plan benefit packages reflected 
in that sponsor’s other submitted bids in 
terms of key plan characteristics such as 
premiums, cost-sharing, formulary 
structure, or benefits offered. 
3. Transition Process in Cases of 
Acquisitions and Mergers (§ 422.256 
and § 423.272) 
Based on several years of program 
operational experience, we have also 
learned that when an MAO or Part D 
sponsor (or a parent organization to the 
sponsor) purchases another MAO or 
PDP sponsor, the result can be that the 
single parent organization offers plans 
through multiple subsidiaries of that 
same parent that are not substantially 
different from one another. In this 
specific situation, plan options may be 
designed by a subsidiary that has no 
incentive to compete against plans 
offered by other subsidiaries, which 
may result in multiple plan offerings by 
one sponsor or parent organization that 
do not represent substantial or truly 
meaningful choices to beneficiaries. 
In the 2008 Call Letter for Medicare 
health plans and PDPs, we announced 
a policy under which PDP sponsors or 
parent organizations with new 
acquisitions would be afforded a period 
of 3 years to transition their plan 
offerings to meet the goal of ensuring 
that the sponsor’s offerings were 
substantially different from one another. 
For example, a PDP sponsor (or its 
parent organization) completing an 
acquisition of another sponsor in 
November 2009 would not be subject to 
requirements for offering substantially 
different bids until the 2013 contract 
year (that is, bids would be due in June 
2010 for the 2011 program year; 
transition would occur during 2011 and 
2012; and the plan sponsor or parent 
would need to ensure that in June 2012, 
when it submits its bids for program 
year 2013, all of its 2013 bids are for 
substantially different plans). 
Consistent with existing policy, we 
propose adding a new paragraph 
§ 423.272(b)(3)(ii) providing for a 2-year 
transition period in the case of a merger 
of Part D plan sponsors or the 
acquisition of a Part D plan by another 
Part D plan sponsor or parent 
organization. We believe a 2-year 
transition period strikes a balance 
between allowing sponsors (or their 
parent organizations) with recent 
acquisitions sufficient time to 
streamline their operations after 
completion of an acquisition with the 
need to streamline and simplify 
beneficiary plan selection. We are 
proposing the 2-year transition instead 
of our current policy of 3 years based on 
our experience with Part D sponsors 
that have merged with or acquired other 
sponsors. Based on our experience, we 
believe that a 2-year period permits 
sponsors ample time to ensure that all 
plans offered represent significant 
differences, especially because, as 
indicated in the sample bidding cycle 
outlined above, we do not count the 
year of the merger or acquisition as part 
of the 2-year period. 
After a transition period of 2 years, we 
would only approve a bid submitted by 
a PDP sponsor, or a parent organization 
to that PDP sponsor, if the benefits or 
plan cost structure represented by that 
bid was substantially different from any 
other bid submitted by the same Part D 
sponsor (or parent organization to that 
Part D sponsor) in terms of key plan 
characteristics, such as premiums, cost- 
sharing, or formulary structure. 
We are also proposing to make a 
similar change so that MA plans 
acquired through purchase or merger 
offered by same MAO or parent 
organization reflect meaningful 
differences after a 2-year transition

period. We propose to codify this policy 
at § 422.256(b)(4)(ii). 
We request comments regarding the 
adequacy of our proposed transition 
period length of 2 years in both the MA 
and Part D contexts. 
4. Non-Renewing Low-Enrollment Plans 
(§ 422.506(b)(1)(iv) and 
§ 423.507(b)(1)(iii)) 
We are proposing to revise the Part C 
and Part D nonrenewal regulations to 
include, as a specific ground for 
nonrenewal, a finding that a plan has 
failed to attract a significant number of 
enrollees over a sustained period of 
time. We believe that, absent special 
circumstances, which we discuss below, 
a plan that has failed, over a sustained 
period, to attract enrollees is being 
operated in a manner ‘‘inconsistent with 
the efficient and effective 
administration’’ of the Part C or Part D 
programs, within the meaning of section 
1857(c)(2)(B) of the Act, which is 
incorporated into Part D by section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(B) of the Act, and thus 
would be subject to termination. 
In the 2010 Call Letter, we announced 
that MA organizations and PDP 
sponsors should terminate or 
consolidate low-enrollment Part C and 
D plans. In advance of the 2010 contract 
year, we have contacted MAO sponsors 
with enrollments of 100 beneficiaries or 
fewer for 2 or more years, conveying our 
expectation that the organization 
consolidate or terminate such plans. We 
now propose to add continuously low 
enrollment to the specific regulatory 
grounds for nonrenewal by CMS of an 
MA plan or PDP. We note that this 
requirement would be independent of 
the current requirement in § 422.514(a) 
and § 423.512(a) that MAOs and Part D 
sponsors meet minimum enrollment 
requirements at the organization level 
for purposes of entering into a contract 
with us. Those requirements apply to all 
enrollees of the organization, not 
enrollees in a particular plan. 
Although low enrollments often 
reflect lack of beneficiary interest in a 
plan, there are instances when low 
enrollment is a function of the type of 
beneficiaries served, geographic 
location, or other circumstance. 
Instances in which we would consider 
a waiver of the proposed requirements 
include but are not limited to a chronic 
care SNP offering health care services 
especially tailored to this category of 
beneficiaries not available elsewhere, or 
an employer group health plan offering 
benefits augmenting those of an MA 
plan to employees of a small business. 
If a case can be made that low 
enrollment is justified and the absence 
of such a plan would significantly limit 
beneficiary health care options in a 
service area, consistent with effective 
and efficient administration of the Part 
C or Part D benefit, we would not 
nonrenew that plan. Similarly, although 
we believe an enrollment of 100 or 
fewer beneficiaries for 2 or more years 
was a reasonable threshold for scrutiny 
under our 2010 assessment of MA plan 
enrollments, this number could 
fluctuate. As a result we are not 
proposing to revise our regulations to 
specify a specific threshold. If, using the 
principles described above, we identify 
an alternative threshold for scrutiny, we 
will include this information in our 
annual Call Letter. We solicit comment 
on this approach and whether we have 
provided sufficient clarity on how we 
will determine whether a low- 
enrollment plan will not be renewed. 
D. Changes To Improve Payment Rules 
and Processes 
This section addresses four payment 
issues under Part C. The first proposal 
outlines a new proposed dispute and 
appeal rights process for risk adjustment 
data validation audit findings that result 
in payment errors. The second proposal 
would require an actuarial certification 
for Part C bids. The third proposal 
under this section would clarify how 
health care prepayment plans (HCPP) 
and cost plans authorized under section 
1876 of the Act must determine 
acceptable administrative costs. Finally, 
the last proposal would update our 
regulations to eliminate a 2 percent 
minimum update for all rate 
calculations, other than end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD), for reasons we set forth 
below. These provisions are outlined in 
Table 4.

1. Risk Adjustment Data Validation 
Appeals (§ 422.310) 
a. Background 
Subpart G of the MA regulations at 
part 422 describes how payment is 
made to MA organizations. These 
payment principles are based on 
sections 1853, 1854, and 1858 of the 
Act. Subpart G also sets forth the 
requirements for making payments to 
MA organizations offering local and 
regional MA plans, including 
calculation of MA capitation rates. 
Section 1853(a)(3) of the Act requires 
that we risk adjust our payments to MA 
organizations. Risk adjustment 
strengthens the Medicare program by 
ensuring that accurate payments are 
made to MA organizations based on the 
health status plus demographic 
characteristics of their enrolled 
beneficiaries and ensures that MA 
organizations are paid appropriately for 
their plan enrollees (that is, less for 
healthier enrollees expected to incur 
lower health care costs and more for less 
healthy enrollees expected to incur 
higher health care costs). Accurate 
payments to MA organizations also help 
ensure that providers are paid 
appropriately for the services they 
provide to MA beneficiaries. In general, 
the current risk adjustment 
methodology relies on enrollee 
diagnoses, as specified by the 
International Classification of Disease, 
currently the Ninth Revision Clinical 
Modification guidelines (ICD–9–CM) to 
prospectively adjust capitation 
payments for a given enrollee based on 
the health status of the enrollee.

Diagnosis codes determine the risk 
scores, which in turn determine the risk 
adjusted reimbursement. As a result, 
physicians and providers must focus 
attention on complete and accurate 
diagnosis reporting according to the 
official ICD–9–CM coding guidelines 
(that is, coding diagnoses accurately and 
to the highest level of specificity). 
The current risk adjustment model 
employed in adjusting MA plan 
payments is known as the CMS 
Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS– 
HCC) model. It functions by categorizing 
ICD–9–CM codes into disease groups 
called Hierarchical Condition 
Categories, or HCCs. Each HCC includes 
diagnosis codes that are related 
clinically and have similar cost 
implications. The CMS–HCC model is 
recalibrated approximately every 2 years 
to reflect newer treatment and coding 
patterns in Medicare FFS. In 2007, a 
demographic data-only payment method 
was completely phased-out for MA 
plans, and 100 percent of payment was 
risk-adjusted. The statute continues to 
provide us the authority to add to, 
modify, or substitute for risk adjustment 
factors if the changes will improve the 
determination of actuarial equivalence. 
b. Risk Adjustment Data Validation 
Initiatives 
MA enrollee HCCs are assigned based 
on risk adjustment diagnoses from FFS 
claims and from risk adjustment data 
submitted to us by MA organizations via 
the Risk Adjustment Payment System 
(RAPS). The CMS–HCCs contribute to 
an enrollee’s risk score, which is used 
to adjust a base payment rate. 
Essentially, the higher the risk score for 
an enrollee, the higher the expected 
health care cost for the enrollee. The 
HCC data that MA organizations submit 
to CMS via the RAPS system is self- 
reported by the MA organization and 
does not go through a validation review 
before being incorporated into a given 
beneficiary’s risk-profile. Since there is 
an incentive for MA organizations to 
potentially over-report diagnoses so that 
they can increase their payment, the 
Agency audits plan-submitted diagnosis 
data a few years later to ensure they are 
supported by medical record 
documentation. 
Verifiable medical record 
documentation is the key to accurate 
payment and successful data validation. 
We annually select MA organizations 
for risk adjustment data validation 
(RADV) audits. RADV audits are 
intended to confirm the presence of risk 
adjustment conditions (that is, 
diagnoses that map to HCCs) as reported 
by MA organizations for their enrollees 
and confirmed via medical record 
documentation. RADV audits occur after 
the final risk adjustment data 
submission deadline for the MA 
contract year. We validate the HCC data 
submitted by MA organizations by 
reviewing hospital inpatient, hospital 
outpatient, and physician/practitioner 
provider medical records. The focus of 
this medical record review activity is on 
diagnoses related to the enrollee’s HCC 
profile. Risk adjustment discrepancies 
are identified when the enrollee’s HCCs 
used for payment (based upon MA 
organization-submitted data) differ from 
the HCCs assigned based on the medical 
record, pursuant to the RADV audit 
process. Risk adjustment discrepancies 
can be aggregated to determine an 
overall level payment error. In turn, 
payment error for a sample of contract 
enrollees can be extrapolated to 
calculate a contract-level payment error 
estimate. 
From 1999 until 2003, our payment 
validation activity for the M+C program 
had both an educational and audit focus 
and was intended to improve the 
accuracy of the risk adjustment data that 
was being submitted to CMS for 
payment. Payment adjustments were 
limited to enrollee-level adjustments for 
those enrollees sampled in the payment 
validation audit. At the time, only 10 
percent of the MA payment amount was 
risk adjusted. As a result, payment 
recovery amounts for the small number 
of plans audited was very small. Since 
payment year 2004 was the first year for 
which MA payments were based on the 
current HCC risk adjustment model, we 
considered payment years 2004 through 
2006 as pilot years for the purpose of 
RADV and no payment recovery activity 
occurred. For payment year 2007, we 
began conducting payment adjustments 
based on statistical RADV MA contract- 
level payment error audit findings. The 
existence of contract-level RADV audits 
is intended to enable us to make 
contract-level payment adjustments 
rather than simply adjusting payments 
for specific enrollees from an audit 
sample as we have done previously. 
On July 17, 2008, we announced a 
pilot program to more extensively audit 
MA organizations for payment year 
2007 based on calendar year 2006 
payment data. In this notice, we 
announced its plans to make contract- 
level payment adjustments using 
payment error findings from a sample of 
enrollees from each of the selected 
contracts. This was a major change to 
our RADV audit approach in that it 
signaled for the first time the Agency’s 
intent to recover MA organization 
contract-level payments. As a 
consequence, this would result in 
substantially larger payment error than 
the previous enrollee-level audits. In 
2009, we expanded its RADV audits to 
randomly selected MA organizations 
and MA organizations targeted because 
of the results of an earlier coding 
intensity study. Both the random and 
targeted RADV audits were intended to 
generate statistically valid contract-level 
payment error estimates based on 2007 
payments. 
c. RADV Error-Rate Calculation 
Disputes and Reconsiderations 
Neither the MMA nor existing 
Medicare Advantage regulations 
expressly provide for an administrative 
appeals process that would apply to 
RADV-related disputes involving MA 
organizations undergoing RADV audits. 
Until 2008, because RADV audit 
payment adjustments were limited to 
sampled beneficiary-level findings only, 
the overall impact of these payment 
adjustments on MA organizations was 
relatively small. Nevertheless, affected 
MA organizations requested that we 
provide some type of appeal remedy for 
disputing RADV audit results. In 
response to this request, for the RADV 
audit activity that occurred for payment 
year 2005, MA organizations that 
disputed our RADV audit findings were 
permitted to do so via an administrative 
process known as documentation 
dispute. Under documentation dispute, 
MA organizations selected for RADV 
audit could dispute enrollee-level HCC 
findings based on the application of the 
ICD–9–CM guidelines. This 
documentation dispute process allowed 
MA organizations to submit new 
medical record documentation and 
clarifying documentation. Our medical 
record review contractors reviewed this 
clarifying documentation via the 
documentation dispute process and if 
this documentation overturned the 
initial discrepancy determination, the 
contractor would recalculate the MA 
organization’s payment error estimate 
and make payment adjustments based 
upon the revised payment error 
estimate. 
d. Proposed Addition of Medicare 
Advantage Organization Risk 
Adjustment Data Validation—Dispute 
and Appeal Procedures 
Our experience to date in conducting 
RADV audits has led us to propose 
affording MA organizations undergoing 
RADV audits the formal dispute and 
appeal rights as possible remedies for 
RADV audit findings that result in 
payment errors. Since neither the statute 
nor existing MA program regulations 
specify RADV dispute or appeal 
requirements, we are, under our 
authority to establish MA program

54675 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
standards by regulation at section 
1856(b)(1) of the Act, proposing 
additions to part 422, subpart G at new 
§ 422.311, to specify RADV dispute and 
appeal rights for MA organizations. 
Specifically, we propose allowing MA 
organizations that have undergone 
RADV audit(s) to—(1) submit physician 
and other practitioner signed 
attestations for physician and other 
outpatient medical records with missing 
or illegible signature and/or credentials 
that could result in a payment error; (2) 
dispute certain other types of medical 
record review-related errors through the 
use of a documentation dispute process; 
and (3) appeal our RADV payment error 
calculation. By availing themselves of 
these RADV dispute and appeal 
processes, MA organizations may be 
able to reduce their RADV payment 
error and thereby, reduce their overall 
estimated MA payment error. Therefore, 
we are proposing the following 
provisions under part 422: 
• At § 422.2, we provide definitions 
of six terms that pertain to Risk 
Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) 
activities and thereby, relate to our 
proposals for implementing RADV 
dispute and appeal processes. 
• At § 422.311, we propose adding a 
new section to Subpart G—RADV audit 
dispute and appeal processes— 
describing procedures that we would 
implement to afford MA organizations 
undergoing RADV audits the 
opportunity to have certain potential 
RADV payment errors addressed in 
advance of RADV-audit-related payment 
error determinations being made, and 
other types of confirmed payment errors 
overturned. At § 422.311(a) and (b), we 
summarize the procedures that we 
undertake to conduct RADV audits of 
MA organizations. Beginning with 
§ 422.311(c), we propose implementing 
three RADV-related dispute and appeal 
procedures that MA organizations could 
undertake to reduce their RADV 
payment error to include— 
• Physician/practitioner 
attestation(s); 
• Documentation dispute; and 
• RADV payment error calculation 
appeal. 
Analysis of data originating from 
medical records submitted by MA 
organizations that have undergone 
RADV audit indicates that a substantial 
percentage of medical record-related 
payment error determinations are due to 
missing or illegible signature or 
credentials on medical records. 
Medicare program rules dictate the 
necessity of physician signatures on 
medical records, and MA risk 
adjustment requirements dictate that 
risk adjustment diagnosis data be 
accepted from health services that were 
conducted by certain physician 
specialties. Therefore, RADV 
requirements dictate that in addition to 
the presence of diagnosis information 
that would support HCCs submitted by 
MA organizations, physician signatures 
and credentials must be present on 
medical records. Medical records with 
missing or illegible signatures and/or 
credentials are scored as errors under 
RADV audit procedures. We estimate 
that if given the opportunity to do so, 
many physicians and other practitioners 
that provided the diagnosis information 
on RADV-reviewed medical records 
would in fact attest that they 
documented the information in these 
medical records, even though signatures 
and credentials were missing. The 
presence of a signature or credential 
attestation to accompany these medical 
records would in our opinion, provide 
justification for preventing both 
contract-level and national-level RADV 
payment errors that may otherwise 
originate from medical record signature 
and/or credential discrepancies only. 
They would not, however, be acceptable 
to address any issues outside the RADV 
audit process. 
Therefore, under our authority to 
establish MA program standards by 
regulation at section 1856(b)(1) of the 
Act and the authority at section 
1853(a)(3) of the Act to risk adjust 
payments for MA organizations, at 
newly established § 422.311(c)(1), we 
are proposing to implement a process 
that would allow MA organizations to 
voluntarily submit CMS attestations 
(that is, only attestations developed and 
pre-populated by CMS). These 
attestations would be signed by 
physicians/practitioners who would 
attest responsibility for conducting and 
documenting the health services in the 
physician and outpatient medical 
record(s) being submitted for RADV 
audit. We specify at § 422.311(c)(1)(ii) 
and (iii) that MA organizations would 
be eligible to use attestations to address 
signature and/or credential-related 
discrepancies only from physician or 
outpatient medical records; attestations 
would not be allowed to address 
signature and/or credential-related 
discrepancies found on inpatient 
medical records. We do not believe it is 
necessary to permit attestations for 
inpatient medical records. The proposed 
use of an attestation would not in any 
way supplant the medical record, nor 
would it permit attesting physicians/ 
practitioners to alter the existing 
medical record. 
Based on our recent RADV 
experience, the percentage of payment 
error associated with signature and 
credentials for inpatient medical records 
is relatively small. Furthermore, MA 
organizations would not be permitted to 
use attestations as a vehicle for 
introducing new HCCs for payment 
consideration. 
At § 422.311(c)(1)(C)(iv), we indicate 
that we would prospectively notify MA 
organizations that if their one best 
medical record necessary to validate an 
audited HCC was missing a physician/ 
practitioner signature or credential, the 
MA organization would be permitted to 
submit a CMS RADV attestation along 
with the medical record, to fulfill the 
requirement that medical records 
contain physician/practitioner 
signatures and credentials. 
We describe the process that we 
would jointly undertake to review 
attestations submitted for our review at 
§ 422.311(c)(1)(iv) and (v). Only CMS- 
generated attestations that meet certain 
requirements described at 
§ 422.311(c)(1) and (d) are eligible for 
consideration. Failure to meet these 
requirements would result in us not 
reviewing submitted attestations. CMS 
attestations that have been altered or 
amended (for example, striking out pre- 
populated words and replacing them 
with hand-written replacement words) 
without instruction or written 
confirmation by CMS will not be 
accepted. Attestations must accompany 
the medical record at the same time that 
the medical record is submitted to CMS 
for RADV audit. MA organizations may 
not submit attestations before or after 
submission of their RADV medical 
records. Attestations must originate 
from the physician/practitioner whose 
medical record accompanies and 
corresponds to the attestation. We will 
not accept attestations or medical 
records from any party other than the 
MA organization. Organizations may not 
submit attestations during the 
documentation dispute or RADV 
reconsideration processes described at 
§ 422.311(c)(2 and 3). At 
§ 422.311(c)(1)(iv), we describe the 
process that we would undertake to 
review attestations and notify appellant 
MA organizations of the results of these 
attestation reviews. Our attestation 
review determinations would be final 
and binding upon both parties and 
would otherwise not be eligible for 
further appeal. 
We believe this proposal benefits both 
MA organizations and the Government. 
First, MA organizations will be 
provided an opportunity to prevent 
substantially high RADV payment errors 
that would otherwise be associated with 
signature and/or credential errors. 
Second, we benefit by being able to 
report RADV payment errors that

54676 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
originate primarily from the lack of 
diagnosis data necessary to justify 
submitted HCCs rather than missing 
signatures and/or credentials or the lack 
of legible signature and/or credentials. 
We believe that this is an important 
distinction given the underlying 
principles of the risk adjustment 
payment model—a model that pays MA 
organizations less for healthy enrollees 
and more for less-healthy enrollees 
based upon the existence of diagnostic 
data in enrollee medical records. 
We further propose affording MA 
organizations the option of disputing 
other non-signature or credential-types 
of RADV-related medical record 
diagnosis coding discrepancies via a 
proposed documentation dispute 
process that we describe in new 
paragraph § 422.311(c)(2) et seq. This 
proposal is based upon our authority to 
establish MA program standards by 
regulation at section 1856(b)(1) of the 
Act and the authority at section 
1853(a)(1)(G) of the Act to risk adjust 
payments for MA organizations. In order 
to be eligible for documentation dispute, 
MA organizations must submit their one 
best medical record to us in accordance 
with RADV medical record submission 
deadlines established by CMS during 
the RADV medical record request 
process. 
At § 422.311(c)(2)(a), we specify the 
types of RADV-related errors that would 
be eligible for the documentation 
dispute process. The documentation 
dispute process will apply only to the 
errors that arise out of operational 
processing of medical records selected 
for RADV audit and submitted to CMS 
by established deadlines. In this 
context, errors that arise from 
operational processing mean errors that 
arise from the collection and processing 
of medical records for RADV audit. For 
example, if an MA organization submits 
a two-page medical record that 
inadvertently becomes separated into 
‘‘two’’ medical records upon receipt by 
the CMS Medical Record Review 
Contractor—we would permit the MA 
organization to resubmit the two-page 
medical record so that the record can be 
reviewed in its intended two-page 
format. At § 422.311(c)(2)(ii), we specify 
the limitations that we would impose 
upon the documentation dispute 
process, namely that MA organizations 
would not be permitted to dispute any 
medical record coding discrepancies, 
nor would MA organizations be 
permitted to submit altogether new 
medical records in place of previously 
submitted medical records. Payment 
errors that resulted from missing 
medical records will not be eligible for 
documentation dispute. A missing 
medical record means that no medical 
record documentation was submitted by 
the formal CMS-established deadline. 
MA organizations would not be 
permitted to use the documentation 
dispute process as a mechanism for 
establishing new HCCs for payment 
consideration. In this context, the term 
‘‘new HCC’’ means an HCC that was not 
previously assigned to an enrollee, 
because no associated risk adjustment 
diagnosis data was submitted to CMS 
for payment. 
At § 422.311(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), we 
indicate that we would prospectively 
notify MA organizations of RADV 
payment errors that would be eligible 
for documentation dispute, describe the 
documentation dispute process that we 
would undertake, along with the 
process that we will undertake to notify 
MA organizations of the results of 
documentation dispute reviews. As 
described at § 422.311(c)(2)(v), our 
documentation dispute review 
determination would be final and 
binding upon both parties and would 
not otherwise be eligible for further 
administrative appeal. 
We believe affording MA 
organizations the ability to dispute the 
operational processing of those medical 
records that are submitted timely offers 
MA organizations and CMS a balanced 
approach for disputing a significant 
portion of RADV errors. It also does so 
in a manner that benefits both MA 
organizations and the Government. 
Allowing MA organizations to dispute 
CMS’ operational processing errors 
provides MA organizations an 
opportunity to overturn certain types of 
RADV payment errors and thereby 
reduce their overall RADV payment 
error. However, the approach we 
recommend here that limits MA 
organizations to disputing only certain 
types of errors ensures that the integrity 
of the CMS’ RADV audit process 
remains intact. We believe this is an 
important consideration in developing 
an RADV dispute process that balances 
the desires of the MA industry and the 
program integrity interests of the 
Federal Government. To date, some MA 
organizations that have undergone 
RADV audit have been dissatisfied with 
our medical record review processes 
and have petitioned CMS to allow 
additional opportunities to validate 
HCCs selected for audit. Given the rigor 
of our existing RADV audit procedures 
generally and multi-faceted medical 
record review procedures specifically, 
we believe this is unnecessary. Indeed, 
we believe that it is important to 
understand that while the RADV 
medical record review process is 
intentionally a rigorous procedure that 
is carried out by several independent 
CMS contractors, we have structured the 
overall medical record review process 
so that MA organizations can 
successfully submit requested medical 
records necessary to validate diagnoses 
that were sent to us for determining 
payments under risk adjustment. 
The rigor surrounding the RADV 
medical record review process is well 
established and has been known to the 
MA industry for several years. For 
purposes of clarity and context, we 
summarize that process here. To 
validate the CMS–HCCs selected for 
audit, MA organizations need only 
submit medical record documentation 
for each enrollee CMS–HCC requested 
by CMS for the specified audit time 
frame. The medical record must reflect 
a date of service that occurred during 
the respective audit period. We instruct 
each MA organization to select and 
submit the one best medical record 
necessary to support each enrollee 
CMS–HCC being validated. 
Furthermore, we provide each MA 
organization undergoing RADV audit 12 
weeks to submit the one best medical 
record for validation. Once requested 
medical records have been received, for 
any identified RADV errors, we conduct 
two rounds of medical record review by 
two independent contractors. Medical 
record review contractors employ 
certified coders to review medical 
records. The purpose of the second 
independent medical record review is to 
confirm discrepancies found in the 
initial review. To ensure the integrity of 
the medical record review process and 
the accuracy of the medical record 
review findings, the second medical 
record review contractor is blind to the 
findings from the first medical record 
review contractor when it examines 
medical records that the first medical 
record review contractor determined 
were discrepant. Further, all discrepant 
records with coding discrepancies are 
reviewed twice. First they are reviewed 
by a primary coder and then they are 
forwarded to a senior-level expert coder 
for review confirmation. As needed, 
consultation from physicians is also 
provided. Finally, we undertake robust 
medical record coder inter-rater 
reliability (IRR) testing to ensure that 
medical record review activity is 
consistent and the application of CMS 
RADV coding guidelines are applied 
uniformly and fairly. 
Together in its entirety, we believe the 
RADV medical record review process is 
thorough and it affords MA 
organizations ample opportunity to 
successfully meet RADV audit 
standards. We believe that affording MA 
organizations additional opportunities

54677 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
for attestation and documentation 
dispute to meet CMS’ RADV medical 
record documentation standards, 
beyond those specified at proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(1) and(2) et seq., would be 
an unnecessary use of government 
resources that is unlikely to result in 
any meaningful change in RADV audit 
results. 
Pursuant to our authority to establish 
MA program standards by regulation at 
section 1856(b)(1) of the Act and the 
authority at section 1853(a)(1)(G) of the 
Act to risk adjust payments for MA 
organizations, we are adding 
§ 422.311(c)(3) to establish an appeals 
process whereby RADV payment error 
calculations may be subject to appeal. 
Unlike our proposed attestation process 
described at § 422.311(c)(1) and 
proposed documentation dispute 
process describe at § 422.311(c)(2) 
which afford MA organizations the 
opportunity to dispute aspects of our 
medical record review process, the 
RADV payment error calculation appeal 
process is specifically designed to afford 
MA organizations the opportunity to 
appeal our contract-level RADV 
payment error calculation. Under the 
proposed RADV payment error 
calculation appeal process, we are 
establishing a three-level appeal process 
whereby MA organizations may— 
• Seek reconsideration; 
• Appeal the reconsideration decision 
to an independent CMS hearing officer; 
and 
• Appeal the decision of the 
independent CMS hearing officer to the 
CMS Administrator. 
Unlike the proposed attestation and 
documentation dispute processes 
described in our proposed regulations at 
§ 422.311(c)(1) and (c)(2), our proposed 
RADV payment error calculation appeal 
process has several layers of appeal 
available to MA organizations. Our 
proposed dispute processes described at 
§ 422.311(c)(1) and (c)(2) afford MA 
organizations only one level of dispute 
consideration because the RADV 
medical record audit process already 
provides multiple layers of strong and 
overlapping review and independence. 
These measures ensure robust layers of 
internal checks and balances that help 
maintain the integrity of the medical 
record review process. Therefore, we do 
not believe that the attestation or 
document dispute processes require 
additional levels of dispute. Given the 
complexity of RADV audits in general, 
and the calculation of RADV-related 
error rates in particular, we do believe 
it’s prudent to afford appellate MA 
organizations multiple-layers of RADV- 
related payment error appeal. 
At § 422.311(c)(3)(ii) we specify that 
MA organizations may not under the 
RADV payment error calculation appeal 
process appeal medical record review 
errors nor may MA organizations seek 
formal appeal of physician or 
practitioner signature or credential- 
related review errors. Medical record 
review-related issues will be resolved as 
a result of the rigorous medical record 
review process and the proposed 
attestation and documentation dispute 
processes described earlier in this 
proposed regulation. In accordance with 
our proposed regulation at 
§ 422.311(c)(3)(i), the RADV payment 
error calculation appeals process only 
applies to errors identified in the RADV 
payment error calculation. MA 
organizations cannot utilize the 
payment error calculation appeal 
process as a method for submitting any 
medical records for consideration in the 
calculation of the payment error. In 
order to be eligible for RADV payment 
error calculation appeal, MA 
organizations must adhere to 
established RADV audit requirements, 
including the submission of medical 
records in the manner and by the 
deadlines specified by CMS. 
Furthermore, MA organizations 
cannot appeal the CMS’ payment error 
calculation methodology. Our 
justification for excluding 
methodological appeals is two-fold. 
First, the methodology that we employ 
to calculate RADV payment errors is 
methodologically sound and 
academically defensible. We intend to 
ensure that all MA organizations 
understand the RADV payment error 
calculation methodology by providing 
annual notice to all MA organizations of 
the methodology that will be employed 
for calculating Part C payment errors. 
MA organizations that object to CMS’ 
RADV payment error calculation 
methodology will be given an 
opportunity to provide comment to us 
under the Agency’s annual notice of 
RADV audit methodology. Second, in 
addition to providing an annual notice 
of RADV audit methodology, we will 
provide an expanded explanation of 
methodology as part of each audit report 
of findings that we send to MA 
organizations that undergo RADV audit. 
Included in this expanded explanation 
of methodology will be RADV payment 
error calculation factors unique to each 
audited MA organization that will 
enable the MA organization to 
independently calculate its own RADV 
payment error. 
At § 422.311(c)(3)(iii) and (v), we 
specify that MA organizations will be 
notified of their RADV payment error 
calculation appeal rights at the time 
CMS issues a RADV audit report to that 
organization. MA organizations will 
have 30 days from the date of this notice 
to submit a written request for 
reconsideration of its RADV payment 
error calculation. A request for 
reconsideration must specify the issues 
with which the MA organization 
disagrees, the reasons for the 
disagreements and explain why the 
organization believes the issues are 
eligible for reconsideration. The request 
for reconsideration may include 
additional documentary evidence that 
the MA organization considers material 
to the reconsideration, though MA 
organizations are prohibited from 
submitting medical record-related 
evidence such as new or previously 
submitted medical records or physician 
or practitioner attestations and from 
appealing any issues pertaining to the 
methodology applied in any part of the 
RADV audit. At § 422.311(c)(3)(iv), we 
further specify that the MA organization 
bears the burden of proof to demonstrate 
that CMS’ RADV payment error 
calculation was clearly incorrect. 
We describe the proposed conduct of 
a RADV payment error calculation 
reconsideration, the decision of the 
reconsideration official and the effect of 
the CMS reconsideration decision 
official at § 422.311(c)(3)(e) and (f). 
At § 422.311(c)(3)(v) and (vi), we 
describe the first level of RADV 
payment error calculation appeal, the 
request for reconsideration of our RADV 
payment error calculation. Under this 
process a CMS official or our contractor 
not otherwise involved in error-rate 
calculation activity reviews our RADV 
payment error calculation and any 
written evidence submitted by the MA 
organization that pertains to CMS’ 
RADV payment error calculation, 
recalculates the payment error utilizing 
our RADV payment error calculation 
methodology as specified in our 
standard operating procedures, and 
renders a determination whether the 
RADV payment error calculation is 
accurate. This CMS official or CMS 
contractor (not otherwise involved in 
RADV error-rate calculation activity) 
may calculate and arrive at a different 
RADV payment error. Whether the 
official or contractor agrees with our 
payment error calculation or overturns 
this calculation and establishes a new 
RADV payment error, this party’s RADV 
payment error calculation determination 
is issued to a CMS reconsideration 
official. The CMS reconsideration 
official reviews their analysis and makes 
a determination whether to accept or 
reject the findings of the CMS official or 
CMS contractor that recalculated the 
RADV payment error. In instances when

the CMS official or contractor 
recommends overturning CMS’ RADV 
payment error calculation and the 
reviewing CMS reconsideration official 
agrees with the newly calculated RADV 
payment error, we issue a 
reconsideration decision which informs 
the appealing MA organization in 
writing of its reconsideration decision, 
in effect, notifying the MA organization 
of its new RADV payment error. If the 
reconsideration official upholds the 
decision of the CMS official or 
contractor to sustain our initial RADV 
payment error calculation, the 
reconsideration official similarly 
notifies the appellant MA organization 
of its determination. In either instance, 
the decision of the reconsideration 
official is final and binding unless a 
request for hearing is filed by CMS or 
the appellant MA organization. 
At § 422.311(c)(4), we propose to 
allow CMS or MA organizations that are 
dissatisfied with the decision of the 
CMS reconsideration official described 
at § 422.311(c)(3) et seq., to request a 
second level of RADV payment error 
calculation appeal, a hearing on their 
RADV payment error calculation 
determination. CMS or MA 
organizations choosing to pursue a 
hearing must file a request for hearing 
within 30 days of the date the MA 
organization receives our written RADV 
payment error calculation 
reconsideration decision as described at 
§ 422.311(c)(3)(vi). CMS or MA 
organizations requesting a hearing must 
do so in writing, include a copy of the 
CMS reconsideration official’s decision 
to either uphold or overturn our RADV 
payment error calculation, and specify 
the findings or issues in that 
reconsideration decision that they 
disagree with and why they disagree 
with them. The hearing will be 
conducted by the CMS Office of 
Hearings and presided over by a CMS 
Hearing Officer who neither receives 
testimony nor accepts any new evidence 
that was not presented with the request 
for reconsideration of the RADV 
payment error calculation. The hearing 
will be held on the record, unless the 
parties request, subject to the hearing 
officer’s discretion, a live or telephonic 
hearing. The hearing officer may also 
schedule a live or telephonic hearing 
upon their own motion. The CMS 
hearing officer is limited to the review 
of the record that was before us when 
we made both our initial RADV 
payment error calculation and our 
reconsidered RADV payment error 
calculation. 
The hearing officer has full power to 
make rules and establish procedures, 
consistent with the law, regulations, and 
CMS rulings. These powers include the 
authority to take appropriate action in 
response to failure of an organization to 
comply with such procedures. 
As described at proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(4)(iv), the CMS hearing 
officer reviews and decides whether the 
reconsideration official’s decision was 
correct and notifies CMS and the MA 
organization in writing of his/her 
decision, explaining the basis for the 
decision. In effect, the CMS hearing 
officer’s ruling either upholds or 
overturns the RADV payment error 
calculation. The Hearing Officer does 
not recalculate the error and offer either 
party an alternative RADV payment 
error. In instances where the hearing 
officer overturns the RADV payment 
error calculation, the hearing officer 
issues their written determination to 
CMS and the MA organization, in effect, 
notifying both parties that we must 
recalculate the organization’s RADV 
payment error. If the Hearing Officer 
upholds the decision of the CMS 
reconsideration official regarding the 
RADV payment error calculation, the 
Hearing Officer similarly notifies CMS 
and the MA organization of his/her 
determination. The Hearing Officer’s 
decision is final and binding, unless the 
decision is reversed or modified by the 
CMS Administrator in accordance with 
§ 422.311(c) (5). 
The third level of RADV payment 
error calculation appeal that MA 
organizations can request is 
discretionary review by the CMS 
Administrator. We describe this 
proposed process at § 422.311(c)(5) et 
seq. At this level of appeal, CMS or the 
MA organization can appeal the 
decision of the CMS Hearing Officer by 
requesting that the CMS Administrator 
review the CMS Hearing Officer’s 
determination. Parties requesting CMS 
Administrator review would have to 
request the review within 30 days of 
receipt of the CMS Hearing Officer’s 
determination. If the Administrator 
agrees to review the case, the 
Administrator reviews the Hearing 
Officer’s decision as well as any other 
information included in the record of 
the Hearing Officer’s decision and 
determines whether to uphold, reverse, 
or modify the CMS Hearing Officer’s 
decision. The Administrator’s 
determination is final and binding. 
Based on our experience with appeals 
of MA and Medicare Part D program 
contract determinations, we have 
determined that it is necessary for us to 
establish a ‘‘compliance date’’ to use as 
a reference point in issuing a ruling 
regarding RADV audit findings. By way 
of this proposed regulation at 
§ 422.311(b)(2), we are requiring that the 
compliance date for meeting Federal 
regulations requiring MA organizations 
to submit medical records for the 
validation of risk adjustment data, 
(§ 422.310(e)) also be the due date when 
MA organizations (or their contractor(s)) 
selected for RADV audit, must submit 
medical records to CMS. We will inform 
an MA organization in writing regarding 
selection for RADV audit including the 
due date for submission of medical 
records. Without a specific date as a 
reference point for evaluating 
compliance, MA organizations could 
choose to assert that while they were 
unable to meet RADV audit 
requirements on the date we specified 
as the due date for medical record 
submission, they were later able to do 
so. Under this scenario, organizations 
would be free to assert the right to 
submit medical records in place of, or 
in addition to, records that were, or, 
were not, as the case may be, submitted 
to us by the RADV audit due date. 
Accordingly, if we proceeded to 
conduct our RADV audit, issue a report 
of findings, and attempt to collect any 
identified overpayments, affected MA 
organizations could counter that while 
they did not have medical records to 
justify a particular HCC-level payment 
at the time due, they now have such 
records. Therefore, we should re-open 
the audit, review the new medical 
records and adjust our report of findings 
accordingly. The medical record review 
process could continue ad-infinitum, 
preventing us from closing out RADV 
audits and collecting any identified 
overpayments. 
We welcome comments on all aspects 
of these proposed rules. 
2. Payments to Medicare Advantage 
Organizations—Actuarial Valuation 
(§ 422.254) 
We propose to amend the regulation 
to expressly require an actuarial 
certification for Part C bids. 
Operationally, we require an actuarial 
certification to accompany every bid, for 
both Parts C and D. A qualified 0actuary 
who is a Member of the American 
Academy of Actuaries (MAAA) must 
complete the certification. The objective 
of obtaining an actuarial certification is 
to place greater responsibility on the 
actuary’s professional judgment and to 
hold him/her accountable for the 
reasonableness of the assumptions and 
projections. This requirement is already 
set forth in the part D regulations at 
§ 423.265(c)(3). This proposed change in 
the part C regulation text will bring the 
part C regulation at § 422.254(b)(5) in 
line with current requirements and Part 
D.

3. Determination of Acceptable 
Administrative Costs by Cost Contracts 
and Health Care Prepayment Plans 
(§ 417.564) 
Our requirements for the 
apportionment and allocation of 
administrative and general costs for 
health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) 
authorized under section 1833(a)(1)(A) 
of the Act and cost contractors 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act are set forth at § 417.564. As 
provided under § 417.802(a), with 
limited exceptions, allowable costs for 
HCPP reimbursement are the same as 
those for reasonable cost HMOs and 
CMPs as specified in Subpart O of Part 
417. Both section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the 
Act (for HCPPs) and section 1876(h)(2) 
of the Act (for cost HMOs and CMPs) 
incorporate the definition of 
‘‘reasonable cost’’ in section 1861(v) of 
the Act, which used to govern 
reimbursement to providers of services 
under Part A prior to the enactment of 
Prospective Payment Systems (PPS). 
Because that definition was originally 
established with respect to Original 
Medicare providers, we believe that it is 
appropriate to interpret and apply the 
principles in section 1861(v) in the 
managed care context. We accordingly 
propose to revise the regulations 
governing payments to HCPPs and cost 
HMOs/CMPs to clarify how we believe 
the reasonable cost principles in section 
1861(v) should apply to HCPPs and 
HMOs/CMPs by specifying the 
methodologies that must be used in 
determining the different allowable 
administrative costs for both such 
entities. 
We have noted in recent audits of 
HCPP and section 1876 cost contractors 
uncertainty regarding what constitutes a 
‘‘reasonable’’ level of administrative 
costs incurred by these entities. In 
conducting audits, we have not always 
been able to confirm that HCPP and cost 
contractors authorized under section 
1876 of the Act were calculating their 
administrative costs in a manner that 
has allowed us to verify that they have 
followed appropriate practices. 
In order to remove any uncertainty on 
the part of HCPP and cost contractors 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act, we propose revising § 417.564(b)(2) 
to clarify how HCPP and cost 
contractors authorized under section 
1876 of the Act must determine 
‘‘reasonable’’ administrative costs. As 
proposed at § 417.564(b)(2)(iii), 
personnel costs claimed in 
administering both HCPP and cost 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act must be linked to the specific 
administrative function performed by 
persons, at a specific rate of pay, for a 
specified period of time. We also 
propose to clarify that this level of 
information must be available to CMS 
upon request or in the course of a 
review. Additionally, we propose 
revising § 417.564 by adding a new 
paragraph (c) that specifies that, in order 
for costs to be considered ‘‘reasonable 
costs’’ within the meaning of section 
1861(v) of the Act, which expressly 
excludes ‘‘incurred cost found to be 
unnecessary in the efficient delivery of 
needed health services,’’ the following 
costs must be excluded when 
computing reimbursable administrative 
costs: 
• Donations. 
• Fines and penalties. 
• Political and lobbying activities. 
• Charity and courtesy allowances. 
• Spousal education. 
• Entertainment. 
• Return on equity. 
Because we are simply clarifying our 
reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements, by clarifying what costs 
an HCPP may report in its cost report as 
administrative costs for reimbursement 
by the government, we do not believe 
this provision would increase burden or 
costs for plan sponsors. However, we 
solicit comment on our assumptions. 
4. Calculation of the Minimum 
Percentage Increase Under Part C 
(§ 422.306) 
Section 5301 of the DRA added 
section 1853(k) of the Act to create a 
single rate book for calculating MA 
payments and applicable adjustments. 
The DRA also modified the 
methodology for updating the MA 
payment rates by adding section 
1853(k)(1)(B) of the Act. Beginning in 
2007, the statute requires for purposes 
of calculating the minimum percentage 
increase rate that the previous year’s 
benchmarks be updated annually using 
only the national per capita MA growth 
percentage as described in section 
1853(c)(6) of the Act. Prior to 2007 the 
minimum percentage increase rate was 
the greater of 102 percent of the MA 
capitation rate for the preceding year or 
the MA capitation rate for the preceding 
year increased by the national per capita 
MA growth percentage for the year. 
Since the statute, as revised by the 
DRA, no longer provides for the 2 
percent minimum update, we can no 
longer apply it to the MA rates. The 2 
percent minimum update still applies to 
the end stage renal disease MA update 
because the statute at section 
1853(a)(1)(H) of the Act provides that 
ESRD rates are to be calculated in a 
manner consistent with the way those 
rates were calculated ‘‘under the 
provisions of [section 1853 of the Act] 
as in effect before the date of enactment 
of the MMA.’’ The pre-2003 version of 
section 1853 of the Act included the 2 
percent minimum update. Therefore, we 
propose to revise § 422.306 to eliminate 
the 2 percent minimum update for all 
rate calculations other than ESRD. 
E. Changes To Improve Data Collection 
for Oversight and Quality Assessment 
This section of the rule outlines four 
proposals related to improving Part C 
and D data collection for oversight and 
quality assessment. The first proposal 
addresses quality improvement projects 
and data on quality and outcomes 
measures under Part C. As part of this 
proposal, we would use data collected 
by Quality Improvement Organizations 
for MA quality improvement and 
performance assessment purposes. 
The second proposal addresses 
payment for beneficiary surveys. We 
would require, consistent with other 
surveys under the MA program that MA 
and Part D sponsoring organizations pay 
for the data collection costs of the 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) annual 
survey beginning in 2011. 
Under our third proposal, we propose 
to require that each Part C and Part D 
sponsor be subject to an independent 
yearly audit of Part C and Part D 
measures (collected pursuant to our 
reporting requirements) to determine 
their reliability, validity, completeness, 
and comparability in accordance with 
specifications developed by us. 
Finally, the last proposal would 
amend our rules on the collection and 
use of prescription drug event data for 
nonpayment-related purposes. 
Previously our rules addressed only the 
collection of the original 37 data 
elements for non-payment related 
purposes. In this rule, we are proposing 
to collect all data elements included on 
the drug event record for non-payment 
purposes. We also propose to provide 
for the limited release of plan identifiers 
to certain government grantees. 
For the reasons set forth below, we 
believe each of these proposals is 
necessary to ensure continued quality 
improvement in the Part C and D 
programs.

1. Requirements for Quality 
Improvement Programs Under Part C 
(§ 422.152, § 422.153, and § 480.140) 
Section 1851(d)(4)(D) of the Act 
requires us to make available to MA 
eligible individuals’ information 
comparing MA plan options, including 
information on plan quality and 
performance indicators to the extent this 
information is available. Separately, 
section 1852(e)(1) of the Act requires 
that each MA organization have an 
ongoing quality improvement program 
for the purpose of improving the quality 
of care provided to enrollees in each 
MA plan offered by the MA 
organization. Section 1852(e)(3)(A) of 
the Act requires that, as part of this 
quality improvement program, MA 
organizations collect, analyze, and 
report data that permits the 
measurement of health outcomes and 
other indices of quality as part of their 
quality improvement program for their 
coordinated care plans. To the extent 
that local PPO, regional PPO, PFFS, and 
MSA plans have a network of contracted 
providers, these plan types must meet 
the same quality improvement 
requirements as other coordinated care 
plans. 
Section 1852(e)(3)(B)(i) of the Act 
generally limits the collection of data on 
quality, outcomes, and beneficiary 
satisfaction under section 1852(e)(3)(A) 
to facilitate consumer choice and 
program administration to ‘‘the types of 
data’’ that were collected as of 
November 1, 2003, however, section 
1852(e)(3)(B)(ii), titled ‘‘Changes in 
Types of Data,’’ provides for the 
Secretary to ‘‘change the types of data 
that are required to be submitted under 
subparagraph (A) after submitting to 
Congress a report on the reasons for 
such changes that was prepared in 
consultation with MA organizations and 
private accrediting bodies.’’ Section 
1852(e)(3)(B)(iii) also makes clear that 
the limitation in section 1852(e)(3)(B)(i) 
shall not be construed as ‘‘restricting the 
ability of the Secretary to carry out the 
duties under section 1851(d)(4)(D)’’ to 
provide beneficiaries with ‘‘available’’ 
quality information on MA plans. 
a. Quality Improvement Programs 
The requirement for MA organizations 
to have ongoing quality improvement 
programs is codified at § 422.152(a). 
Under § 422.152(a)(1), MA plans are 
required to include a chronic care 
improvement program (CCIP) as part of 
their quality improvement program that 
meets the requirements set forth in 
§ 422.152(c). As specified under 
§ 422.152(a)(2), MA organizations are 
also required to include quality 
improvement projects as part of their 
quality improvement program that are 
expected to have a favorable effect on 
enrollee health outcomes and enrollee 
satisfaction, and meet requirements 
established in § 422.152(d). Under our 
current regulations at § 422.152(c) and 
§ 422.152(d), MA organizations have 
flexibility to develop criteria for CCIPs 
and initiate any quality improvement 
project that focuses on clinical and non- 
clinical areas based on the needs of their 
enrolled population. 
Based on our continued experience 
with the MA program and due to 
inconsistent methods used across 
organizations, we are concerned that 
relying on MA organizations to establish 
their own CCIPs and quality 
improvement projects may not lend 
itself to effectively compare plans by 
beneficiaries and to manage and report 
projects. More importantly, we have 
concerns that these projects are not 
addressing quality improvement areas 
that we believe reflect beneficiary 
needs. For example, some projects may 
be designed to improve processes only 
without linking the processes to clinical 
outcomes. For example, improving the 
timeliness and effectiveness of referrals 
to specialists, as measured by process 
measures, may have little or no impact 
on improved health outcomes for 
beneficiaries. We are interested in MA 
organizations focusing on individual as 
well as population specific health risk 
needs (for example, MA organizations’ 
use of data sources internal to their 
organizations to identify clinical 
outcomes that not only fail to meet 
national averages, but also jeopardize 
the overall health and quality of life of 
the beneficiary). 
As a result of our concerns, we are 
proposing to revise § 422.152(a)(1) and 
§ 422.152(a)(2) to require that MA 
organizations conduct CCIPs in patient 
populations and quality improvement 
projects in areas identified by CMS 
based on our review of data collected 
from MA organizations and the 
population served by the plans. We 
propose to determine what areas would 
most benefit from quality improvement 
and will provide guidance on specific 
quality improvement projects for MA 
organizations to implement, either 
based on that organization’s specific 
quality improvement needs, or quality 
improvement needs for MA plans 
generally. We also will suggest methods 
and processes by which to manage a 
quality improvement project as 
appropriate. 
Using the HPMS, Medicare Managed 
Care Manual, and other means of 
communication that CMS determines to 
be appropriate, we will annually inform 
MA organizations individually and/or 
generally which patient populations and 
areas we have determined would benefit 
most from a CCIP and quality 
improvement project, respectively. 
b. New Quality Measures 
As we strengthen our oversight of 
quality improvement programs 
implemented by MA organizations, we 
believe that there is also a need for us 
to collect additional data on quality and 
outcomes measures in order to better 
track plan performance. We currently 
collect from MA organizations data on 
quality, outcomes, and beneficiary 
satisfaction under Healthcare 
Effectiveness Data and Information Set 
(HEDIS®), Health Outcome Survey 
(HOS), and Consumer Assessment 
Health Providers Survey (CAHPS®). We 
anticipate additional collection and 
reporting of the same types of data on 
health outcomes and quality measures

54681 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
that we currently collect as part of these 
processes. 
We believe that the collection of these 
data is consistent with our authority 
under section 1852(e)(3)(A) of the Act, 
and do not believe that the limitation 
described under section 1852(e)(3)(B) of 
the Act limits this proposed additional 
data collection because the data 
collected would be of the same ‘‘type’’ 
of data that we currently collect as part 
of the HEDIS®, HOS, and CAHPS® 
processes. Examples of additional areas 
on which we plan to collect data are 
post-surgical infections or patient falls. 
Therefore, we are proposing to modify 
§ 422.152(b)(3) and § 422.152(e)(2) to 
require MA plans to collect, analyze, 
and report quality performance data 
identified by CMS that are of the same 
type of data that plans are currently 
required to collect and report to CMS. 
Consistent with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act, we will provide the 
public at least two opportunities for 
public comment before imposing 
additional quality-related collection and 
reporting requirements. 
c. Use of Quality Improvement 
Organization Review Information 
The mission of the Quality 
Improvement Organization Program, as 
authorized under section 1862(g) and 
Part B of title XI of the Act, is to 
improve the effectiveness, efficiency, 
economy, and quality of services 
delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. We 
contract with one organization in each 
state, as well as the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
to serve as that state/jurisdiction’s 
Quality Improvement Organization 
(QIO) contractor. QIOs are private, 
mostly not-for-profit organizations, 
which are staffed by professionals, 
mostly doctors and other health care 
professionals, who are trained to review 
medical care and help beneficiaries with 
complaints about the quality of care and 
to implement improvements in the 
quality of care available throughout the 
spectrum of care. Over time, QIOs have 
been instrumental in advancing national 
efforts to motivate providers in 
improving the quality of Medicare 
services, and in measuring and 
improving outcomes of quality. 
Data collected by QIOs to accomplish 
their mission represent an important 
tool for CMS in our efforts to improve 
quality under the MA program. QIOs 
collect survey, administrative, and 
medical records data in order to monitor 
and assess provider performance. These 
data are frequently required by scope of 
work contracts administered by CMS to 
assess whether or not QIOs are meeting 
performance goals. 
Certain QIO data could be used to 
develop a standardized core set of 
clinical and non-clinical quality and 
performance measures that could be 
applied to all MA plans in order to 
allow beneficiaries to make better 
comparisons across all MA plan types 
and make an informed decision when 
selecting a plan. These measures could 
be used to rate plans according to their 
performance. To support efforts to 
provide meaningful information to 
beneficiaries when selecting an MA 
plan, we also plan to develop minimum 
performance levels and requirements 
that address clinical and non-clinical 
areas. In addition to tracking plan 
performance, these data could also be 
used to ensure plan compliance with 
MA contract requirements and support 
compliance or enforcement actions 
against plans that are poor performers 
on certain quality and performance 
measures. These data would also allow 
us to create a competitive value-based 
purchasing program based on quality of 
care. 
Therefore, we plan to use one 
particular type of information already 
collected by QIOs and retool the data 
elements to make them specific to 
beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans. This 
information is quality review study 
(QRS) information, which is defined in 
42 CFR 480.101(b). A QRS is ‘‘an 
assessment, conducted by or for a QIO, 
of a patient care problem for the 
purpose of improving patient care 
through peer analysis, intervention, 
resolution of the problem and follow- 
up.’’ QRS information means all 
documentation related to the QRS 
process. We intend to collect from the 
QIO only the data that relates to MA 
plan beneficiaries, providers, 
practitioners, and services. We could 
then aggregate the data to the applicable 
MA plan based on beneficiary 
enrollment. Accordingly, we are 
proposing to add a new § 422.153 to 
indicate that we will collect from the 
QIOs and use quality review study 
information that is generated, collected, 
or acquired by QIOs under part 42 CFR 
480. We intend to use these data for the 
following functions: Enabling 
beneficiaries to compare health coverage 
options and select among them, 
measuring performance under the plan, 
ensuring compliance with plan 
requirements under Part 422, and other 
purposes related specifically to MA 
plans, as specified by CMS. We will not 
disclose any beneficiary identifiable 
information. In addition, we are 
proposing to amend § 480.140 to add a 
new paragraph (g), authorizing CMS’s 
use of quality review study information 
solely for the purposes specified in 
§ 422.153. 
2. CAHPS Survey Administration Under 
Parts C and D (§ 417.472, § 422.152, and 
§ 423.156) 
In accordance with the 1997 Balanced 
Budget Act mandate to collect quality 
assessment data about health plans, we 
began collecting data in 1998 for the 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey 
of enrollees in Medicare Advantage 
(MA) plans (then called 
Medicare+Choice plans). In addition, 
cost contractors under section 1876 of 
the Act have also been participating in 
the CAHPS survey process with respect 
to their enrollees. We have continued to 
conduct this annual CAHPS survey at 
no cost to MA organizations or section 
1876 cost contractors. After passage of 
the Medicare Modernization Act 
(MMA), we began administering a Part 
D version of this survey in 2007 to 
Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and 
Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug 
Plans (MA–PDs) in accordance with 
§ 423.156 and § 422.152. 
Under sections 1857(e) (1) and 
1860D–12 of the Act, the Secretary may 
add additional terms to the contracts 
with MA organizations and Part D 
sponsors as deemed necessary and 
appropriate. Similarly, in the case of 
cost contracts under section 1876, such 
new contract terms may be added under 
section 1876(i)(3)(D). As explained 
below, we are proposing on the basis of 
this authority, that MA, Part D, and 
section 1876 cost contracts will be 
amended to require MA organizations, 
Part D sponsors, and cost contractors to 
pay for the data collection costs of the 
annual CAHPS survey beginning in 
2011. 
In the 2010 Call Letter to Part C and 
D sponsoring organizations, we 
indicated that all MA and Part D 
contracts with at least 600 enrollees as 
of July 1 of the prior calendar year 
would be required to pay for the data 
collection costs of the CAHPS survey 
starting with the administration of the 
2011 annual CAHPS survey. This 
proposal is intended to codify this 
requirement in the Part C and Part D 
regulations at § 423.156 and § 422.152, 
and for cost contractors in § 417.472. 
The proposal to require MA 
organizations, Part D sponsors, and 
section 1876 cost contractors to pay for 
the data collection costs of the CAHPS 
survey would apply only to contracts 
with 600 or more enrollees. For reasons 
of statistical precision, a target 
minimum of 300 or more completed 
Medicare CAHPS Surveys must be 
received for each contract. In order to 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 15:14 Oct 21, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22OCP2.SGM 22OCP2dc

obtain 300 or more completed surveys, 
we believe plans must have 600 or more 
enrollees because some enrollees will 
not be eligible to receive the survey, 
such as institutionalized enrollees, and 
not all enrollees selected to be surveyed 
will respond to the survey. 
It is important to note that we conduct 
other Medicare quality surveys, such as 
the Hospital CAHPS and the Medicare 
Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) for 
which the MAOs are responsible for the 
cost of the data collection. This model 
for data collection is standard industry 
practice. For example, FEHB plans pay 
for the administration of the CAHPS 
survey to their members. The data 
collection model that we are proposing 
for CAHPS survey process would use 
the same model that MAOs currently 
follow for HOS. The National 
Committee for Quality Assurance 
(NCQA) certifies vendors to conduct the 
HOS survey on behalf of CMS. In 2009, 
MAOs chose from a list of six approved 
vendors for HOS. We have been moving 
toward this model for all of our data 
collection efforts for beneficiary 
satisfaction surveys. We propose to use 
a similar model for the Medicare 
CAHPS survey where Part C & D 
contractors and section 1876 cost 
contractors would select a vendor from 
a CMS list of approved vendors to 
conduct the survey on their behalf. 
While this proposal would shift the 
cost of data collection to the eligible 
Part C and D contractors for the 
Medicare CAHPS survey (section 1876 
cost contractors would be able to claim 
these costs on their cost reports), with 
this change the sponsoring 
organizations will have the flexibility of 
adding their own questions to the 
Medicare CAHPS survey. The flexibility 
to add questions will allow them to get 
feedback about any contract specific 
issues. 
Under this proposal, the following 
types of contracts would be amended to 
include a requirement to administer the 
CAHPS survey— 
• All Coordinated Care contracts, 
including local and regional preferred 
provider organizations (PPOs) and 
contracts with exclusively Special 
Needs Plans (SNPs) benefit packages; 
• Cost contracts under section 1876 of 
the Act; 
• Private-Fee-For Service (PFFS) and 
Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) 
contracts; and 
• Prescription Drug Plans contracts 
(PDPs). 
All plans under Programs of All 
Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), 
HCPP—1833 cost plans, and employer/ 
union only (PDP and PFFS) contracts 
are excluded from this CAHPS 
administration. 
Under this proposal, the first survey 
using the new model of data collection 
would be conducted in early 2011. 
Contracts that were in effect on or before 
January 1, 2010, would use the number 
of enrollees in a plan as of July 1, 2010 
to determine whether they are required 
to conduct the 2011 CAHPS survey. In 
late 2010, all MA and Part D contracts 
that are subject to the CAHPS survey 
requirement in 2011 would need to 
select an approved Medicare CAHPS 
survey vendor to administer the survey. 
We note that, in addition to approving 
a list of survey vendors to conduct the 
survey on behalf of all MA and Part D 
contracts, we would select the sample of 
enrollees to be surveyed for each 
contract, approve survey vendors, 
provide oversight of survey vendor 
activities, analyze the CAHPS data for 
plan ratings, and produce individual- 
level reports for quality improvement 
use by MA and Part D contracts. 
Vendors will be trained by us to collect 
and submit data within specified 
timeframes. If we decide to implement 
this proposal, we will provide further 
information regarding access to the 
listing of approved vendors for the 
CAHPS survey. 
3. Validation of Part C and Part D 
Reporting Requirements (§ 422.516 and 
§ 423.514) 
Under sections 1857(e) and 1860D–12 
of the Act, we have the authority to 
establish information collection 
requirements with respect to MA 
organizations and Part D sponsors. 
Under section 1857(e)(1) of the Act, MA 
organizations are required to provide 
the Secretary with such information as 
the Secretary may find necessary and 
appropriate. Section 1857(e)(1) of the 
Act applies to PDPs as indicated in 
section 1860D–12. Pursuant to our 
statutory authority, we codified these 
information collection requirements in 
regulation at § 422.516 and § 423.514, 
respectively. 
Consistent with our regulatory 
authority to collect information, we 
developed specific MA and Part D 
reporting requirements to assist in 
monitoring the Part C and D programs 
and to respond to questions from 
Congress, oversight agencies, and the 
public. These inquiries include 
questions about costs, availability of 
services, beneficiary use of available 
services, patient safety, grievance rates, 
and other factors pertaining to MAOs 
and PDPs. We began collecting Part D 
information at the inception of the 
program. Data collected under the Part 
D reporting requirements currently 
include seventeen measures ranging 
from access to extended day supplies at 
retail pharmacies to drug benefit 
analyses. Over time, we have modified 
the data elements collected as we gained 
more experience with the program. The 
current Part D reporting requirements 
(OMB 0938–0992) may be accessed at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/08_
RxContracting_ReportingOversight.asp. 
We also require routine reporting of 
specific data elements by MA 
organizations. Beginning in January 
2009, MA organizations are required to 
report information across 13 measures 
ranging from benefit utilization to agent 
training and testing. Similar to the Part 
D reporting requirements, these 
measures are designed to enable us to 
monitor plan performance and to 
respond to inquiries. The current Part C 
reporting requirements (OMB 0938– 
1054) may be accessed at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/HealthPlansGenInfo/ 
16_ReportingRequirements.asp. 
In order for us to use the data 
provided by MA organizations and PDP 
sponsors, the data must be accurate, 
valid, reliable, and comparable across 
plans. Because we have received data of 
questionable validity from some Part D 
sponsors, we stated in the 2010 Call 
letter (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
prescriptiondrugcovcontra) that the 
agency ‘‘has received many inquiries 
from Congress, oversight agencies, and 
the public about costs, availability of 
services, beneficiary use of available 
services, patient safety, grievance rates, 
and other factors pertaining to MAOs 
and PDPs. However, to date, we have 
not been able to address many of these 
inquiries due to either an absence of 
data with respect to MAOs or, despite 
collecting over three years’ worth of 
data, data of questionable validity 
submitted by Part D sponsors.’’ 
Accordingly, to meet the goals of data 
validity reliability, and comparability, 
we indicated in the Call Letter that, ‘‘to 
better enable CMS to respond to 
inquiries and manage our programs, 
sponsoring organizations should 
undertake a data validation audit on 
reported Part C and Part D data effective 
for CY2010.’’ Given the importance of 
the new Part C and Part D data reporting 
requirements, we are proposing to 
require MAOs and Part D sponsors to 
undertake an independent data 
validation audit in accordance with 
CMS specifications on reported Part C 
and Part D data that would be effective 
for CY2011. We believe that only an 
independent data validation audit 
conducted by an external entity under 
contract to the MAO or PDP sponsoring 
organization would ensure that the

results of the audit are in accordance 
with CMS specifications, that data used 
to develop plan performance measures 
are credible to other stakeholders, and 
that information used to respond to 
Congressional and public inquiries are 
reliable. We therefore propose to amend 
§ 422.516 and § 423.514 to state that 
each Part C and Part D sponsor be 
subject to an independent yearly audit 
of Part C and Part D measures (collected 
pursuant to our reporting requirements) 
to determine their reliability, validity, 
completeness, and comparability in 
accordance with specifications 
developed by CMS. 
We note that we are working with a 
contractor to develop data validation 
specifications to ensure that the goals of 
reliability, validity, completeness, and 
comparability are met at the conclusion 
of the data validation audit. These 
specifications will focus on how 
organizations and sponsors compile 
numerators and denominators, take into 
account appropriate data exclusions, 
and verify calculations, computer code, 
and algorithms. In addition, they will be 
used to inform how the MAOs, cost 
plans, and Part D sponsors collect, store, 
and report data. We expect that these 
specifications will be utilized by the 
auditors hired by MAOs and Part D 
sponsors to conduct the data validation 
audits, the results of which will be 
forwarded to us. We expect to make 
these specifications available on our 
website for public comment early next 
year. We solicit comment on this 
approach. 
4. Collection of Additional Part D 
Claims’ Elements for Nonpayment- 
Related Purposes (§ 423.505) 
Section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act, 
which incorporates section 1857(e) of 
the Act provides the Secretary with 
authority to include in Part D sponsor 
contracts any terms or conditions the 
Secretary deems necessary and 
appropriate, including requiring the 
organization to provide the Secretary 
with such information as the Secretary 
may find necessary and appropriate. 
Under this authority, on May 28, 2008 
we published a final rule that allowed 
the Secretary to collect Part D ‘‘claims’’ 
data from the prescription drug event 
(PDE) record and use the information 
gathered for non-payment purposes (73 
FR 30664). However, this rule limited 
what data (hereinafter referred to as PDE 
elements) we may collect and use for 
non-payment purposes. The rule also 
described circumstances under which 
we may disclose the data to other 
government and external entities, and 
the limitations associated with any such 
release. 
In 2006 and 2007 there were 37 PDE 
elements. In 2008 the number of PDE 
elements collected was expanded from 
the original 37 elements to 39 elements. 
The additional PDE elements are 
‘‘Estimated Rebate Amount Applied to 
the Point-of-Sale Price’’ and ‘‘Vaccine 
Administration Fee.’’ The ‘‘Estimated 
Rebate Amount applied to the Point-of- 
Sale Price’’ is the estimated amount of 
a rebate that the plan sponsor has 
elected to apply to the negotiated price 
as a reduction in the drug price made 
available to the beneficiary at the point 
of sale. The ‘‘Vaccine Administration 
Fee’’ is the amount that is charged for 
the administration of a vaccine separate 
from the actual vaccine. 
In the 2010 Call Letter to sponsoring 
organizations we noted that we were 
planning to add a new (40th) element to 
the PDE record, referred to as the 
‘‘Prescription Origin Code.’’ (at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/ 
CallLetter.pdf). The prescription origin 
code is designed to capture the 
frequency with which providers use e- 
prescribing. 
The original Part D claims data 
proposed rule published on October 18, 
2006 (71 FR 61447) did not address the 
collection, for purposes other than 
payment, of any additional elements 
that might be added to the original 37 
elements. Rather, in the proposed rule, 
we only included a discussion of the 37 
elements that then comprised the PDE 
record and proposed that we would 
collect these 37 PDE elements under 
section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act. As 
a result, as noted in the May 28, 2008 
final rule (73 FR 30667) on Part D 
claims data, interested parties were not 
afforded an opportunity to comment on 
whether new elements that were added 
to the PDE record for 2008 (or any PDE 
elements that might be added in the 
future) should be collected under 
section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act, 
and, consequently, used or disclosed to 
other parties for non-payment related 
purposes. 
In this rule, we are now proposing to 
collect all additional PDE elements 
beyond the original 37 elements under 
the same authority described in the May 
28, 2008 final rule on Part D claims data 
(that is, section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the 
Act). As a result, we would be able to 
use these data for non-payment related 
purposes. Similarly, under this 
proposal, we would be able to release 
these elements to governmental and 
external entities, under the authority of 
section 1106 of the Act, using the same 
process that we now use to release the 
original 37 elements as described in the 
May 28, 2008 final rule, and as updated 
by the September 18, 2008 interim final 
rule that incorporated changes made as 
a result of section 181 of MIPPA. Thus, 
in this rule, we propose that the release 
of any additional PDE data elements 
collected using our authority under 
section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act 
would continue to be subject to our 
minimum necessary data policy, our 
data sharing procedures, and the 
encryption of certain identifiers and 
aggregation of cost data to protect 
beneficiary confidentiality and 
commercially sensitive data of Part D 
sponsors. 
This proposal would allow us to 
collect and use for non-payment-related 
purposes any data obtained as a result 
of the addition of new elements to the 
PDE record without undertaking 
rulemaking for each additional element 
added in the future. We believe that the 
May 28, 2008 of Part D Claims Data final 
rule (73 FR 30664) resolved any 
statutory ambiguity surrounding our 
broad authority to collect PDE data 
under section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the 
Act. Accordingly, we may use this same 
authority to collect additional elements 
that have been added to the PDE since 
2007. Once data have been collected 
under section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the 
Act, we may use these data for non- 
payment related purposes and may 
release PDE data consistent with our 
minimum necessary policy and our data 
procedures. 
Elements such as rebates applied at 
the point-of-sale, vaccine 
administration, and prescription origin 
code represent claim-level information 
that once accessed and analyzed, could 
provide useful insight into operations of 
the Part D prescription drug benefit 
program. For example the prescription 
origin code could be studied to identify 
how often electronic prescribing is used 
in practice, and serve as background for 
policy proposals to further support this 
practice in the industry. Accordingly, 
we believe it is appropriate that these 
elements should be collected under 
section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act. 
For the same reason, we believe it 
would be appropriate to use our 
authority under section 1860D– 
12(b)(3)(D) of the Act to collect for non- 
payment purposes all elements that may 
be added to the PDE record in the 
future. We believe that the ability to 
analyze new claims-related elements 
added to the PDE record would increase 
both specific and general knowledge of 
Medicare beneficiaries’ healthcare and 
the operation of the Part D program and 
would aid our ability to conduct 
program oversight, support operational 
tasks, and provide more information for 
use in internal and external healthcare

research studies. Moreover, we would 
not be required to undertake a separate 
rulemaking and public comment 
process each time new elements are 
added to the PDE record, but rather 
would automatically begin collecting for 
non-payment purposes elements added 
to the PDE record using our authority 
under section 1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the 
Act and § 423.505(f)(3) of the 
regulations. As a result, we would have 
the ability to analyze these data for 
nonpayment related purposes in order 
to identify operational problems or to 
support future policy proposals without 
delay. Moreover, because we do not 
propose to modify our data sharing 
processes or our minimum necessary 
data policy with this proposal, any 
release of these new elements would be 
subject to the same protections that 
currently apply to all other Part D PDE 
data. Thus, we will continue to— 
• Ensure that beneficiary, prescriber, 
or pharmacy identifiers are not released 
unless absolutely necessary for a project 
(for example, to link to another 
database); 
• Encrypt Part D plan identifiers and 
aggregate cost data elements (ingredient 
cost, dispensing fee, and sales tax) when 
sharing PDE data with external 
requesters; and 
• Subject each request to our data 
sharing procedures which includes 
ensuring that requestors have the 
appropriate experience and are working 
for, or on behalf of, a reputable 
institution and that, when appropriate, 
make their project results public. 
External requests concerning beneficiary 
identifiable data would continue to be 
reviewed by the CMS Privacy Board, 
and would require the requestor to sign 
a data use agreement. 
Accordingly, for the aforementioned 
reasons, we are proposing to amend 
§ 423.505(f)(3) to include all data 
elements included in all drug claims for 
purposes deemed necessary and 
appropriate by the Secretary and 
consistent with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. 
In the May 28, 2008 final rule we 
deemed it necessary to protect various 
Part D elements when responding to 
external research requests (as discussed 
above). Accordingly, beneficiary ID, 
plan ID, prescriber ID, and pharmacy ID 
are encrypted prior to release to external 
entities. However, in the case of 
beneficiary ID, prescriber ID, and 
pharmacy ID, this information may be 
provided in an unencrypted format 
when needed to link to another data set. 
In contrast, under the current rule, there 
is no exception to the requirement that 
plan identifiers be encrypted for all 
external research requests. Under the 
current regulation, grantees of HHS 
agencies are treated as external entities 
and may not access plan identifiers. In 
contrast, contractors acting on behalf of 
HHS are not considered to be external 
entities and may receive unencrypted 
plan identifiers when necessary for a 
particular project, due to the provision 
in § 423.505(m)(iii)(A) that ‘‘all elements 
on the claim are available to HHS.’’ 
Subsequent to publication of the Part 
D data rule, we have been made aware 
by some HHS agencies that a number of 
their grantees are having difficulty 
conducting some studies without a Plan 
ID (for example, studies which examine 
the extent to which plan choice is 
influenced by a plan’s name could only 
be determined using actual plan 
identifiers). These concerns have arisen 
at time when healthcare costs and 
patient outcomes under existing 
healthcare delivery systems are under 
great scrutiny, necessitating more 
research on cost-effective alternatives 
for healthcare delivery. 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 423.505(m)(iii)(C) to permit CMS 
disclosure to HHS grantees of 
unencrypted plan identifiers when 
certain conditions are met. We believe 
these conditions will mitigate the risk of 
any unauthorized use or disclosure of 
commercially sensitive plan 
information. The conditions we propose 
be met include— 
• The plan identifier is essential to 
the study and there is no other source 
of CMS data that would substitute for 
plan identifiers in order to carry out the 
study; 
• The study is key to the mission of 
the sponsoring agency; 
• The study provides significant 
benefit to the Medicare program; and 
• The requestor attests that any 
public findings or publications will not 
identify plans or plan sponsors. 
In evaluating requestors’ proposals to 
determine whether these conditions are 
met, we propose the following 
evaluation standards: 
• Plan identifier, to evaluate the 
requestor’s rationale to determine 
whether an encrypted plan identifier 
would be sufficient for the study design 
or if the real identifier is necessary for 
the study. 
• Agency mission, we propose to 
review the requestor’s agency’s rationale 
for the study and how the study would 
help the agency achieve its mission. 
• Medicare program benefit, we 
propose to review the requestor’s 
rationale for the importance of study 
findings to the Medicare program. 
• Public reporting, we propose to 
require an attestation from the requestor 
that the requestor will not identify 
specific plans or plan sponsors in any 
public reporting. 
We are proposing to provide access to 
unencrypted plan identifiers to HHS 
grantees for several reasons. First, some 
HHS agencies accomplish their mission 
through grants, rather than contracts, 
and hence cannot rely on the access that 
is provided to HHS contractors, which 
means that HHS agencies have 
differential access to prescription drug 
event data. In addition, we believe that 
research performed by HHS grantees 
will advance the interests of Medicare 
beneficiaries, who may also be served 
by other HHS programs. A number of 
HHS agencies, such as the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the 
Agency for Health Care Research and 
Quality (AHRQ), provide grants for 
research on topics such as the 
utilization, adherence, safety, and 
effectiveness of medications in the 
elderly and disabled populations which 
are of key interest to the Medicare 
program. We anticipate that such 
studies will assist health care providers 
in improving medication use in 
Medicare beneficiaries over time. 
Although our proposal is limited to 
HHS grantees, we also request 
comments on whether it would be 
appropriate to extend this proposal to 
permit grantees of other Federal 
agencies to have access to plan 
identifiers when this access may be 
necessary for a particular research 
project and that project otherwise meets 
the conditions described above. 
F. Changes To Implement New Policy 
This section addresses two policy 
proposals. In the area of Part D 
formulary policy, we propose new 
regulatory requirements affecting the 
inclusion of protected drug categories 
and classes on Part D formularies, 
following the enactment of MIPPA, 
which made a number of changes to the 
Part C and D programs., Under Part C, 
we propose to revise our rules to allow 
beneficiaries who elect MSAs as a type 
of health insurance plan to pay only a 
pro-rated deductible if their MSA 
deposit is pro-rated because they enroll 
after January 1. These revisions are 
detailed in Table 6.

1. Protected Classes of Concern Under 
Part D (§ 423.120(b)(2)(v)) 
As noted previously, the MIPPA was 
enacted on July 15, 2008. Prior to the 
passage of MIPPA and before the start of 
the program, we directed Part D 
sponsors to include on their formularies 
all or substantially all drugs in six drug 
categories (that is, antidepressant; 
antipsychotic; anticonvulsant; 
immunosuppressant for transplant 
rejection; antiretroviral; and 
antineoplastic categories or classes). 
This directive was aimed at ensuring a 
smooth transition of the approximately 
6 million dual eligible beneficiaries who 
were converting from Medicaid drug 
coverage to Medicare drug coverage at 
the start of the Part D program. 
Although section 1860D–11(i) of the Act 
prohibits us from establishing a 
‘‘national formulary,’’ we have 
interpreted our obligation under section 
1860D–11(e)(2)(D)(i) of the Act not to 
approve discriminatory benefit designs 
as providing the authority to set 
standards for review of formularies. In 
developing our formulary policy, we 
have sought to build on a careful 
balance between ensuring access to 
drugs for vulnerable populations, while 
at the same time allowing Part D 
sponsors the ability to implement drug 
utilization management processes to 
achieve cost containment. These 
standards are contained in Chapter 6 of 
the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual located at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/downloads/ 
R2PDBv2.pdf. 
Section 176 of MIPPA added a new 
section 1860D–4(b)(3)(G)(i) to the Act 
requiring, effective plan year 2010, that 
the Secretary establish certain categories 
or classes of drugs that meet two 
specific statutory specifications: (1) 
Restricted access to the drugs in the 
category or class would have major or 
life threatening clinical consequences 
for individuals who have a disease or 
disorder treated by drugs in such 
category or class; and (2) There is a 
significant need for such individuals to 
have access to multiple drugs within a 
category or class due to unique chemical 
actions and pharmacological effects of 
the drugs within a category or class. In 
addition, the MIPPA provides the 
Secretary with the discretion to 
establish exceptions permitting Part D 
sponsors to exclude from their 
formularies, or to otherwise limit access 
to (including utilization management 
restrictions or prior authorization), 
certain Part D drugs from the protected 
categories and classes. 
In the January 16, 2009 Federal 
Register (74 FR 2881), we published the 
Medicare Advantage and Prescription 
Drug Programs MIPPA Drug Formulary 
and Protected Classes Policies interim 
final rule with comment period that 
revised the regulations governing the 
Medicare Part D formularies as a result 
of MIPPA. We codified the MIPPA 
provision requiring the inclusion of all 
drugs from identified ‘‘protected 
categories and classes’’ on Part D 
sponsor formularies at 
§ 423.120(b)(2)(v). We also noted in the 
preamble of the January 16, 2009 IFC 
that the timing of Part D formulary 
submissions for 2010 will preclude us 
from making identification in time for 
the 2010 contract year. As such, we 
noted that Part D sponsors must 
continue to provide coverage of the six 
classes of clinical concern in contract 
year 2010, consistent with the policy 
already in place since 2005. For contract 
years 2011 and subsequent contract 
years, we indicated in the preamble that 
we plan to conduct a comprehensive 
analysis to— 
• Determine which categories and 
classes of drugs, including which 
existing six classes of clinical concern, 
meet the MIPPA requirements for 
protected categories and classes; and 
• Identify any potential exceptions to 
the requirement that all drugs from 
protected categories or classes be 
included on Part D sponsor formularies. 
We also specifically noted in the 
preamble that we are planning a 
multilevel review process to identify 
protected categories and classes that 
would include the following: 
• An initial data-driven analysis of 
widely used treatment guidelines and 
Part D utilization data; and 
• A secondary review by a clinical 
review panel that will serve to validate 
the findings of the initial analysis. 
We also stated that the second-level 
expert panel would be ‘‘consensus 
driven’’ and that ‘‘information regarding 
the independence, potential conflicts of 
interest, expertise, and balance of the 
individuals chosen for this panel would 
be made publicly available.’’ 
We received 30 public comments on 
the January 16, 2009 IFC. Some 
commenters suggested an expansion of 
the current six classes of clinical 
concern policy, either through the 
removal of current exceptions or 
through processes that might broaden 
the number of protected classes beyond 
six. Other commenters suggested that 
the MIPPA was passed in order to 
codify the current six classes of clinical 
concern. Still other commenters 
suggested limiting the protected classes, 
stating that plans and pharmaceutical 
benefit managers can only limit 
beneficiary cost increases through use of 
formulary and drug utilization 
management tools. These commenters 
stated that CMS must carefully weigh 
increased beneficiary costs against any 
additional protections that derive from 
the establishment protected drug 
classes. Several commenters requested 
further clarification of terms, such as 
what we meant by our review of 
‘‘widely used treatment guidelines’’ and 
what is meant by the MIPPA definition 
of ‘‘access to multiple drugs,’’ with 
many suggesting different 
interpretations. Finally, many 
commenters focused on our process 
outlined in the January 2009 IFC, with 
some questioning whether members of 
the validation review panel would be 
solicited from experts outside the 
government under a Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA) process, 
whether the representation would 
include the perspective of beneficiaries, 
especially groups that advocate for 
beneficiaries living with specific 
diseases prevalent among Medicare 
beneficiaries, and whether the panel 
would include practicing physicians 
and specialists with documented

experience in treating Medicare patients 
in the therapeutic areas under review. 
Based on the comments received on 
the January 16, 2009 IFC, we have 
decided to revisit section 176 of MIPPA 
and the ‘‘protected classes’’ for further 
interpretation and review. While some 
commenters and a few outside parties 
have suggested that the Congress’ 
intention behind section 176 of MIPPA 
was to codify our preexisting ‘‘6 class’’ 
policy, we do not believe that the plain 
reading of the statute supports such an 
interpretation because the six classes are 
not expressly identified in the MIPPA. 
Rather, we continue to believe that 
various analyses are needed to 
determine which drug classes meet the 
MIPPA criteria. Furthermore, varied and 
conflicting public comments we 
received on the January 16, 2009 IFC 
persuade us that the MIPPA criteria are 
not self implementing and, moreover, 
the process envisioned in the January 
16, 2009 IFC may be unduly 
burdensome and too unwieldy to permit 
timely changes in reaction to medical 
and pharmacological advances. As a 
result, we are engaging in notice and 
comment rulemaking to further interpret 
section 176 of MIPPA. 
We believe that the critical policy 
decision at hand, based on the 
comments received, is how broadly or 
narrowly we interpret specific terms in 
the MIPPA provisions. Interpreted 
broadly, the provisions in section 176 of 
MIPPA might easily encompass many 
classes of drugs and significantly 
increase costs to the Part D program by 
eliminating the need for manufacturers 
to aggressively rebate their products for 
formulary placement. However, a 
narrow interpretation of these criteria 
would reduce the number of classes that 
are ‘‘protected’’. 
We believe that the plain reading of 
section 176 of MIPPA does not remove 
or otherwise revise our transition and 
coverage determination protections 
outlined in subparts C and M of part 
423, and further explained in Chapters 
6 and 18 of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PrescriptionDrugCovContra/ 
12_PartDManuals.asp#TopOfPage. 
These existing protections require Part 
D sponsors to establish a transition 
process, consistent with our 
requirements (which we propose to 
codify elsewhere in this rule), for issues 
associated with coverage of non- 
formulary drugs. They also require a 
Part D sponsor to establish an 
exceptions and appeals process, 
including an expedited request process 
in urgent situations that allows a 
beneficiary the right to request a 
coverage determination for a non- 
formulary Part D drug on the basis of 
medical necessity. Our requirements 
further include the right of review of a 
sponsor’s negative determination by an 
independent review entity in cases of 
both a standard and expedited appeal. 
We believe that it is critically 
important that section 176 of MIPPA be 
read in the context of the other 
protections inherent in the Part D 
program in order to avoid establishing 
unnecessary duplicative protections. 
The current protections already serve as 
an underlying foundation to ensuring 
access to needed Part D drugs that do 
not appear on a Part D plan’s formulary. 
We therefore propose to amend the 
regulatory language at § 423.120(b)(2)(v) 
that was added by the January 16, 2009 
IFC in order to reflect the MIPPA 
protected categories and classes 
provision in the context of these 
protections. Specifically, we are 
proposing to interpret several of the 
statutory terms in section 176 of MIPPA 
to better define the scope of the 
protections under this section of 
MIPPA. To that end, we are proposing 
several new definitions at § 423.100. 
In order to read section 176 of MIPPA 
in the context of the existing Part D 
program, we believe there is a need to 
interpret the meaning of the term 
‘‘restricted access’’ under the first 
MIPPA criterion in section 1860D– 
4(b)(3)(G)(i) of the Act, which refers to 
‘‘restricted access to the drugs in the 
category or class [having] a major or life 
threatening clinical consequences for 
individuals who have a disease or 
disorder treated by drugs in such 
category or class.’’ In theory, lack of 
access to any drug that is medically 
necessary could result in serious or life- 
threatening clinical consequences. 
Thus, one could argue that all 
prescribed Part D drugs are medically 
necessary and therefore should be 
protected. However, we believe that is 
more appropriate to interpret the MIPPA 
criteria more narrowly, both to avoid 
duplicative protections, as mentioned 
above, as well as to preserve one of the 
key aspects of the Part D program— 
namely, that Part D sponsors have the 
ability to undertake cost containment 
efforts through formulary design. For 
this reason, we believe it makes sense to 
interpret the statutory criteria that will 
be used to identify protected categories 
or classes of drugs with these 
parameters in mind, while seeking to 
ensure that the protections afforded 
under section 176 of MIPPA are 
meaningful. Under this interpretation, 
therefore, we intend the criteria to apply 
in those circumstances wherein a short 
time delay that results from the 
application of existing procedures will 
result in the exacerbation of the 
enrollee’s underlying disease to an 
extent that it would cause persistent or 
permanent damage. For example, a short 
delay in access to an 
immunosuppressant to prevent 
transplant rejection would be more 
likely to meet the statutory criteria than 
a short delay in access to a drug 
intended to increase bone density or 
treat hyperlipidemia. 
Given these considerations, we 
believe that in light of existing 
beneficiary protections under Part D, 
‘‘restricted access’’ should be construed 
to occur in the case of someone who, 
but for the protected classes provision, 
urgently requires a Part D drug but is 
waiting for an expedited 
redetermination by a Part D plan or our 
independent review entity with respect 
to coverage of that drug. It is during this 
period of time—where the beneficiary 
may urgently need the drug but does not 
yet have access to it—that is most likely 
to result in a major or life threatening 
clinical consequence for beneficiaries 
who require treatment of a chronic 
condition or disease and who are going 
without such medications while 
awaiting the redetermination. 
Accordingly, we believe that we must 
identify drug classes and categories to, 
in part, address this situation. 
To understand how our proposed 
definition of restricted access fits in 
context with the rest of the first MIPPA 
criterion, we believe it is important to 
have a consistent interpretation of the 
phrase ‘‘major or life threatening 
clinical consequences.’’ In thinking 
about how to define this term, we 
considered a definition developed by 
the FDA for new drug and biological 
products that are being studied for their 
safety and effectiveness in treating life- 
threatening or severely debilitating 
diseases. The definition of life- 
threatening in that context reads as: (1) 
Diseases or conditions where the 
likelihood of death is high unless the 
course of the disease is interrupted; and 
(2) diseases or conditions with 
potentially fatal outcomes, where the 
endpoint of clinical trial analysis is 
survival (21 CFR 312.81(a)). However, 
we concluded that this definition is too 
restrictive for our purposes. Seciton 176 
of MIPPA contemplates ensuring 
enrollee access to drugs where restricted 
access ‘‘would have major or life 
threatening clinical consequences’’ 
(emphasis added). Thus, an 
interpretation that potentially could 
exclude ‘‘major’’ clinical consequences 
that were non-life-threatening would be 
insufficient. Instead, we believe that the 
definition of a similar term, ‘‘serious

reaction,’’ found at World Health 
Organization’s Web site at http:// 
www.who.int/medicines/areas/ 
quality_safety/safety_efficacy/ 
Annex1GlossaryofTerms.pdf is more 
instructive and more appropriate for 
addressing the circumstances in which 
Part D enrollees may face restricted 
access to medically necessary drugs 
without a protected class requirement 
because unlike the FDA definition, it is 
not limited life-threatening situations, 
but rather encompasses both major and 
life-threatening clinical consequences. 
Therefore, we propose to define major 
or life threatening clinical consequences 
in a manner similar to the WHO 
definition. Specifically, we propose to 
define ‘‘major or life threatening clinical 
consequences’’ to mean serious clinical 
events that arise as a result of not taking 
a drug that leads to patient 
hospitalization, or a persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity, or 
that result in death. 
We note that our proposed definitions 
with respect to the first criterion of 
section 176 of MIPPA are intended to 
provide protection against major or life 
threatening consequences at a time 
when other beneficiary protections still 
would result in a delay in access. We 
believe that only categories or classes of 
drugs for which a delay could cause a 
major or life threatening clinical 
consequences based on the definitions 
described above establish the most 
logical standard for the Part D program 
given existing beneficiary protections 
while avoiding potential increased 
program costs associated with adding 
duplicative protections. 
The second MIPPA criterion requires 
that ‘‘[t]here is a significant need for 
such individuals to have access to 
multiple drugs within a category or 
class due to unique chemical actions 
and pharmacological effects of the drugs 
within the category or class, such as 
drugs used in the treatment of cancer.’’ 
To understand how this criterion 
intersects with the first criterion, one 
has to understand the meaning of the 
phrase ‘‘significant need for access to 
multiple drugs.’’ We believe that this 
phrase can be interpreted in only two 
ways: (1) To infer that the statutory 
phrase means simultaneous use of 
multiple drugs; or (2) to infer that the 
phrase means the sequential use of 
drugs due to a significant likelihood of 
failure of a specific drug in a class 
leading to the substitution of another 
drug or drugs in the same class. To 
ensure beneficiary protection, we 
propose to define the term ‘‘significant 
need for access to multiple drugs’’ to 
include both readings. Thus, we 
propose to define the term to mean 
instances in which— 
• There is a need for simultaneous 
use of multiple drugs within a drug 
grouping because such drugs work in 
combination with each other; or 
• There is a strong likelihood of 
sequential use of drugs within a class or 
category within a short period of time 
due to a significant likelihood of failure 
of a specific drug in a class leading to 
the substitution of another drug or drugs 
in the same class. In other words, there 
is a strong likelihood that a different 
drug in the same category or class will 
be needed in a short period of time if 
the first drug failed due to the unique 
effects that the drug type may have on 
an individual. For example, there is a 
strong likelihood that noncurative 
chemotherapy will require multiple 
different drug substitutions as the 
cancer goes in and out of remission. 
Second, with respect to duration, we 
propose that a ‘‘short period of time’’ is 
a short time frame delay that will result 
in exacerbation of underlying disease to 
an extent that persistent and permanent 
damages will occur. 
We propose to define the term 
‘‘multiple drugs’’ to mean two or more 
drugs, and we propose to define the 
phrase ‘‘category or class’’ for purposes 
of determining compliance with the 
rules for protected categories and 
classes of section 176 of MIPPA as the 
identification of a drug grouping that is 
reasonable to identify the applicable 
drug product. We do not believe this 
identification is necessarily tied to a 
specific drug classification system, but 
rather represents the most specific 
grouping that is reasonable to identify 
the applicable drug products. For 
example, it may include drug groupings 
based on the USP Model Guidelines, the 
American Hospital Formulary Service 
(AHFS) classification, another drug 
classification system, or some 
combination thereof to define 
reasonable groupings of drugs. 
Finally, consistent with the statutory 
authority for the Secretary to identify 
exceptions to the provision in section 
176 of MIPPA, we propose to specify 
some of the exceptions to the MIPPA 
provision to include on formulary ‘‘all’’ 
Part D drugs meeting the two conditions 
set forth in section 1860D–4(b)(3)(G)(i) 
of the Act. As we stated in the January 
16, 2009 IFC (74 FR 2881) and in our 
January 28, 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR 
4260), inclusion of ‘‘all covered Part D 
drugs’’ on formulary from a protected 
class or category does not extend to 
inclusion of all brand-name drugs and 
generic versions of the covered drug in 
question. Under our longstanding 
interpretation of the term ‘‘covered Part 
D drug,’’ and based upon scientific 
evidence and medical standards of 
practice, Part D sponsors will only be 
required to include on their formularies 
all chemically distinct drugs from the 
protected classes or categories in order 
to the meet the provision in section 176 
of MIPPA. Thus, two drug products that 
are determined to be therapeutic 
equivalents by the FDA and identified 
as such in the FDA’s Orange Book are 
considered to be the same Part D ‘‘drug’’ 
and would not be required on all 
formularies. 
We also believe that it is important to 
consider safety and general drug and 
population applicability issues in the 
context of the new protections under 
section 176 of MIPPA. Although, as 
noted above, we believe that section 176 
of MIPPA is intended to provide 
additional beneficiary protections, we 
believe it would be imprudent to 
interpret these new protections in such 
a way that they interfere with existing 
protections intended to promote safety 
and efficacy. For example, we believe 
that it is appropriate for Part D sponsors 
to establish edits for safety and that our 
policies not interfere with basic drug 
utilization management edits that 
sponsors apply at point-of-sale to ensure 
that adverse events do not occur. Such 
edits must be consistent with FDA 
labeling to ensure that they are based on 
scientific evidence and medical 
standards of practice. Indeed, we 
believe that any interpretation of section 
176 of MIPPA that interferes with a 
plan’s ability to impose safety edits 
would defeat the very purpose of 
section 176 of MIPPA. 
In order to minimize confusion about 
the scope of the protections under 
section 176 of MIPPA, we clarify that 
the formulary requirements set forth in 
section 1860D–4(b)(3)(G)(ii) of the Act 
apply only to Part D drugs; therefore, 
drugs that are not Part D drugs need not 
be included on a plan’s formulary, even 
if a particular non-Part-D drug might 
otherwise be included in a protected 
class or category under section 176 of 
MIPPA. In other words, the MIPPA 
protections do not apply to non-Part D 
drugs and their exclusion from the 
formulary requirements is not based on 
our exceptions authority under section 
1860D–4(b)(3)(G)(iii) of the Act. Further, 
we do not require now as part of our six 
class policy, and would not require 
under the authority of section 176 of 
MIPPA, the inclusion of drugs that have 
been historically paid for under Part B 
(for example, ‘‘incident to’’ drugs 
supplied and administered by 
physicians during patient visit and paid 
for under Part B) or whose regulatory 
status under the definition of a Part D

drug at § 423.100 is not known. Given 
the fact that these drugs are not covered 
under Part D today, we believe their 
lack of presence on plan formularies 
would not disrupt access. We further 
believe that requiring the inclusion of 
these drugs on the formulary when they 
are not payable under Part D would lead 
to beneficiary confusion, particularly 
with respect to drugs with an unknown 
approval status. For these reasons, we 
are proposing to exclude drugs with 
very limited applicability to the 
Medicare Part D population and non- 
Part D drugs from the formulary 
requirements under section 176 of 
MIPPA. 
Therefore, we have added a new 
paragraph to § 423.120(b)(2) to clarify 
exceptions to the inclusion of all drugs 
meeting the criteria under section 176 of 
MIPPA. Under § 423.120(b)(2)(vi), 
exceptions would include the following: 
• Drug products that are determined 
to be therapeutic equivalents under the 
FDA’s Orange Book; 
• Edits that limit the quantity of 
drugs due to safety; and 
• Other drugs that we may specify 
through a process that is based upon 
scientific evidence and medical 
standards of practice (and, in the case of 
antiretroviral medications, is consistent 
with the Department of Health and 
Human Services Guidelines for the Use 
of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV–1– 
Infected Adults and Adolescents) and 
which permits public notice and 
comment. 
We welcome comment on these 
proposed definitions and clarifications. 
As noted previously, we now believe 
that the process outlined in the January 
16, 2009 IFC may be too burdensome to 
pursue. One practical concern with that 
process is one of timing. We no longer 
consider it feasible by contract year 
2011 to complete the process outlined 
in the January 16, 2009 IFC, in which 
we would—(1) contract with an 
organization to complete a data-driven 
analysis to identify possible protected 
classes and exceptions under the 
MIPPA; (2) decide on the composition, 
independence, expertise, potential 
conflicts of interest, and balance of 
individuals chosen to participate in the 
second-level validation panel that 
would arrive a consensus-driven set of 
recommendations; and (3) complete 
notice-and-comment rulemaking to both 
identify the protected categories or 
classes and to establish exceptions. 
Additionally, periodic updates and 
adjustments to the protected categories 
and classes, as well as to the exceptions, 
would take longer to implement if the 
process contemplated in the preamble 
were followed every year or some 
periodic timeframe thereafter. 
We continue to believe that the best 
way to determine which drug classes 
meet the MIPPA criteria is through a 
data-driven process, which includes an 
analysis of prescription drug event data, 
a review of widely used treatment 
guidelines, validation of the results by 
a expert committee of clinicians, and 
acceptance by the Secretary. By widely 
used treatment guidelines, we mean 
clinical literature that we consider to 
represent best practices. We envision 
these would include references in such 
sources as the Cochrane database and 
the AHRQ National Guideline 
Clearinghouse (NGC), and to include 
literature referred to in the Part D 
statutory compendia. (For more 
information on the Cochrane database 
and the NGC are see their Web sites at 
http://www.cochrane.org/reviews and 
http://www.guideline.gov/, 
respectively.) Therefore, it is our 
expectation that we will undertake the 
following multilevel process, which we 
again state is critical to any future 
identification of protected formulary 
classes under the Part D program: 
• Commence an initial data-driven 
analysis of widely used treatment 
guidelines and Part D utilization data to 
identify the following: 
++ Possible categories and classes of 
drugs, including those of the existing six 
classes of clinical concern, that meet the 
requirements for protected categories 
and classes; and 
++ Any potential exceptions to the 
requirement that all drugs from 
protected categories or classes be 
included on Part D sponsor formularies. 
We note that a review of treatment 
guidelines along with the review of the 
prescription drug event data will 
provide us with the necessary data to 
make informed decisions on the 
identification of MIPPA protected 
classes to present to the Secretary. 
• Arrange for a secondary review by 
a group of government clinicians that 
will serve to validate the findings of the 
initial analysis. We believe that an 
expert Government panel will best assist 
us in appropriately weighing the data 
derived from the initial analysis against 
the statutory requirements to identify 
protected categories or classes of drugs 
in which ‘‘access to multiple drugs 
within a category or class’’ is needed 
because ‘‘major or life threatening 
clinical consequences’’ may arise if 
access is restricted. Furthermore, we 
believe the expert panel will be well 
positioned to consider the data that may 
suggest possible exceptions and 
consider this data in light of the 
protected categories or classes in order 
to identify exceptions that are based 
upon available scientific evidence and 
medical standards of practice. 
Moreover, an expert panel of 
government physicians and pharmacists 
will obviate any problems surrounding 
independence of clinical judgment and 
potential conflicts of interest. 
• Present recommendations to the 
Secretary of HHS of the drug classes or 
categories, and any recommended 
exceptions. 
We note that the main difference 
between these data-driven process 
described here and the process outlined 
in the January 16, 2009 IFC is the 
composition of the clinical committee 
that will serve a validation review. As 
we noted above, an expert panel 
composed solely of government 
physicians and pharmacists would 
obviate any problems surrounding 
independence of clinical judgment and 
potential conflicts of interest, and 
would simplify the process compared to 
an external panel commissioned under 
the FACA. 
With regard to the designation of the 
drug classes themselves and the manner 
in which they are announced, we 
believe there are two options and solicit 
comment on which option the public 
believes will allow us to make timely 
determinations in a transparent manner. 
Option 1: Announce protected classes 
through subregulatory guidance (for 
example, the Call Letter) that provides 
a notice and comment process but does 
not entail full notice and comment 
rulemaking. 
One option would be to promulgate 
regulations that set forth the criteria we 
would use to identify the protected 
classes and to apply those criteria as 
part of the data analysis and validation 
process described above, but to 
announce the protected classes that 
result from this process through 
subregulatory guidance, such as CMS’s 
annual Call Letter to Part D plans, or 
alternatively through a separate Federal 
Register notice. Under either vehicle, 
we would invite comment prior to the 
final announcement of the protected 
classes and exceptions thereto, and 
prior to finalizing any changes to the 
protected classes or exceptions. We 
believe this approach represents a more 
simplified and streamlined process. We 
further believe that this simplified and 
streamlined process would provide 
ample opportunity for public input and 
adequate protection of the public 
interest in the determination of the 
protected classes and any exceptions 
thereto. 
Furthermore, we believe that this 
process also is consistent with other 
processes we use to make similar

determinations. For example, under 
Medicare Part B, coverage of off-label 
use of anticancer therapies may include 
uses that are supported by certain drug 
compendia. In the CY 2008 Medicare 
Physician Fee Schedule final rule, we 
implemented a new process to make 
changes to the list of Part B-accepted 
compendia. This process involves 
posting materials on the CMS website, 
soliciting comment, and announcing 
final decision through nonregulatory 
means. 
Option 2—Announce the protected 
classes through formal notice and 
comment rulemaking. 
A second option would be to 
undertake the clinical and data driven 
review process described above and 
after promulgating regulations 
addressing the criteria for identifying 
the protected classes, implement the 
proposed protected classes themselves 
through notice and comment 
rulemaking, consistent with our 
proposal in the January 16, 2009 IFC. 
We welcome comments on these two 
approaches for soliciting public 
comment and announcing the protected 
categories or classes of drugs required 
for inclusion on Part D sponsor 
formularies. We note that, given the 
implementation timeframes discussed 
above, as well as the need to ensure 
consistency in formulary coverage as we 
complete our analysis to implement the 
requirements of section 1860D– 
4(b)(3)(G)(i) of the Act, we will retain 
our existing six classes of clinical 
concern contained in Chapter 6 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 
Manual (section 30.2.5) for contract year 
2010. We further note that any decisions 
with respect to the retention of these 
classes for the 2011 contract year will be 
made either through a separate 
rulemaking that identifies the MIPPA 
protected classes and any exceptions 
thereto and/or as part of the 2011 Call 
Letter to Part D plans. 
2. Pro-rating the Plan Deductible for Part 
C MSA Enrollments Occurring During 
an Initial Coverage Election Period 
(§ 422.103) 
Section 1851(a)(2)(B) of the Act 
establishes Medicare Medical Savings 
Account (MSA) plans as a type of health 
insurance plan that combines both a tax 
advantaged savings account and a high- 
deductible health insurance policy. 
Under this MA plan option, Medicare 
pays the MA organization offering the 
MA plan the premium amount charged 
by the organization for a high- 
deductible insurance policy and the 
remainder of the MA payment amount 
is deposited in the enrollee’s savings 
account. If an individual enrolls in such 
a plan mid-year, a pro-rated share 
corresponding to the number of months 
remaining in the calendar year is placed 
into the individual’s savings account. 
As provided under § 422.103(d), 
however, beneficiaries newly eligible for 
Medicare who enroll in MSAs midyear 
pursuant to an initial coverage election 
period (ICEP) are currently required to 
pay a full deductible for the calendar 
year. For example, an enrollee whose 
65th birthday is in May and who 
chooses to enroll May 1 will be given 8/ 
12ths of the deposit that has been 
approved for the plan for the year, but 
this enrollee is required to pay the full 
deductible approved for the plan for the 
entire calendar year. An enrollee whose 
65th birthday is later in the year could 
enroll, for example, on September 1 and 
would receive a pro-rated deposit 
representing only 4/12ths of the year; 
however, this enrollee would also be 
required to pay the full calendar year 
deductible. 
We are proposing to interpret the 
deductible requirement as implicitly 
applying only for the number of months 
in which a beneficiary is enrolled in the 
MSA plan, and accordingly are 
proposing to revise § 422.103(d) to allow 
beneficiaries who enroll during the year 
as ICEP enrollments to pay only a pro- 
rated deductible consistent with the 
pro-rated deposit they receive. This rule 
would also apply to disabled enrollees 
under age 65 who become eligible for 
Medicare during the year. Interested 
beneficiaries may inquire with potential 
MSA plans about their options prior to 
enrollment, and, upon enrollment, 
would receive a confirmation of 
enrollment letter that would inform 
them of both their pro-rated deposit 
amount and their pro-rated deductible. 
G. Changes To Clarify Various Program 
Participation Requirements 
We have worked with sponsoring 
organizations to implement and 
operationalize the Medicare Advantage 
and Prescription Drug Benefit Programs 
over the past 4 years. As part of this 
partnership, we have implemented 
operational and/or policy guidance via 
HPMS memoranda or manual 
instruction to assist sponsoring 
organizations in ensuring the proper 
and efficient administration of the Part 
C and D programs. The proposed 
regulations in this section either clarify 
existing regulations or implement new 
requirements consistent with existing 
policy guidance, to assist sponsoring 
organizations with attaining the goals 
envisioned by the Congress when the 
legislation implementing the Medicare 
Advantage and Prescription Drug 
Benefit programs was first passed. These 
clarifications are detailed in Table 7.

1. Uniform Benefits Under Parts C and 
D (§ 422.100(d) and § 423.104) 
Section 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act 
requires a Medicare Advantage (MA) 
organization offering a plan to select the 
providers from whom the benefits under 
the plan are provided so long as the 
organization makes such benefits 
available and accessible to each 
individual electing the plan within the 
plan’s service area with reasonable 
promptness and in a manner which 
assures continuity in the provision of 
benefits. Section 1860D–2(a) of the Act 
defines qualified prescription drug 
coverage to mean access to standard or 
actuarially equivalent prescription drug 
coverage and access to negotiated prices 
(in accordance with section 1860D–2(d) 
of the Act). We codified these sections 
in our regulations at § 422.100(d) and 
§ 423.104(b). 
Both sections currently require that 
either an MA organization or PDP 
sponsor offering a plan must offer that 
plan to all eligible beneficiaries residing 
in the plan’s service area, or for MA 
organizations, a subset of the plan’s 
service area. We further interpret 
section 1860D–2(a) of the Act as 
requiring the provision of uniform 
premiums and benefits. 
We have provided guidance to Part D 
sponsors on several occasions indicating 
that varying cost-sharing or premiums, 
including waiving cost-sharing or 
premiums, violates the uniform benefit 
requirements at § 423.104(b) because 
doing so results in the Part D sponsor’s 
plan not providing uniform premiums 
and benefits to all eligible beneficiaries 
within its service area. We have further 
informed Part D sponsors that their 
failure to collect cost-sharing at the time 
the service is provided or to attempt to 
collect cost-sharing or bill cost-sharing 
to the appropriate party (either a 
beneficiary or another payer) after the 
fact is in violation of the uniform benefit 
provisions set forth in the current 
regulation at § 423.104(b). 
However, we believe that § 423.104(b) 
is not clear in regard to the PDP 
sponsor’s imposition of uniform 
premiums and cost-sharing. Therefore, 
we propose to revise § 423.104(b) to 
mirror the language at § 422.100 to 
specify that Part D sponsors apply 
uniform premiums and cost-sharing. 
2. Ensuring the Security of Personal 
Health Information and Other 
Personally Identifiable Information 
(§ 422.504 and § 423.505) 
In the contract provisions sections of 
subpart K of parts 422 and 423, we 
specify that MAOs and Part D sponsors 
must permit access to their facilities by 
the Secretary or his or her designee. 
Access to facilities must be granted in 
connection with the Secretary’s right to 
evaluate through audit, inspection, or 
other means MAO and Part D sponsor 
compliance with Medicare contract 
requirements, including the quality, 
appropriateness, and timeliness of 
services. 
We interpret the Secretary’s right to 
audit or inspect compliance with MA 
and Part D program regulations to 
include evaluation of compliance with 
CMS requirements for maintaining the 
privacy and security of personal health 
information and other personally 
identifiable information of Medicare 
enrollees. In order to clarify our policy 
that beneficiaries’ personal health 
information and other personally 
identifiable information must remain 
secure, we propose to revise § 422.504 
and § 423.505 to make this 
interpretation explicit. In a related 
change, we propose to clarify that we 
interpret the term ‘‘facilities’’ to include 
an MAO’s or Part D sponsor’s computer 
or other electronic systems. We would 
implement these proposed changes at 
§ 422.504(e)(1)(ii) and § 423.505(e)(1)(ii). 
We are also proposing conforming 
changes to the contract requirements 
related to downstream entities at 
§ 422.504(i)(2)(i) and § 423.505(i)(2)(i), 
respectively. Note that while we do not 
believe our authority extends to 
accessing the facilities of downstream 
entities, we may review systems and 
computer-generated information from 
downstream entities for compliance 
with privacy and security requirements. 
Such information includes, but is not 
limited to, backup tapes, print outs of 
screen shots, CDs, and similar 
information. 
We encourage the use of 
computerized and electronic systems by 
MAOs and Part D sponsors. We are 
aware, however, of the additional 
potential for security and privacy 
breaches in a computerized/electronic 
context. Our proposed changes are 
designed to ensure that beneficiaries’ 
protected health information and 
personally identifiable information 
associated with their enrollment remain 
private and secure. 
3. Requirement for Sponsoring 
Organizations Under Parts C and D To 
Report Other Payer Information to the 
Coordination of Benefits Contractor 
(§ 422.108 and § 423.464) 
Section 1852(a)(4) of the Act provides 
that an MA organization may charge or 
authorize a provider to seek 
reimbursement for services from a 
beneficiary or third party to the extent 
that payment is made secondary under 
section 1862(b)(2) of the Act. Section 
1860D–2(a)(4) of the Act extends the 
Medicare secondary payer (MSP) 
procedures applicable to MA 
organizations under section 1852(a)(4) 
of the Act to Part D sponsors and their 
provision of qualified prescription drug 
coverage. This authority is implemented 
for MA organizations in § 422.108 and 
for Medicare PDPs in § 423.462, as well 
as in CMS manuals. 
MA organizations are responsible for 
identifying payers that are primary to 
Part C of Medicare, determining the 
amounts payable by those payers, and 
for coordinating the benefits the plan 
offers with the benefits of such payers. 
Additionally, MA organizations must 
take into account Part C costs that could 
have been recovered or avoided due to 
MSP when determining costs in the base 
period. MA organizations must account 
for Part C MSP amounts in one of three 
ways. MA organizations must— 
• Recover from liable third parties; 
• Avoid Part C costs by directing 
providers to bill liable third parties 
directly; or 
• Account for Part C costs that could 
have been recovered or avoided, but that 
were actually not recovered or avoided,

54691 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
by not including them in Part C base 
period costs. 
MA organizations and PDPs are 
required to follow the same rules 
regarding— 
• Their responsibilities under the 
MSP statutory and regulatory 
provisions; 
• Collection of payment from 
insurers, group health plans and large 
group health plans, the enrollee, or 
other entities for covered Part D drugs; 
and 
• The interaction of MSP rules with 
State laws. 
Sections 1860D–23 and 1860D–24 of 
the Act also require a Part D sponsor to 
coordinate with SPAPs, as well as other 
drug plans, including Medicaid 
programs, group health plans, FEHBP, 
military coverage, and other plans or 
programs providing prescription drug 
coverage. To support the required 
benefit coordination, section 1860D– 
2(b)(4)(D)(ii) of the Act permits Part D 
sponsors to request information on third 
party insurance from beneficiaries. The 
authority for COB, as well as for 
information collection from 
beneficiaries is implemented for 
prescription drug sponsors in § 423.464 
and in the Coordination of Benefits 
chapter of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual. 
The growing number of CMS data 
sharing agreements with other payers 
has improved the volume and quality of 
other payer information available to MA 
organizations and prescription drug 
sponsors on the COB data file from 
CMS. New mandatory insurer reporting 
of MSP group health plan coverage, 
liability insurance, no-fault insurance 
and workers’ compensation, required by 
section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and State Children’s Health Insurance 
Program (SCHIP) Extension Act of 2007 
(Pub. L. 110–173), will further expand 
the other payer information available for 
MA organization and PDP MSP 
procedures and for Part D sponsor 
coordination of benefits. (See 42 U.S.C. 
1395y(b)(7) and (8).) Most insurers will 
need to report their own coverage 
already. It is only when an MA 
organization becomes aware of coverage 
that is primary to Medicare offered by 
another insurer that it will need to 
report under this rule. In addition to 
these advances, we continue to seek 
improvements to the quality of the MSP 
and COB information we report to MA 
organizations and Part D sponsors. We 
believe the best means to accomplish 
this is to rely primarily on the most 
reliable sources of other coverage 
information. Based on our experience, 
these sources tend to be the other 
insurers. 
However, MA organizations and PDP 
sponsors will on occasion continue to 
receive information about other 
coverage from their enrollees, as well as 
other sources. While our MA program 
policy does not currently include 
reporting requirements, Part D 
subregulatory policy guidance, reflected 
in section 50.2 of the Coordination of 
Benefits chapter of the Prescription 
Drug Benefit Manual, requires that PDP 
sponsors submit other coverage 
information that is brought to their 
attention within 30 days of receipt to 
the CMS COB Contractor for verification 
and application of the verified data to 
our data systems. 
Given the importance of the other 
payer information to MA organization 
and PDP MSP procedures and for 
prescription drug program coordination 
of benefits, we propose to require the 
reporting of other coverage information 
in § 422.108 for MA organizations and 
§ 423.462 and § 423.464 for PDP 
sponsors. Given concerns regarding the 
quality of the information, we propose 
to limit the information reported to that 
which is reported to the sponsor as 
being inconsistent with existing 
information on the COB file. 
Specifically, we propose to include in 
regulatory text the requirement that MA 
organizations and Part D sponsors, upon 
being notified of credible new 
information regarding other payers or 
changes to existing other payer 
information, report this information to 
the CMS COB Contractor in accordance 
with the processes and timeframes 
established by CMS. By ‘‘credible’’ we 
mean information that is consistent with 
conventions for how group health 
insurance coverage is identified, for 
instance including the name and 
address of the insurance company and 
the policy identification number. We 
also propose to extend the reporting 
requirements to MA organizations as 
they relate to other primary payers. We 
note that Medicare MA organizations 
and Part D sponsors should never be 
reported to CMS as a ‘‘primary’’ payer. 
In the absence of another (that is, non- 
Medicare) primary payer, the MA 
organization or Part D plan is always 
primary. This is not to say that if an 
enrollee has primary individual or 
employer group coverage through the 
same insurer or organization through 
which they also have MA or Part D 
coverage, such primary coverage should 
not be reported. In fact, such coverage 
must be reported. However, reporting 
Medicare itself as primary serves no 
purpose and merely causes confusion. 
The proposed changes described in 
this section of the proposed rule would 
impose a new requirement on MA 
organizations but would not change 
current MSP and coordination of 
benefits policy for the prescription drug 
program. 
4. Visitor/Traveler Benefit Under Part C 
for the Purpose of Extending Enrollment 
Up to 12 Months (§ 422.74) 
Under our authority to establish 
special rules for the enrollment of 
beneficiaries in MA plans at section 
1851(b) of the Act, we had previously 
described in the Medicare Advantage 
regulations a visitor/traveler (V/T) 
benefit. Specifically, § 422.74(d)(4)(iii) 
established an exception to our 
disenrollment requirements, under 
which a plan member must be 
disenrolled when out of the service area 
for more than 6 months. Under this 
exception, MA plans may offer their 
enrollees extended enrollment in the 
plan when they are out of the plan 
service area, but within the United 
States, from 6 to 12 months if the plan 
covers services other than emergent, 
urgent, maintenance and post 
stabilization, and renal dialysis services. 
Section 422.74(d)(iii) establishes that an 
MAO can offer a ‘‘visitor’’ or ‘‘traveler’’ 
type program which would allow its 
enrollees to remain enrolled in the plan 
while out of the plan’s service area for 
up to 12 months. We note that 
Medicare-covered services can only be 
covered within the United States. 
Although we stated in the preamble of 
the Medicare+Choice program; Managed 
Care Provisions final rule, published in 
the August 22, 2003 Federal Register 
(68 FR 50848), that the visitor or traveler 
program must cover ‘‘the full range of 
services available to other members,’’ 
we did not specify in regulation text 
what we intended by ‘‘full range of 
services.’’ 
Given the lack of specificity in our 
regulations, we have received a number 
of questions since that time regarding 
what services must be covered through 
a V/T program if an MA plan wishes to 
retain members up to 12 months when 
those members are residing outside the 
service area. We propose to amend 
§ 422.74(d)(4)(iii) to specify that an 
MAO may offer an extended enrollment 
V/T option under an MA plan if that 
plan furnishes all plan covered 
services—that is, Medicare Parts A and 
B services and all mandatory and 
optional supplemental benefits—at in- 
network cost-sharing levels consistent 
with Medicare access and availability 
requirements at § 422.112. An MAO 
offering a V/T benefit under an MA plan 
must make the option available to all 
plan enrollees. Specifically, the V/T 
benefit must be available to all plan 
enrollees who are temporarily in the

the area. 
5. Medication Therapy Management 
Programs Under Part D (§ 423.153(d)) 
Section 1860D–4(c)(1)(c) of the Act 
requires Part D sponsors to establish 
Medication Therapy Management 
programs (MTMP) and section 1860D– 
4(c)(2) of the Act requires MTMPs to be 
designed to ensure, with respect to 
targeted beneficiaries described in 
section 1860D–4(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 
that covered Part D drugs are 
appropriately used to optimize 
therapeutic outcomes through improved 
medication use and to reduce the risk of 
adverse events. These requirements are 
codified at § 423.153(d) of the Part D 
regulations. 
Section 423.153(d)(1) requires each 
Part D sponsor to establish a MTMP that 
is designed to ensure that covered Part 
D drugs (as defined in § 423.100) 
prescribed to targeted beneficiaries are 
appropriately used to optimize 
therapeutic outcomes through improved 
medication use; designed to reduce the 
risk of adverse events for targeted 
beneficiaries; furnished by a pharmacist 
or other qualified provider; and allowed 
to distinguish between services 
provided in ambulatory and 
institutional settings. Section 
423.153(d)(2) defines targeted 
beneficiaries as enrollees who have 
multiple chronic diseases, are taking 
multiple Part D drugs, and are likely to 
incur annual costs for covered Part D 
drugs that exceed a predetermined level 
as specified by the Secretary. 
In the original Part D final rule (that 
is, the January 28, 2005 final rule), we 
did not identify specific medication 
therapy management (MTM) 
requirements beyond those contained in 
the Act because there was insufficient 
industry experience and no widely 
accepted standard practices for MTMPs. 
Moreover, we also believed that in the 
future outcomes measures would 
provide the best method for evaluating 
MTMPs and promoting the most 
effective programs. However, given the 
experience garnered from the first few 
years for the Part D program, and as we 
still await further development of 
MTMP outcomes measures that can 
serve the Part D program, we have 
determined that it necessary to have 
more specific Part D MTMP 
requirements for enrollment methods, 
targeting procedures, and MTM 
services. Accordingly, in the 2010 Call 
Letter, we included policy guidance 
regarding the implementation of 
MTMPs. This policy guidance reflects 
common practices among Part D 
MTMPs that were derived from our 
extensive review of MTMP applications, 
plan-reported data, exploratory research 
on MTM, informal interviews with Part 
D sponsors, and other relevant literature 
and data. In this rule, we are proposing 
to codify this policy guidance in 
§ 423.153(d). We believe the proposed 
changes to the MTMP requirements will 
promote greater consistency across the 
Part D program that will allow for better 
evaluation and comparison of MTMPs 
when outcomes measures become 
available. 
Specifically, in accordance with 
sections 1860D–4(c)(1)(C) and 1860D– 
4(c)(2) of the Act, we propose to add the 
following requirements: 
• Part D sponsors shall use only an 
opt-out method for MTMP enrollment; 
• Part D sponsors shall target 
beneficiaries for MTMP enrollment at 
least quarterly during each plan year; 
and 
• Part D sponsors shall offer a 
minimum level of MTM services for 
each beneficiary enrolled in the MTMP 
that includes interventions for both, 
beneficiaries and prescribers, annual 
comprehensive medication reviews, and 
quarterly targeted medication reviews. 
In addition, we are proposing to 
revise the requirements for targeting 
beneficiaries who have multiple chronic 
diseases and take multiple Part D drugs 
by specifying the maximum number of 
multiple chronic diseases and multiple 
Part D drugs that Part D sponsors may 
establish as a minimum threshold for 
satisfying their MTMP targeting criteria. 
We propose adding § 423.153(d)(1)(v) 
to require Part D sponsors to enroll 
beneficiaries in their MTMPs using an 
opt-out method of enrollment only. 
Under this proposal, a beneficiary that 
meets the targeting criteria would be 
auto-enrolled into the MTMP and 
considered to be enrolled unless the he 
or she declines enrollment. This opt-out 
method of enrollment is currently the 
preferred method of enrollment among 
Part D sponsors, used by approximately 
85 percent of current MTMPs, and has 
increased enrollment of targeted 
beneficiaries into MTMPs. As a result, 
we believe that requiring an opt-out 
method of enrollment will provide more 
beneficiaries with access to MTM 
services. 
We also propose adding 
§ 423.153(d)(1)(vi) to require Part D 
sponsors to target beneficiaries for 
enrollment in the MTMP at least 
quarterly during each plan year. 
Currently, more than 95 percent of Part 
D sponsors target beneficiaries for 
enrollment in their MTMPs on a daily, 
weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. We 
believe that making this a requirement 
for all Part D sponsors will allow more 
Medicare beneficiaries to have access to 
the MTMP earlier in the year. Part D 
sponsors also can promote continuity of 
care by identifying current MTMP 
enrollees towards the end of a plan year 
who will qualify for MTMP enrollment 
in the next plan year. This practice 
would allow the Part D sponsors to have 
such beneficiaries enrolled in their 
MTMP at the beginning of the next plan 
year. 
We also propose adding 
§ 423.153(d)(1)(vii) to require Part D 
sponsors to offer a minimum level of 
MTM services for each beneficiary 
enrolled in the MTMP that includes 
interventions for both beneficiaries and 
prescribers; annual comprehensive 
medication reviews; and quarterly 
targeted medication reviews. In 2008, 
approximately 90 percent of Part D 
MTMPs provided interventions 
targeting both beneficiaries and 
prescribers. Our proposed requirement 
that MTMPs include interventions for 
both beneficiaries and prescribers does 
not mean, however, that all 
interventions must target both the 
beneficiary and the prescriber. Instead, 
Part D sponsors must determine if the 
beneficiary, prescriber, or both should 
be targeted for any specific intervention 
or interventions. Prescriber 
interventions may be passive (for 
example, faxed or mailed) and should 
be targeted to resolve potential 
medication-related issues or other 
opportunities to optimize medication 
use. 
Furthermore, while Part D sponsors 
may incorporate passive or ‘‘lower 
touch’’ beneficiary interventions, such 
as education newsletters, drug 
utilization review (DUR) edits, refill 
reminders, and medication lists into 
their MTMPs, where appropriate, these 
passive interventions cannot be the sole 
offerings. Part D sponsors must also 
offer MTM services to beneficiaries that 
include an interactive component, 
continued monitoring, and follow-up 
when necessary. In addition, Part D 
sponsors should have procedures in 
place to follow-up with beneficiaries 
that do not respond to initial offers for 
MTM services. 
Under this proposal, Part D sponsors 
would also be required to offer an 
annual comprehensive medication 
review (CMR) to all targeted 
beneficiaries. With the exception of 
targeted beneficiaries in long-term care 
settings, the CMR would be required to 
include an interactive, person-to-person 
consultation performed by a pharmacist 
or other qualified provider. A CMR is a 
review of a beneficiary’s medications 
including prescription medications,

over-the-counter (OTC) medications, 
herbal therapies and dietary 
supplements intended to aid in 
assessing medication therapy, and 
optimizing patient outcomes. The 
review of the beneficiary’s medication 
may be performed concurrently with the 
beneficiary consultation or prior to the 
consultation by a qualified provider or 
computerized clinical algorithm. The 
consultation must be a real-time 
interaction that is provided either face- 
to-face or via an alternative interactive 
method such as the telephone. Finally, 
the beneficiary must receive a written 
summary of the CMR and consultation 
that may include such things as a 
medication record, reconciled 
medication list, action plan, or 
recommendations for monitoring, 
education, or self management. 
In addition to the annual CMR, under 
this proposal, Part D sponsors would be 
required to perform targeted medication 
reviews for all beneficiaries enrolled in 
the MTMP no less often than quarterly. 
These targeted reviews would focus on 
assessing medication use since the CMR 
and determining if any issues that were 
identified during the CMR remain 
unresolved or if any new drug therapy 
issues have arisen. The Part D sponsor 
must assess the findings of these 
reviews to determine if a follow-up 
intervention is necessary with either the 
prescriber or beneficiary. Unlike the 
CMR, these interventions are not 
required to be interactive although it 
should be considered when appropriate. 
Consistent with section 1860D– 
4(c)(2)(ii)(A) of the Act, Part D sponsors 
must target beneficiaries who have 
multiple chronic diseases for MTM 
services. In the original rule, we left the 
determination of ‘‘multiple’’ and 
‘‘chronic disease’’ entirely to the Part D 
sponsors. In 2008, approximately 85 
percent of Part D MTMPs targeted 
beneficiaries with a minimum of two or 
three chronic diseases. Based upon our 
experience with Part D MTMPs since 
the beginning of the Part D program, we 
issued guidance in 2009 to clarify the 
range and types of diseases that will 
satisfy this requirement beginning in 
2010. 
In this rule, we propose to revise 
§ 423.153(d)(2)(i) to specify that the 
minimum number of multiple chronic 
diseases for targeted beneficiaries be no 
more than three. Under the proposed 
revision to § 423.153(d)(2)(i), we would 
require Part D sponsors to define the 
minimum threshold for ‘‘multiple’’ for 
purposes of targeting beneficiaries as no 
more than three chronic diseases. 
Therefore, Part D sponsors would be 
permitted to set their minimum 
threshold at two or three and target 
beneficiaries with at least two chronic 
diseases or at least three chronic 
diseases. 
Under this proposed revision to 
§ 423.153(d)(2)(i), Part D sponsors may 
continue to target any chronic diseases 
or limit MTMP enrollment to enrollees 
having specific chronic diseases. 
However, beginning in 2010, CMS 
guidance specifies, at a minimum, that 
Part D sponsors should target at least 
four of seven core chronic diseases that 
we have identified as prevalent in the 
Medicare population based upon the 
analysis of the RxHCC Risk Adjustment 
model, posing a risk to the Medicare 
Trust Fund, and reflecting the most 
common diseases targeted by Part D 
MTMPs in general. The seven chronic 
diseases are hypertension, heart failure, 
diabetes, dyslipidemia, respiratory 
disease, bone disease-arthritis, and 
mental health diseases such as 
depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar 
disorder. In determining whether a 
beneficiary meets the minimum number 
of multiple chronic diseases to be 
targeted for MTM services, a beneficiary 
could have any combination of the 
chronic diseases targeted by the Part D 
sponsor. 
Consistent with section 1860D– 
4(c)(2)(ii)(II) of the Act, plan sponsors 
must target beneficiaries taking multiple 
covered Part D drugs for MTM services. 
In the original Part D rule, we left the 
determination of ‘‘multiple’’ entirely to 
the Part D sponsors. Based upon our 
experience and extensive analysis of the 
Part D MTMPs since the beginning of 
the Part D program, we issued guidance 
in 2009 to clarify the range that plan 
sponsors should consider in order to 
satisfy the statutory requirement 
beginning in 2010. Specifically, we 
noted that Part D sponsors should 
define ‘‘multiple’’ for purposes of 
satisfying this requirement as no more 
than eight Part D drugs as the minimum 
number of multiple Part D drugs. 
Consistent with this policy guidance, 
we now propose to revise 
§ 423.153(d)(2)(ii) to specify that no 
more than eight multiple Part D drugs 
be established as a minimum for 
targeted beneficiaries. Therefore, Part D 
sponsors would be permitted to set this 
minimum threshold for MTMP 
eligibility at any number equal to or 
between two and eight. 
Under section 1860D–4(c)(2)(ii)(III) of 
the Act, plans must target beneficiaries 
that are likely to incur annual costs for 
covered Part D drugs that exceed a level 
specified by CMS. In the 2010 Call 
Letter, we specified a new, lower three 
thousand dollar threshold. Moving 
forward, we believe that it makes more 
sense to establish a dollar threshold 
based upon a benchmark that is tied to 
the Part D benefit. We believe that the 
initial coverage limit (ICL) for the Part 
D defined standard benefit provides a 
logical benchmark for the MTMP 
because it ensures that Part D sponsors 
will always be able to target enrollees at 
risk of entering the coverage gap. 
Accordingly, in this rule, we propose to 
revise § 423.153(d)(2)(iii) to specify that 
targeted beneficiaries must be likely to 
incur costs for covered Part D drugs that 
exceed the ICL for the Part D defined 
standard benefit for the applicable Part 
D plan year. 
6. Formulary Requirements— 
Development and Revision by a 
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee 
(§ 423.120) 
Section 1860D–4(b)(3)(A) of the Act 
requires Part D sponsors to use a 
pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) 
committee to develop and review the 
formulary if the Part D sponsor uses a 
formulary. In developing and reviewing 
the formulary, section 1860D–4(b)(3)(B) 
of the Act requires the P&T committee 
to base clinical decisions on the strength 
of scientific evidence and standards of 
practice, including accessing peer- 
reviewed medical literature, such as 
randomized clinical trials, 
pharmacoeconomic studies, outcomes 
research data, and on such other 
information as the committee 
determines to be appropriate. The P&T 
committee must also consider whether 
the inclusion of a particular Part D drug 
in a formulary or formulary tier has any 
therapeutic advantages in terms of 
safety and efficacy. We codified these 
requirements at § 423.120(b)(1). 
In the preamble to the January 28, 
2005 final rule (70 FR 4193) and 
subsequent formulary guidance, we 
distinguished between the roles of the 
P&T committee in determining which 
drugs are placed on a formulary versus 
the application of utilization 
management tools that are applied to 
the drugs placed on the formulary. 
Specifically, we said that the P&T 
committee recommendations regarding 
which Part D drugs are placed on a 
formulary are binding on the Part D 
sponsor while recommendations 
regarding utilization management tools 
such as prior authorization (PA), step 
therapy, and quantity limits are 
advisory only and not binding on the 
Part D sponsor. We made this 
distinction because we believed that the 
placement of a drug on the formulary 
was the primary clinical decision in 
developing a formulary while the 
application of utilization management 
tools, although clinically justified, 
required the consideration of additional

54694 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
financial and benefit design criteria that 
went beyond the scope of the P&T 
committee role. Consequently, we 
believed it was only necessary for the 
P&T committee to review for clinical 
appropriateness Part D sponsor policies 
that guide utilization management 
processes and codified this requirement 
in § 423.120(b)(vi). 
We have gained a better 
understanding of the formulary 
development process since the 
beginning of the Part D program and 
now recognize that the application of 
PA criteria, step therapy, and quantity 
limits are as important to the clinical 
soundness of a formulary as the drugs 
that are included. Access to Part D drugs 
may be influenced as much by the 
application of PA criteria, step therapy 
requirements, or quantity limit 
restrictions as it can be by exclusion of 
a Part D drug from a Part D formulary. 
For example, one formulary could list 
twice as many drugs as another 
formulary but if all the additional drugs 
on the second formulary are subject to 
PA requirements, overall access to Part 
D drugs may be the same under both 
formularies. For this reason, our 
formulary review process has not been 
limited to evaluating the number and 
types of drugs on Part D formularies but 
also includes the review of the specific 
PA criteria, step therapy requirements, 
and quantity limit restrictions that are 
applied within the Part D formularies. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 
1860D–4(b)(3)(A) and (b)(3)(B) of the 
Act, we propose adding new paragraph 
§ 423.120(b)(1)(ix) to require Part D P&T 
committees to review and approve all 
clinical PA criteria, step therapy 
protocols, and quantity limit restrictions 
applied to each covered Part D drug. 
PA criteria, step therapy 
requirements, and quantity limits 
directly affect beneficiary access to 
formulary drugs. Because P&T 
committees must review and approve all 
drugs before they may be added to a 
formulary, we also believe it is 
necessary that all PA criteria, step 
therapy protocols, and quantity limits 
be approved by P&T committees prior to 
their application to formulary drugs. We 
continue to recognize that the decision 
to apply such utilization management 
tools is not based solely upon clinical 
considerations and, therefore, remains 
the responsibility of the Part D sponsors. 
However, we believe this new 
requirement adds a necessary 
beneficiary protection by ensuring that 
independent clinical experts have 
reviewed and approved each 
application of these utilization 
management tools for clinical 
appropriateness. It is our understanding 
that this is standard practice for P&T 
committees, and therefore, do not 
believe this requirement creates an 
additional burden. 
Finally, we do not believe it is 
necessary for P&T committees to review 
and approve administrative PA criteria 
such as those used to make ‘‘B vs. D’’ 
determinations. Only PA criteria that 
require clinical information and 
justification require the review and 
approval of the P&T committee. 
7. Generic Equivalent Disclosure Under 
Part D (§ 423.132) 
Section 1860D–4(k)(1) of the Act 
requires a Part D sponsor to have each 
of their network pharmacies inform 
enrollees of any difference between the 
price of the drug(s) they are purchasing 
via the plan and the price of the lowest 
priced therapeutically equivalent 
generic product available to the 
pharmacy. Section 1860D–4(k)(2)(A) of 
the Act requires that this information be 
provided at the time of purchase except 
for purchases delivered by mail when it 
must be provided at the time of 
delivery. Under section 1860D– 
4(k)(2)(B) of the Act the Secretary has 
the authority to waive this requirement 
for certain entities in certain cases as 
specified in § 423.132(c). 
In § 423.132(d), we specified that for 
enrollees in long-term care pharmacy 
settings, the timing portion of the 
disclosure requirement (that is, the 
requirement that the enrollee be 
informed at time of purchase) may be 
waived. Accordingly, sponsors are 
required to disclose the differential (if 
any) in pricing for long-term care 
network pharmacies by requiring that 
this information be provided in the 
explanation of benefits (EOB). 
Over time, we have heard from 
sponsors, as well as pharmaceutical 
benefit managers on behalf of sponsors, 
that providing this information in the 
EOB is unworkable from a plan 
operational standpoint. Primarily, this is 
due to the fact that information on 
generic pricing can—and often does— 
vary day to day; thus, sponsors cannot 
accurately reflect the differential within 
a monthly EOB. Additionally, sponsors 
have pointed out that they would need 
to program the generic equivalent prices 
for all drugs specific to a particular 
LTC’s contracted reimbursement rate 
into their systems to populate 
electronically on the EOB, which 
represents a significant programming 
and financial burden. 
We also believe the generic equivalent 
information provided on the EOB is of 
no value to the long-term care 
beneficiary. In the LTC setting, the 
beneficiary receives the medication after 
the prescription drug claim has been 
submitted by the LTC pharmacy and 
processed by the Part D sponsor. 
Therefore, the ability of the beneficiary 
to make changes at the point-of-service 
based upon information provided on the 
EOB is simply not feasible. Unlike the 
enrollee standing at the retail pharmacy 
counter at time of service, enrollees in 
long-term care institutions have limited 
opportunities to affect a switch to a 
lower-priced generic substitute before 
dispensing. Because of this limitation, 
we have not enforced this regulatory 
requirement and have not included 
model language that addresses this 
requirement in the EOB. 
For the aforementioned reasons, we 
are proposing to revise § 423.132(c) by 
adding long-term care network 
pharmacies to the list of entities for 
which from the public disclosure 
requirement is waived, and revise 
§ 423.132(d) to remove the requirement 
that long-term care network pharmacies 
provide the pricing differential 
information in enrollees’ EOBs. 
8. Access to Covered Part D Drugs 
(§ 423.120) 
The statute at sections 1860D– 
4(b)(1)(C) and 1860D–21(c)(1) of the Act 
establishes the standards for convenient 
access for network pharmacies for PDP 
sponsors and other Part D sponsors. 
This section of the statute requires that 
the sponsor of a PDP shall secure the 
participation in its network of a 
sufficient number of pharmacies that 
dispense (other than by mail order) 
drugs directly to patients to ensure 
convenient access consistent with the 
rules established by the Secretary, and 
as long as they are no less favorable than 
the TRICARE pharmacy access 
standards. 
A TRICARE contractor is required to 
maintain a pharmacy network sufficient 
to meet the following minimum 
beneficiary access standards on an 
overall basis—Urban: a pharmacy 
within 2 miles of 90 percent of the 
beneficiaries; Suburban: a pharmacy 
within five miles of 90 percent of the 
beneficiaries; and Rural: a pharmacy 
within fifteen miles of 70 percent of the 
beneficiaries. We adopted into 
regulation these standards, but instead 
of specifying them at the contract or 
PDP sponsor level, erroneously 
established them at the plan level. 
Specifically, in § 423.120(a) of the 
regulation, which describes the 
requirements to assure pharmacy access, 
we inadvertently used the term ‘‘plans’’ 
instead of the correct terminology of 
PDP sponsor or other Part D sponsors. 
This error is problematic when 
considering the definitions outlined in 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 15:14 Oct 21, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22OCP2.SGM 22OCP2dc

§ 422.2 (for MA) and § 423.4 (for Part D) 
because the term ‘‘plan’’ is intended to 
mean a specific benefit package offered 
to beneficiaries living in a geographic 
area. For any given service area, Part D 
sponsors frequently offer multiple plans 
under one contract with CMS, and any 
given plan may be offered within a 
subset of the Part D sponsor’s total 
service area. 
Our intention has always been to 
ensure adequate access to Part D 
covered drugs at sponsor level, not at 
the plan level. For one, the statute 
explicitly states that access should be 
ensured at the PDP sponsor level. 
Further, assessing adequacy of 
pharmacy access is one of the most 
critical steps in the Part D application 
review process and determining access 
to Part D covered drugs at the plan level 
is not possible during application 
review. This is because plan service 
areas (potentially subsets of Part D 
sponsor or organization service areas) 
are not determined until the time of the 
bid submission, which occurs after 
applications are reviewed. However, 
sponsor service areas are known at the 
time of application submission. Our 
proposed correction would align our 
regulations with the intent of the statute 
with regard to the level of analysis that 
should be conducted for access to Part 
D drugs, namely at the Part D sponsor 
level, rather than at the plan level. 
We note that as a practical matter and 
consistent with the current drafting of 
the regulation, if the Part D sponsor’s 
entire service area is larger than one 
State, we will continue to ensure access 
at no greater than the State level for 
multi-state regions. This approach is 
necessary to ensure that pharmacies are 
not unduly clustered in one part of the 
region. Accordingly, based on the 
preceding rationale, we are proposing to 
revise the text of the regulation that 
discusses pharmacy access in 
§ 423.120(a)(10 through (a)(7) to refer to 
PDP sponsors, MA organizations 
offering local and regional MA–PD 
plans, and cost contracts rather than 
plans. Additionally, since § 423.120(a) 
(defining access requirements for Part D 
drugs) references a definition provided 
in § 423.112(a) (establishment of PDP 
service areas), it is necessary to correct 
the terminology in that location as well. 
Therefore, we propose to revise 
§ 423.112(a) to specify the establishment 
of service areas for PDP sponsors. 
9. Standard Timeframe and Notice 
Requirements for Coverage 
Determinations Under Part D (§ 423.568) 
Section 1860D–4(g) of the Act 
requires Part D plan sponsors to 
establish procedures for processing 
requests for coverage determinations 
and redeterminations. Those procedures 
must apply to Part D plan sponsors in 
the same manner as such requirements 
apply to MA organizations with respect 
to organization determinations and 
reconsiderations. In accordance with 
section 1860D–4(g) of the Act, § 423.568 
establishes the standard timeframe and 
notice requirements for coverage 
determinations. However, that section 
does not explain the method for filing 
such requests. We originally omitted 
these instructions from § 423.568 
because § 422.568 does not dictate the 
method for filing requests for standard 
organization determinations. However, 
elsewhere in this rule, we are proposing 
to revise § 422.568 of the MA 
regulations by adding a new paragraph 
(a) clarifying the method for filing 
requests for standard organization 
determinations. The proposal requires 
MA organizations to accept standard 
organization determination requests 
orally and in writing, except for 
standard requests for payment, which 
must be submitted in writing unless the 
MA organization adopts a voluntary 
policy of accepting oral payment 
requests. Because section 1860D–4(g) of 
the Act requires Part D plan sponsors to 
meet the requirements for Part D 
coverage determinations in the same 
manner as such requirements apply to 
MA organizations for organization 
determinations, we propose to make a 
corresponding change to § 423.568 and 
require Part D plan sponsors to accept 
standard coverage determination 
requests orally and in writing. This 
proposed change would not apply to 
standard requests for payment, which 
must be submitted in writing unless the 
plan sponsor adopts a policy for 
accepting those requests orally. 
In addition to this technical change, 
we propose to revise the timeframe for 
a Part D plan sponsor to notify an 
enrollee of a payment determination in 
§ 423.568(b). The regulation currently 
requires that a plan sponsor notify the 
enrollee of its determination no later 
than 72 hours after receipt of the 
request. We propose to revise the 
provision to require Part D plan 
sponsors to process requests for 
payment no later than 14 calendar days 
after receipt of the request, and also 
make payment no later than 14 calendar 
days after receiving the request when a 
plan sponsor’s decision is partially or 
fully favorable. 
As noted above, section 1860D–4(g) of 
the Act requires Part D plan sponsors to 
meet the requirements for Part D 
coverage determinations in the same 
manner as such requirements apply to 
MA organizations with respect to 
organization determinations. The MA 
regulations under § 422.568 distinguish 
between how requests for benefits not 
yet received and requests for payment 
are processed by MA plans. The rules 
pertaining to requests involving benefits 
not yet received are contained in 
paragraph (a), while paragraph (b) 
contains the rules for processing 
requests for payment. In accordance 
with section 1860D–4(g) of the Act, this 
distinction was carried over to Part D in 
current § 423.568(a) and (b). 
We received a comment on the 
Application of Certain Appeals 
Provisions to the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Appeals Process proposed rule (73 
FR 14342), published in the March 17, 
2008 Federal Register, recommending 
that we revise § 423.568(b) of the 
existing regulations by lengthening the 
timeframe for making standard coverage 
determinations involving requests for 
reimbursement submitted by enrollees. 
Although the comment was outside the 
scope of the Part D appeals-related 
proposals in the March 17, 2008 
proposed rule, we believe the 
commenter’s suggestion merits 
consideration, as discussed in detail 
below. 
The commenter contends that the 
existing 72-hour requirement for making 
a determination on an enrollee’s request 
for reimbursement constitutes an 
unprecedented and overly burdensome 
timeframe, and the only way a Part D 
plan sponsor can meet the regulatory 
timeframe is by making an adverse 
coverage determination (that is, deny 
the request for payment). Thus, the 
existing requirement in effect forces an 
enrollee into the Part D appeals process, 
even though in the vast majority of such 
situations, the claim will eventually be 
paid within the 30-day timeframe for 
effectuating a coverage determination. 
The commenter recommended that we 
revise § 423.568(b) to extend the 
timeframe for making a coverage 
determination on a request for payment 
from 72 hours to 30 days. 
As the commenter indicates, 
§ 423.568(b) sets forth the coverage 
determination and notification 
requirements in situations (generally 
involving non-network pharmacies) 
where an enrollee has already obtained 
a drug and subsequently makes a 
request to the Part D plan sponsor for 
payment. Existing § 423.568(b) requires 
a Part D plan sponsor to make this 
coverage determination and notify the 
enrollee of its determination no later 
than 72 hours after receiving such a 
payment request. Although the 
regulations do not specify a timeframe 
for making payment to the enrollee 
when the plan determines the drug in

question should be covered, plans are 
directed by manual guidance that such 
payment should be made within 30 days 
of the request. We note that the 30-day 
effectuation timeframe comports with 
the established requirements in 
§ 423.636 for effectuating 
redeterminations or reconsiderations 
involving requests for payment. It also 
generally parallels the prompt payment 
provisions that apply under § 422.520 
and § 422.568 of the MA program. 
The intent of these provisions was to 
ensure enrollees receive a prompt 
response to requests for payment while 
still giving plans a reasonable amount of 
time to process the payment. However, 
in practice, we agree that the 72-hour 
timeframe for making a coverage 
determination in these situations may 
be quite difficult for Part D plan 
sponsors to meet. Requests for 
reimbursement are generally submitted 
by mail in paper form, and must be 
identified as reimbursement requests, 
transferred from the mailroom to the 
reimbursement processing department, 
and then manually entered and 
adjudicated by Part D plan sponsors 
outside of the usual online real-time 
electronic claims processing procedures. 
We also note that under these 
circumstances, information that Part D 
plan sponsors need to make meaningful 
determinations with respect to a request 
(which is readily available on electronic 
claims) may be missing from the 
member-submitted paper claim. Finally, 
the Part D plan sponsor must notify the 
enrollee of its determination within 72 
hours. Thus, as the commenter asserts, 
in practice the only way to meet the 72- 
hour coverage determination timeframe 
often may be to make a negative 
coverage determination, at least 
initially, which is clearly not in the best 
interests of the enrollee. This initial 
negative determination can be 
particularly confusing to an enrollee in 
situations where a Part D plan sponsor 
subsequently determines that the 
reimbursement request should be paid 
and remits payment to the enrollee, 
frequently within a few days of the 
initial negative determination. 
As previously stated, the current 
regulations do not establish a timeframe 
for effectuating payment, and our 
manual guidance establishes a 30-day 
timeframe for doing so. Thus, even 
when a Part D plan sponsor completes 
the process above and issues a coverage 
determination within 72 hours, it is 
under no obligation to make payment 
any sooner than 30 calendar days after 
receiving the request. While we 
recognize that receiving Part D coverage 
decisions as soon as possible is 
important, an enrollee who is requesting 
reimbursement already has the needed 
prescription drug in hand. Thus, we 
believe it is more important for him or 
her to receive the actual payment as 
soon as possible, rather than simply a 
determination as to whether payment 
will or will not be made. 
Therefore, we believe it would be in 
the best interests of enrollees to modify 
the requirements of § 423.568(b) by 
extending the timeframe for making 
coverage determinations with respect to 
requests for payment in such a way as 
to avoid confusion but also ensure that 
enrollees receive payment as soon as 
possible. Based on our experience and 
previous discussions with Part D plan 
sponsors, we have determined that Part 
D sponsors generally are capable of 
making such payments within a 14-day 
period following receipt of a 
reimbursement request, as opposed to 
the 30-day period recommended by the 
commenter. Therefore, we propose 
revising § 423.568(b) to require Part D 
plan sponsors to take the following 
actions: (1) Make a coverage 
determination on a request for payment 
and notify the enrollee of its 
determination no later than 14 calendar 
days after receipt of a request for 
reimbursement, and (2) for favorable 
coverage determinations, make payment 
no later than 14 calendar days after 
receipt of the reimbursement request. 
We believe these changes will establish 
a more reasonable standard for the 
adjudication of paper claims, as well as 
ensure faster payments to enrollees who 
submit these requests. Thus, this change 
will better serve both plans and their 
members. As a result of changes 
proposed elsewhere in this rule, if 
adopted, these new requirements 
regarding the timeframe for processing 
requests for payment would appear at 
§ 423.568(c) of the regulations. 
Our last proposed change to § 423.568 
involves adding new paragraphs (d) and 
(e), which will explain the form and 
content of favorable coverage 
determination decisions. In 
§ 423.568(d), we propose requiring plan 
sponsors to send written notice of fully 
favorable decisions to enrollees. We also 
propose to allow plan sponsors the 
option of providing the initial notice 
orally so long as a written follow-up 
notice is sent to within 3 calendar days 
of the oral notification. In § 423.568(e), 
we propose to require notice of fully 
favorable decisions to include the 
conditions of the approval in a readable 
and understandable manner. 
Adding further requirements 
regarding the form and content of 
favorable determination decisions to the 
Part D regulations is necessary because 
prescription drugs are often provided to 
beneficiaries on a recurring basis (unlike 
most MA services which are generally 
provided to beneficiaries only once), 
and requiring plans to provide the terms 
of an approval in writing helps ensure 
continuity of care for Medicare 
beneficiaries who receive prescription 
drugs under Part D. The prescription 
may be subject to prior authorization or 
some other rule which needs to be met 
before a prescription can be refilled. 
Also, a prescription may only be 
approved for a specific period of time 
and refills may not be authorized. In 
those situations, it is important for the 
enrollee to know the conditions (for 
example, duration, limitations, and 
coverage rules for refills) of the approval 
before he or she needs to refill the 
prescription, so he or she can work with 
his or her physician to secure prior 
approval for additional refills, obtain an 
exception, or switch to an appropriate 
alternative prescription if necessary. 
Otherwise, the enrollee may experience 
a break in coverage if he or she attempts 
to fill a prescription and is told for the 
first time at the pharmacy that the 
prescription cannot be filled because it 
is subject to a coverage rule or 
additional refills have not been 
authorized. We believe the proposed 
changes to the notice requirements for 
favorable coverage determinations will 
help to ensure that enrollees and their 
physicians or other prescribers have the 
information they need in order maintain 
the continuity of prescription drug 
treatment. 
10. Expediting Certain Coverage 
Determinations (§ 423.570) 
Consistent with the proposed 
revisions to § 423.568, we propose to 
make a technical change to § 423.570 by 
revising the cross reference to 
§ 423.568(a) to § 423.568(b). 
11. Timeframes and Notice 
Requirements for Expedited Coverage 
Determinations (§ 423.572) 
In accordance with section 1860D– 
4(g) of the Act, § 423.572 establishes the 
timeframe and notice requirements for 
expedited coverage determinations. 
Section 423.572(c)(1) requires Part D 
plan sponsors to include the specific 
reasons for any expedited decision 
(whether favorable or adverse) in its 
decision notice, and paragraph (c)(2) 
addresses the content of adverse 
decision notices. However, § 423.572 
does not include any content 
requirements for favorable expedited 
decisions. Consistent with our rationale 
for adding form and content 
requirements for favorable standard 
coverage determination decisions, we 
believe form and content requirements

54697 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
for favorable expedited coverage 
determinations are important 
beneficiary protections that will help to 
ensure that enrollees are able to 
maintain continuity in their 
prescription drug treatment. Therefore, 
we propose to revise § 423.572(b) by 
requiring plan sponsors to send written 
notice of fully favorable expedited 
decisions to enrollees, and allowing 
plan sponsors the option of providing 
the initial notice orally so long as a 
written follow-up notice is sent to the 
enrollee within three calendar days of 
the oral notification. We also propose to 
add paragraph (c)(2), which requires 
notice of a fully favorable expedited 
decision to provide the conditions of the 
approval in a readable and 
understandable manner. 
We are also proposing in 
§ 423.572(c)(2)(i) to require plan 
sponsors to issue adverse expedited 
coverage determination decisions using 
CMS approved language in readable and 
understandable form. Section 
423.568(d) requires plan sponsors to use 
approved notices for adverse standard 
coverage determinations, and a parallel 
instruction for adverse standard and 
expedited coverage determinations is 
contained in subregulatory guidance. 
We developed Form CMS–10146 for use 
when plan sponsors issue adverse 
coverage determinations and, in our 
subregulatory guidance, we instruct 
plan sponsors to use that form when 
issuing adverse standard and expedited 
coverage determination decisions. Our 
proposed change in § 423.572(c)(2)(i) 
would reconcile this discrepancy in the 
regulations. We note that the proposed 
change does not create an additional 
burden for plan sponsors because 
sponsors already submit Form CMS– 
10146 to CMS for approval for adverse 
standard coverage determination 
decisions and, consistent with our 
subregulatory guidance, we expect plan 
sponsors to also use Form CMS–10146 
for adverse expedited coverage 
determination decisions. 
12. Clarify Novation Agreements Under 
Part D (§ 423.551) 
Section 1860D–12(b) (1) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
authority to enter into contracts with 
PDP sponsors. Additionally, section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(B) of the Act grants the 
Secretary the authority to amend or 
modify these contracts in accordance 
with the furtherance of the purpose of 
the Act. 
Consistent with the above-stated 
authority, we have implemented 
contracting regulations including 
§ 423.551 of the Part D regulations, 
which provide for the novation of a PDP 
sponsor contract in the event of a 
change of ownership involving a PDP 
sponsor. A change of ownership 
prompting the execution of a novation 
agreement is appropriate when a PDP 
sponsor is acquired or when it no longer 
can or wants to continue to participate 
in the PDP program. In the latter 
instance, a change of ownership can 
provide both the holder of the contract 
and CMS with an opportunity to 
transfer the ownership of the contract to 
a different entity with little or no 
disruption to the enrolled beneficiaries 
when the original entity faces 
difficulties (for example., financial, 
administrative) in operating its PDP 
contract. A change in ownership of the 
PDP line of business, which is 
recognized by CMS when we agree to a 
novation of the existing PDP sponsor 
contract, in this instance promotes the 
efficient and effective administration of 
the PDP program. 
However, over the past few years 
several PDP sponsors have requested 
CMS approval of transactions that 
involve the sale of a piece of the 
sponsor’s contract with CMS or less 
than the full line of PDP business [all 
PDP contracts held by that PDP 
sponsor]. For example, several PDP 
sponsors who have missed the LIS 
benchmark for a particular region 
requested to novate that portion of their 
contract to another PDP who met the 
benchmark in the region. 
However, our policy goals are not 
served when a sponsor is simply using 
the novation process to pick and choose 
which markets it wishes to serve at any 
given time and to profit from its exit 
from a given PDP region when a simple 
nonrenewal for that region is an option 
available to the sponsor. Novations are 
not intended to be an instrument for 
moving LIS beneficiaries when a 
particular sponsor has missed the 
benchmark. Rather, we have a 
reassignment process for moving LIS 
beneficiaries to sponsors who have met 
benchmark for the new contract year. 
Accordingly, we propose to revise 
§ 423.551 and add new paragraph 
§ 423.551(g) to restrict the situations in 
which we will agree to a PDP sponsor 
contract novation to those transfers 
involving the selling of the sponsor’s 
entire line of PDP business, which 
would include all PDP sponsor 
contracts held by the legal entity. We 
believe that allowing the spin-off of just 
one contract (when the PDP sponsor has 
more than one PDP contract) or pieces 
of a single contract can have a negative 
impact on beneficiary election rights. 
We are recommending becoming more 
prescriptive in this area because our 
experience gained over the first 4 years 
of the program indicates this is 
necessary for the reasons stated above. 
The proposed change would also create 
consistency between the MA program 
and the PDP program, because the MA 
program only allows novations that 
include the entire MA line of business 
(that is, all MA contracts held by a 
single legal entity). We invite comments 
from sponsors and the industry about 
this proposed change, and suggestions 
on other options which would 
accomplish the same policy goals. 
13. Cost Contract Program Revisions: 
Appeals and Marketing Requirements 
(§ 417.428, § 417.494, § 417.500, and 
§ 417.640) 
Although the cost contract program 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act and the health care prepayment 
plan (HCPP) programs authorized under 
section 1833 of the Act are based on 
reasonable costs, these programs have 
important elements in common with the 
MA program. As in the case of MA 
coordinated care plans, and unlike 
original Medicare, cost contractors 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act and HCPPs employ networks of 
providers and deliver services through a 
managed care model. However, unlike 
MA plans, enrollees under cost 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act and HCPPs are not ‘‘locked 
in’’ to their plans networks, and can 
always receive any service through 
Original Medicare if they pay original 
Medicare cost sharing. 
In the case of cost contracts 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act, the MA statute specifically 
recognized the parallels between 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act and MA contracts, providing 
in section 1856(b)(2) of the Act that MA 
standards ‘‘shall be based on standards 
established under section 1876 to carry 
out analogous provisions of such 
section.’’ Indeed, many of the original 
Part C regulations borrowed wholesale 
from the provisions in section 1876 of 
the Act and codified in Part 417. Using 
already established programs as the 
basis for new but related programs is 
common practice, one of the most recent 
examples of which is the Part D 
prescription drug benefit program. The 
MMA directed that fundamental aspects 
of the program, such as enrollment and 
payment polices, be similar to those of 
the MA program. 
There are several MA program 
requirements that we believe are 
appropriate to apply to cost contracts. In 
the case of contracts authorized under 
section 1876 of the Act, because section 
1876 of the Act contains similar 
statutory language to that in Part C for

MA contracts, this language provides 
clear authority to impose the same 
policies to both types of contracts. We 
have expressly done this in past 
regulations. For example, given the 
similarities between the statutory 
language in sections 1876(c)(5) and 
1852(g) of the Act, and the procedures 
for an independent review entity that 
existed in part 417 before Part C was 
enacted, we revised the part 417 
beneficiary appeals regulations 
governing cost contract appeals 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act simply to incorporate the Part C 
beneficiary appeals regulations in part 
422. MA contracts and cost contracts 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act similarly have had largely the same 
process concerning appeals of contract 
determinations, sanctions, and civil 
money penalties (CMPs). More recently, 
however, these processes have diverged, 
especially since the publication of final 
regulations revising the contract 
determination, sanctions, and CMP 
processes for MA organizations on 
December 5, 2007 (72 FR 68700 through 
68741). Similarly, the marketing 
requirements for cost contras, which at 
one time largely mirrored the MA 
requirements, have diverged. This is 
especially true since publication of our 
final regulations implementing 
significant changes to marketing 
standards, agent/broker compensation, 
and other marketing changes in 2008. 
As a result, there is sometimes 
confusion over which marketing 
requirements cost contract plans must 
follow. 
Therefore, we are proposing in this 
rule, under the authority under section 
1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act to impose ‘‘other 
terms and condition’’ under contracts 
authorized by the statute that the 
Secretary finds ‘‘necessary and 
appropriate,’’ and in implementation of 
the provisions authorized by section 
1876 of the Act set forth below, to apply 
the following MA program requirements 
to cost contracts authorized under 
section 1876 of the Act: 
• Under the authority in section 
1876(i)(1) of the Act to terminate or 
nonrenew contracts and the authority in 
section 1876(i)(6) of the Act to impose 
intermediate sanctions and CMPs, the 
MA program requirements on appeals 
processes for contract determinations 
and intermediate sanctions. (To the 
extent that the CMP in section 
1876(i)(6)(B) and (C) of the Act differ 
from those under Part C, the penalty 
amounts under section 1876 of the Act 
would continue to control); and 
• Under the authority in section 
1876(c)(3)(C) of the Act to regulate 
marketing of plans authorized under 
section 1876 of the Act and ensure that 
marketing material is not misleading, 
the MA program requirements for 
marketing to cost contract plans. 
We discuss the above proposals for 
cost contracts authorized under section 
1876 of the Act in greater detail in the 
sections that follow. 
14. Appeals Processes for Contract 
Determinations, Intermediate Sanctions, 
and Civil Money Penalties 
The policy reasons we gave in our 
December 2007 final rule for revising 
the contract determination and appeals 
processes for MA plans apply equally to 
cost contracts authorized under section 
1876 of the Act. By extending the MA 
and Part D requirements regarding these 
processes to cost contracts authorized 
under section 1876 of the Act and 
organizations that have both MA and 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act will also have a more efficient 
and clear path for appealing contract 
determinations, intermediate sanctions, 
and CMPs. 
We are proposing to revise the 
following sections of the current 
contract requirements provisions of Part 
417 authorized at section 1876 of the 
Act to specify that, with respect to 
appeals of contract determinations, 
intermediate sanctions and CMPs, cost 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act would follow the provisions 
applicable to MA organizations at, 
respectively, Subpart N and Subpart T 
of part 422. With respect to appeals of 
intermediate sanctions, we are 
proposing to revise § 417.500 of the cost 
contracts requirements authorized 
under section 1876 of the Act to make 
these consistent, with the exception of 
some CMP amount provisions, with the 
sanctions processes for MA 
organizations. We discuss the proposed 
changes below. 
a. Contract Determinations (§ 417.492 
and 417.494)) 
Previous to the implementation of the 
contract determination requirements in 
the December 2007 final rule, the cost 
contracts authorized under section 1876 
of the Act and MA plan contract 
determination requirements were very 
similar. Although we did not apply the 
provisions of the December 2007 
regulations to cost contracts authorized 
under section 1876 of the Act at that 
time, we believe that it makes sense to 
do so now for the same reasons we 
made changes to the MA processes at 
that time. 
As a result, we propose in 
§ 417.492(b)(2), concerning notice of 
appeal rights, and § 417.494, concerning 
notice of termination, to require cost 
contract plans to follow the contract 
determination appeal procedures under 
Subpart N of Part 422. 
b. Civil Money Penalties (§ 417.500) 
Currently, the regulations governing 
cost contracts authorized under section 
1876 of the Act do not set forth a formal 
process for appealing CMPs. We 
propose these plans would follow the 
same requirements for CMP appeals that 
MA organizations follow. As a result, 
we propose to revise § 417.500 to 
require cost contracts authorized under 
section 1876 of the Act to follow the MA 
programs requirements for appeals of 
CMPs at Subpart T of Part 422. The 
appeals process for CMPs specified at 
Subpart T allows for a hearing by an 
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and a 
review of the ALJ’s decision by the 
Departmental Appeals Board. In 
proposed new paragraph (c), we specify 
that the amount of CMPs a cost contract 
may be assessed is governed by section 
1876(i)(6)(B) of the Act, not by the 
provisions in part 422 of the MA 
program regulations. 
c. Intermediate Sanctions (§ 417.500) 
Our proposed revision to the cost 
contracts regulations authorized under 
section 1876 of the Act would ensure 
that these contracts follow the same 
requirements for intermediate sanctions 
appeals specified in § 422.750 through 
§ 422.764 of the MA program 
regulations (subpart O). 
These sections concern— 
• Types of intermediate sanctions and 
CMPs (§ 422.750); 
• Bases for intermediate sanctions 
and CMPs (§ 422.752); 
• Procedures for imposing 
intermediate sanctions and CMPs 
(§ 422.656); 
• Collection of CMPs (§ 422.758); 
• Settlement of penalties (§ 422.762); 
and 
• Other applicable provisions 
(§ 422.764). 
As noted above, with respect to 
determinations of the amount of CMPs, 
the provisions in section 1876(i)(6)(B) 
and (C) of the Act would govern such 
amounts. 
15. Extending MA Marketing 
Requirements to Cost Program Plans 
(§ 417.428) 
In 2008, we published several 
marketing-related regulations that 
significantly revised the marketing 
requirements for MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors. In the Medicare 
Advantage and Prescription Drug 
Benefit Programs; Final Marketing 
Provisions final rule, published in the 
September 18, 2008 Federal Register (73

54699 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
FR 54208 through 54223), we discussed 
exclusively the marketing and 
established marketing standards 
including prohibiting soliciting door-to- 
door or through other unsolicited means 
for Medicare beneficiaries. A second 
regulation, the Revisions to the 
Medicare Advantage and Prescription 
Drug Benefit Programs IFC, also 
published in the September 18, 2008 
Federal Register (73 FR 54226 through 
54254), added requirements limiting 
agent and broker commissions. A third 
regulation, the Revisions to the 
Medicare Advantage and Prescription 
Drug Benefit Programs; Clarification of 
Compensation Plans IFC, published in 
the November 14, 2008 Federal Register 
(73 FR 67406 through 67414), clarified 
and augmented the agent broker 
requirements as specified. The new 
marketing regulations resulted in the 
creation of a new subpart V in parts 422 
and 423. Although many of these 
provisions reflect or implement 
statutory provisions applicable only to 
MA plans and Part D plans, many of 
these same provisions were initially 
proposed under our broad authority to 
regulate marketing and impose new 
contract terms. As noted above, under 
this latter authority, we propose to 
amend § 417.428, which governs 1876 
cost contract program marketing 
requirements, to require cost contract 
plans to follow the MA marketing 
requirements in § 422.2260 et.seq. 
(Subpart V). We discuss the proposed 
marketing changes in the sections 
below. 
a. Definitions Concerning Marketing 
Materials (§ 422.2260) 
We are proposing that cost contracts 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act follow the same standards as MAOs 
under § 422.2260. Thus, cost contract 
plan marketing materials would include 
any materials which— 
• Promote the cost contract, or any 
cost contract plan offered by the cost 
contract; 
• Inform Medicare beneficiaries that 
they may enroll, or remain enrolled in, 
a cost contract plan offered by the cost 
contract; 
• Explain the benefits of enrollment 
in a cost contract plan, or rules that 
apply to enrollees; and 
• Explain how Medicare services are 
covered under a cost contact plan, 
including conditions that apply to such 
coverage. 
b. Review and Distribution of Marketing 
Materials (§ 422.2262) 
We propose that cost contracts 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act plan program marketing materials 
be subject to the same marketing review 
guidelines and timelines as MA plans at 
§ 422.2262. While section 1876(c)(3)(C) 
of the Act, like section 1851(h) of the 
Act, provides that marketing materials 
must be provided to CMS for review 
prior to use, and generally provides that 
such materials may be used after 45 
days if we do not disapprove them, 
section 1876(c)(3)(C) of the Act does not 
include the shorter, 10-day timeframe 
that applies under section 1851(h)(5) of 
the Act in the case of marketing 
materials using model language. 
However, we believe that as long as 
material is submitted to CMS prior to 
use, we can authorize use by an earlier 
timeframe than that provided for under 
the applicable statute, or for use under 
conditions established by CMS for 
‘‘deemed’’ approval under the file and 
use policy or as discussed in section 
II.G.15.d. of this proposed rule. 
Therefore, notwithstanding the 
differences in statutory language 
between sections 1876(c)(3)(C) and 
1851(h) of the Act, we propose that the 
part 417 marketing regulations be 
revised to provide that cost contracts 
plans authorized under section 1876 of 
the Act submit all such marketing 
materials to CMS at least 45 days before 
the date planned for distribution (10 
days if plans use CMS model language, 
without any modifications), and that file 
and use materials, as designated by CMS 
under the MA marketing regulations, 
may be released 5 days following their 
submission to CMS. 
c. Guidelines for CMS Review 
(§ 422.2264) 
In our proposal to apply the same 
standards to cost contract plans as 
currently applied to MAOs at 
§ 422.2264, cost contractors authorized 
under section 1876 of the Act would be 
required to comply with MA regulations 
that specify the information that cost 
contract plans must include in 
marketing materials, and specify that 
the cost contract plan must notify the 
general public concerning the plan’s 
enrollment period. Under section 
1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act, we also propose 
that in markets with a significant non- 
English speaking population, cost 
contract plans be required to provide 
materials in the language of these 
individuals. 
d. Deemed Approval (§ 422.2266) 
We propose to specify that if we have 
not disapproved the distribution of 
marketing materials or forms submitted 
by a cost contract plan in an area, we 
are deemed not to have disapproved the 
distribution in all other areas covered by 
the cost contract plan and cost contract 
except with regard to any portion of the 
material or form that is specific to the 
particular area, as provided under 
§ 422.2266. 
e. Standards for MA Organization 
Marketing (§ 422.2268) 
MA marketing standards we propose 
to extend to cost contract plans include 
the following provisions at § 422.2268: 
• Plans may not offer gifts to potential 
enrollees, unless the gifts are of nominal 
(as defined in the CMS Marketing 
Guidelines) value, are offered to all 
potential employees without regard to 
whether or not the beneficiary enrolls, 
and are not in the form of cash or other 
monetary rebates. 
• Plans may not market any health 
care-related product during a marketing 
appointment beyond the scope agreed 
upon by the beneficiary, and 
documented by the plan, prior to the 
appointment. 
• Plans may not market additional 
health-related lines of plan business not 
identified prior to an in-home 
appointment without a separate 
appointment that may not be scheduled 
until 48 hours after the initial 
appointment. 
• Plans may not use a plan name that 
does not include the plan type. The plan 
type should be included at the end of 
the plan name. 
f. Licensing of Marketing 
Representatives and Confirmation of 
Marketing Resources (§ 422.2272) 
As is the case currently for MAOs, we 
propose that cost contract plans 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act, consistent with § 422.2272: 
• Demonstrate to CMS’ satisfaction 
that marketing resources are allocated to 
marketing to the disabled Medicare 
population as well as beneficiaries age 
65 and over. 
• Establish and maintain a system for 
confirming that enrolled beneficiaries 
have, in fact, enrolled in the plan, and 
understand the rules applicable under 
the plan. 
• Employ as marketing 
representatives only individuals who 
are licensed by the State to conduct 
marketing activities (as defined in the 
Medicare Marketing Guidelines) in that 
State, and whom the cost program has 
informed that State it has appointed, 
consistent with the appointment process 
provided for under State law. 
g. Broker and Agent Requirements 
(§ 422.2274) 
Under section 1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act, 
we propose applying the MA limits on 
independent agent and broker 
compensation at § 422.2274 to 1876 cost 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 15:14 Oct 21, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22OCP2.SGM 22OCP2dc

contract plans. As with MA plans, 
compensation would be based on a 6- 
year compensation cycle. Agents and 
brokers would receive initial 
compensation (first year of the cycle) 
with compensation over each of the 
successive 5 years to be no more and no 
less than 50 percent of the initial 
aggregate compensation paid for the 
enrollment. If an enrollee moves to plan 
type distinct from the one in which he 
or she is currently enrolled, the agent/ 
broker would receive an initial 
commission and the cycle would begin 
anew. Distinct plan types include MA, 
MA–PD, PDP, and cost contract plans 
authorized under section 1876 of the 
Act. 
H. Changes To Implement Corrections 
and Other Technical Changes 
We propose six technical changes in 
this section outlined below.

1. Application of Subpart M to Health 
Care Prepayment Plans (§ 417.840) 
As part of the January 28, 2005 
Medicare Advantage (MA) final rule, we 
required cost plans (HMOs), including 
HCPPs, established under section 1876 
of the Act (Part E) and regulated under 
Part 417, to follow the MA appeals 
requirements in Subpart M of Part 422. 
While the MA beneficiary appeals 
provisions in section 1852(g) of the Act 
and cost-HMO–CMP beneficiary appeals 
provisions in section 1876(c)(5) of the 
Act do not apply to HCPP enrollees, 
HCPP enrollees retain the general right 
to appeal Medicare coverage decisions 
consistent with section 1869 of the Act. 
In applying the MA appeals procedures 
to HCPPs by regulation, we adapted and 
implemented section 1869 appeal rights 
in the HCPP context. The regulations 
implementing section 1869 for services 
received on a fee-for-service basis 
through original Medicare do not 
address the case of services furnished by 
an HCPP in the managed care context. 
Because HCPPs only provide Part B 
services, in our January 28, 2005 final 
rule (70 FR 4194), we limit the 
applicability of Subpart M to HCPP 
enrollees to only those provisions 
affecting Part B services. However, in 
doing so we inadvertently failed to 
include fast-track appeal rights 
regarding services provided by a (Part B) 
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
facility (CORF). The proposed revision 
corrects this oversight, and ensures that 
HCPP enrollees have access to fast-track 
appeals for CORF services furnished by 
an HCPP. This would also effectuate for 
HCPP enrollees the fast track appeal 
rights provided for under section 1869 
of the Act. 
2. Generic Notice Delivery 
Requirements (§ 422.622 and § 422.626) 
We propose making two technical 
revisions in § 422.622 and § 422.626 to 
ensure that the MA regulations 
accurately state when plans and 
providers are responsible for delivering 
certain notices to enrollees. Section 
422.622, states that when a QIO 
determines that an enrollee may remain 
in an inpatient setting, the MA 
organization must again provide the 
enrollee with a copy of the Important 
Message from Medicare (IM) when the 
enrollee no longer requires inpatient 
hospital care. However, the IM form 
instructions make clear that the IM is 
always delivered by a hospital. 
Similarly, in § 422.626, the current 
regulations make delivery of the Notice 
of Medicare Noncoverage (NOMNC) the 
MA organization’s responsibility. Again, 
the form instructions for the NOMNC 
clearly state that the notice is to be 
delivered by the provider. Accordingly, 
we propose replacing ‘‘MA 
organization’’ with ‘‘hospital’’ in 
§ 422.622, and ‘‘provider’’ in § 422.626. 
3. Revision to Definition of Gross 
Covered Prescription Drug Costs 
(§ 423.308) 
On January 12, 2009, we published a 
final rule (74 FR 1494) that included 
revisions to the definition of ‘‘gross 
covered prescription drug costs’’ in the 
Part D regulations at § 423.308. In 
amending § 423.308, we made a 
technical error in the definition of 
‘‘gross covered prescription drug costs’’ 
(74 FR 1545) by referencing ‘‘negotiated 
prices’’, the prices made available to 
Part D beneficiaries at network 
pharmacies, and not also referencing 
‘‘usual and customary prices’’, the 
prices for drugs purchased at out-of- 
network pharmacies. When we revised 
the definition of ‘‘gross covered 
prescription drug costs’’ our intent was 
to clarify that Part D sponsors must use 
the amount received by the dispensing 
pharmacy or other dispensing provider 
as the basis for determining the drug 
costs that must be reported to us. The 
use of the term ‘‘negotiated prices’’ as 
defined at § 423.100 (74 FR 1544) in the 
definition of ‘‘gross covered prescription 
drug costs’’ clarifies this requirement 
with regards to covered Part D drugs 
purchased at network pharmacies. 
However, by not also referencing ‘‘usual 
and customary prices’’ for covered Part 
D drugs purchased at out-of-network 
pharmacies, we inadvertently omitted 
from the definition of ‘‘gross covered 
prescription drug costs’’ the share of 
drug costs actually paid by Part D 
sponsors to out-of-network pharmacies. 
Section 1860D–15(b)(3) of the Act 
defines ‘‘gross covered prescription drug 
costs’’ as ‘‘the costs incurred under the 
[Part D] plan, not including 
administrative costs, but including costs 
directly related to the dispensing of 
covered part D drugs * * *.’’ These 
costs include costs incurred for covered 
Part D drugs at out-of-network 
pharmacies, as well as costs incurred at 
network pharmacies. Therefore, we are 
proposing to revise the definition of 
‘‘gross covered prescription drug costs’’ 
to correctly reference both ‘‘negotiated 
prices’’ paid to network pharmacies and 
‘‘usual and customary prices’’ paid to 
out-of-network pharmacies. Specifically,

54701 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
we are proposing to replace the term 
‘‘negotiated price’’ with the term ‘‘actual 
cost,’’ which is defined at § 423.100 as 
‘‘the negotiated price for a covered Part 
D drug when the drug is purchased at 
a network pharmacy, and the usual and 
customary price when a beneficiary 
purchases the drug at an out-of-network 
pharmacy consistent with § 423.124(a).’’ 
Thus, with this correction, the 
definition of gross covered prescription 
drug costs would include ‘‘the share of 
actual costs (as defined by § 423.100 of 
this part) actually paid by the Part D 
plan that is received as reimbursement 
by the pharmacy or other dispensing 
entity* * *.’’ 
4. Application Evaluation Procedures 
(§ 422.502(c) and (d) and § 423.503(c) 
and (d)) 
Section 1857(a) of the Act provides 
the Secretary with the authority to enter 
into contracts with MA organizations, 
and section 1860D–12(b) (1) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
authority to enter into contracts with 
PDP sponsors. Sections 422.502 and 
423.503 provide the evaluation and 
determination procedures for approving 
or denying a contract application. We 
are proposing two amendments to these 
regulations in § 422.502(c) and (d), and 
§ 423.503(c) and (d). 
Currently, § 422.502(c)(3)(iii) and 
§ 423.503(c)(3)(iii) state that if we deny 
the application, it gives written notice to 
the contract applicant indicating the 
applicant’s right to request 
reconsideration. In the December 5, 
2007 final rule, we modified the appeal 
rights for initial applications and 
eliminated the reconsideration process. 
However, in the final regulations we did 
not update § 422.502(c)(3)(iii) and 
§ 423.503(c)(3)(iii) to state that the 
applicant has a right to request a hearing 
and as a result the existing regulations 
incorrectly provide for a right to 
reconsideration. Therefore, at 
§ 422.502(c)(3)(iii) and 
§ 423.503(c)(3)(iii) we are proposing to 
make a technical correction and delete 
the language ‘‘right to reconsideration’’ 
and replace it with ‘‘right to request a 
hearing’’. 
Sections 422.502(d) and 423.503(d) 
currently provide that we have the 
ability to oversee the sponsoring 
organization’s continued compliance 
with the requirements and that if the 
sponsoring organization no longer meets 
those requirements, we will terminate 
the contract in accordance with 
§ 422.510 and § 423.509. This regulation 
is not an appropriate regulation for a 
section dedicated to the evaluation and 
determination procedures for approving 
or denying a contract application. 
Therefore, we are proposing to delete 
§ 422.502(d) and § 423.503(d). The 
deletion of this language should not in 
any way be interpreted as limiting our 
ability to oversee a sponsoring 
organization’s compliance with our 
requirements as outlined at § 422.504 
and § 423.505 or our ability to terminate 
a contract when a sponsoring 
organization no longer meets 
requirements as outlined in § 422.510(a) 
and § 423.509(a). 
5. Intermediate Sanctions (§ 422.750(a) 
and § 423.750(a)) 
Sections 1857(g) and 1860D–12 of the 
Act provide the Secretary the ability to 
impose intermediate sanctions on 
sponsoring organizations. Section 
422.750 and § 423.750 provide the types 
of intermediate sanctions that we may 
impose. Those intermediate sanctions 
are suspension of enrollment, 
suspension of payment, and suspension 
of all marketing activities. We are 
proposing to make technical changes to 
each intermediate sanction regulation to 
more accurately reflect the statute. 
We are first proposing to change 
§ 422.750(a)(1) and § 423.750(a)(1), 
which currently state that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction that 
requires the suspension of enrollment of 
Medicare beneficiaries. This regulation, 
as currently written, does not 
adequately reflect the statutory language 
which specifies that the enrollment 
suspension applies to the sponsoring 
organization’s enrollment of Medicare 
beneficiaries. Therefore, we are 
proposing to amend § 422.750(a)(1) and 
§ 423.750(a)(1) to add language which 
makes it explicit that the suspension of 
enrollment applies to suspension of the 
sponsoring organization’s enrollment of 
Medicare beneficiaries . 
We also are proposing to change the 
language of § 422.750(a)(2) and 
§ 423.750(a)(2), which currently states 
that we may impose a suspension of 
payment to the sponsoring organization 
for Medicare beneficiaries who are 
enrolled in the MA plan. This language 
does not conform to the statutory 
language at section 1857(g)(2)(C) of the 
Act which states suspension of payment 
may be imposed for individuals 
enrolled after the date the Secretary 
notifies the organization of the 
imposition of an intermediate sanction. 
Therefore, we are amending 
§ 422.750(a)(2) and § 423.750(a)(2) to 
add language that specifically states a 
suspension of payment applies to 
Medicare beneficiaries enrolled after the 
date we notify the organization of the 
intermediate sanction. 
We are also proposing changes to 
§ 422.750(a)(3) and § 423.750(a)(3), 
which currently states that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction that 
requires the suspension of all marketing 
activities to Medicare beneficiaries by a 
sponsoring organization for specified 
MA or Part D ‘‘plans.’’ The use of the 
words ‘‘for specified’’ MA or Part D 
‘‘plans’’ does not conform to the 
statutory language that applies 
intermediate sanctions at the 
organization level. Therefore, we are 
amending § 422.750(a)(3) and 
§ 423.750(a)(3) to conform to the 
statutory language by deleting the words 
‘‘for specified MA or Part D plans.’’ 
6. Basis for Imposing Intermediate 
Sanctions and Civil Money Penalties 
(§ 422.752 and § 423.752) 
Sections 1857(g) and 1860D–12 of the 
Act provide a list of bases for 
intermediate sanctions and civil money 
penalties. Existing regulations at 
§ 422.752(a) and § 423.752(a) provide a 
similar list of bases for intermediate 
sanctions and civil money penalties. 
However, the language provided in 
§ 422.752(a)(1), (3), and (4) and 
§ 423.752(a)(1), (3), and (4) does not 
adequately conform to the statutory 
language in section 1857(g)(1)(A), (C), 
and (D) of the Act, respectively. 
Specifically, section 1857(g)(1) of the 
Act states the Secretary may impose an 
intermediate sanction if it determines 
that the sponsoring organization: (A) 
Fails substantially to provide medically 
necessary items and services that are 
required (under law or under the 
contract) to be provided to an individual 
covered under the contract, if the failure 
has adversely affected (or has 
substantial likelihood of adversely 
affecting) the individual; (C) acts to 
expel or to refuse to re-enroll an 
individual in violation of the provisions 
of this part; and (D) engages in any 
practice that would reasonably be 
expected to have the effect of denying 
or discouraging enrollment (except as 
permitted by this part) by eligible 
individuals with the organization whose 
medical condition or history indicates a 
need for substantial future medical 
services. To ensure accuracy, 
consistency and uniformity we are 
making conforming changes to our 
regulation at § 422.752(a)(1), (3), and (4) 
and § 423.752(a)(1), (3), and (4) to more 
accurately reflect the statutory language. 
First, § 422.752(a)(1) states that we 
may impose an intermediate sanction if 
the sponsoring organization fails 
substantially to provide, to a sponsoring 
organization enrollee, medically 
necessary services that the organization 
is required to provide (under law or 
under the contract) to a sponsoring 
organization enrollee, and that failure

adversely affects (or is substantially 
likely to adversely affect) the enrollee. 
This language is slightly different than 
the language provided in the statute at 
section1857(g)(1)(A) of the Act. 
Therefore, we are proposing to amend 
§ 422.752(a)(1) and § 423.752(a)(1) to 
conform with the statutory language and 
state that we may impose an 
intermediate sanction if the sponsoring 
organization fails substantially to 
provide medically necessary items and 
services that are required (under law or 
under the contract) to be provided to an 
individual covered under the contract, if 
the failure has adversely affected (or has 
substantial likelihood of adversely 
affecting) the individual 
Second, § 422.752(a)(3) and 
§ 423.752(a)(3) states that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction if the 
sponsoring organization expels or 
refuses to reenroll a beneficiary in 
violation of the provisions of this part. 
This language does not include the 
word ‘‘acts’’ to expel which is 
mentioned in the statute at section 
1857(g)(1)(C) of the Act. Therefore, we 
are proposing to amend § 422.752(a)(3) 
and § 423.752(a)(3) to conform with the 
statutory language and state that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction if the 
sponsoring organization ‘‘acts’’ to expel 
or refuses to re-enroll a beneficiary in 
violation of the provisions of this part. 
Third, § 422.752(a)(4) and 
§ 423.752(a)(4) states that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction if the 
sponsoring organization engages in any 
practice that could reasonably be 
expected to have the effect of denying 
or discouraging enrollment of 
individuals whose medical condition or 
history indicates a need for substantial 
future medical services. This language 
does not match the exact language 
contained in section 1857(g)(1)(D) of the 
Act. Therefore, we are proposing to 
amend § 422.752(a)(4) and 
§ 423.752(a)(4) to conform with the 
statutory language and state that we may 
impose an intermediate sanction if the 
sponsoring organization engages in any 
practice that would reasonably be 
expected to have the effect of denying 
or discouraging enrollment (except as 
permitted by this part) by eligible 
individuals with the organization whose 
medical condition or history indicates a 
need for substantial future medical 
services. 
We are also proposing to make 
conforming changes to § 422.752(c) and 
§ 423.752(c). Currently § 422.752(c)(1) 
and § 423.752(c)(1) state that we may 
impose civil money penalties for any of 
the determinations at § 422.510(a) and 
§ 423.509(a), except § 422.510(a)(4) and 
§ 423.509(a)(4). Also, § 422.752(c)(2)(ii) 
and § 423.752(c)(2)(ii) state that OIG 
may impose civil money penalties for a 
determination made pursuant to 
§ 422.510(a)(4) and § 423.509(a)(4). 
Since we are proposing elsewhere in 
these proposed regulations to 
redesignate § 422.510(a)(4) and 
§ 423.509(a)(4) to § 422.510(a)(2)(iii) and 
§ 423.509(a)(2)(iii), we need to conform 
§ 422.752 and § 423.752 to these 
changes. Therefore, for regulations 
§ 422.752(c)(1), § 422.752(c)(2)(ii), 
§ 423.752(c)(1), and § 423.752(c)(2)(ii) 
we are proposing to delete the reference 
to § 422.510(a)(4) and § 422.509(a)(4) 
and replace them with a reference to 
§ 422.510(a)(2)(iii) and 
§ 423.509(a)(2)(iii). 
III. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, we are required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection 
should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we 
solicit comment on the following issues: 
• The need for the information 
collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
• The accuracy of our estimate of the 
information collection burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of these issues for the following 
sections of this document that contain 
information collection requirements 
(ICRs): 
A. ICRs Regarding Basic Contract 
Requirements (§ 417.472) 
Proposed § 417.472(i) states that HMO 
or CMP must comply with the 
requirements at § 422.152(b)(5). 
Proposed § 417.472 states that all 
coordinated care contracts (including 
local and regional PPOs and contracts 
with exclusively SNP benefit packages, 
cost contracts under section 1876 of the 
Act, private fee-for-service contracts, 
and MSA contracts with 600 or more 
enrollees in July of the prior year) must 
contract with approved Medicare 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey 
vendors to conduct the Medicare 
CAHPS satisfaction survey of MA plan 
enrollees in accordance with CMS 
specifications and submit the survey 
data to CMS. The burden associated 
with the requirement in § 417.472(i) and 
(j) is detailed in our discussion of 
§ 422.152(b)(5). 
B. ICRs Regarding Apportionment and 
Allocation of Administrative and 
General Costs (§ 417.564) 
We are not imposing any new 
reporting requirements. We are simply 
clarifying what costs an HCPP may 
report in its cost report as 
administrative costs for reimbursement 
from the government. We do not believe 
that our proposal will result in 
additional burden on cost plans; 
therefore, we have not incorporated a 
burden increase in the PRA section. 
However, we solicit comment on our 
burden estimates. 
C. ICRs Regarding Medicare Secondary 
Payer (MSP) Procedure (§ 422.108 and 
§ 423.462) 
Section 422.108(b)(3) proposes that 
MA organizations must coordinate 
benefits to Medicare enrollees with the 
benefits of the primary payers, 
including reporting, on an ongoing 
basis, information obtained in 
accordance with requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section in accordance with CMS 
instructions. Similarly, § 423.462 
proposed that Part D plan sponsors must 
report creditable new or changed 
primary payer information to the CMS 
Coordination of Benefits Contractor in 
accordance with the processes and 
timeframes specified by CMS. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time and effort necessary to report 
the specified information to CMS on an 
ongoing basis. We estimate that 624 MA 
organizations and 456Part D plan 
sponsors must comply with these 
requirements, a total of 1,080 entities. 
We also estimate that, on average, each 
entity will produce one report thereby 
yielding a total of 1,080 reports annually 
for involved entities. It will take each 
entity an average of 2,885 hours to 
report the required information to CMS. 
The estimated annual burden associated 
with these requirements is 3,115,800 
hours. The cost associated with meeting 
these requirements is $77.9 million. 
D. ICRs Regarding Disclosure 
Requirements (§ 422.111) 
Proposed § 422.111 states that we may 
require an MA organization to self- 
disclose to its enrollees or potential 
enrollees, the MA organization’s 
performance and contract compliance 
deficiencies in a manner specified by 
CMS. The burden associated with this 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 15:14 Oct 21, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22OCP2.SGM 22OCP2dc

54703 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
requirement is the time and effort 
necessary for an MA organization to 
make the aforementioned disclosures. 
We have not accounted for the burden 
associated with this provision for two 
reasons. First, we may require 
organizations that are under 
enforcement actions to disclose their 
compliance deficiencies in a letter to 
their existing members. However, the 
number of organizations that receive 
enforcement actions per year does not 
exceed the PRA threshold of 10. Based 
on past history and experience, we have 
not imposed intermediate sanctions on 
more than 10 plans in a given year. For 
example, there have been a total of 4 
organizations with intermediate 
sanctions imposed this year which is 
the highest number of intermediate 
sanctions imposed during the past 4 
years. Second, for organizations that are 
not under enforcement action, we may 
require them to disclose compliance and 
performance deficiencies but only in 
their existing marketing or enrollment 
materials sent to current and potential 
enrollees. There will be no requirement 
for them to submit additional materials 
to enrollees. We solicit comment on 
whether these provisions could impact 
10 or more plans and whether these 
burdens should be accounted for under 
the PRA. 
E. ICRs Regarding Quality Improvement 
Program (§ 422.152) 
Proposed § 422.152(b)(3)(ii) states that 
MA coordinated care plans must collect, 
analyze and report quality performance 
data indentified by CMS that are of the 
same type as those specified under 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The 
burden associated with these 
requirements is the time and effort 
necessary for an MA coordinated care 
plan to collect, analyze and report 
quality performance data to CMS. We 
estimate that it will require 1,000 hours 
per MA coordinated care plan to comply 
with these requirements. There are 624 
MA coordinated care plans. The 
estimated annual burden associated 
with these requirements is 624,000 
hours. The estimated annual cost 
associated with these requirements is 
$36.9 million. 
Proposed § 422.152(b)(5) requires that 
all coordinated care contracts (including 
local and regional PPOs and contracts 
with exclusively SNP benefit packages, 
cost contracts under section 1876 of the 
Act, private fee-for-service contracts, 
and MSA contracts with 600 or more 
enrollees in July of the prior year) must 
contract with approved Medicare 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey 
vendors to conduct the Medicare 
CAHPS satisfaction survey of MA plan 
enrollees in accordance with CMS 
specifications, and submit the survey 
data to CMS. The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary to conduct the CAHPS 
survey and submit the corresponding 
data to CMS. While this requirement is 
subject to the PRA, the associated 
burden is currently approved under 
OMB control number 0938–0732. 
Proposed § 422.152(e)(2)(ii) states that 
MA organizations offering an MA 
regional plan or local PPO plan must 
collect, analyze and report quality 
performance data identified by CMS 
that are of the same type as those 
described under § 422.152(e)(2)(i). The 
burden associated with these 
requirements is the time and effort 
necessary for an MA organization 
offering an MA regional plan or local 
PPO plan to collect, analyze and report 
quality performance data to CMS. We 
estimate that it will require 54 hours per 
MA organization to comply with these 
requirements; there are 509 
organizations offering an MA regional 
plan or local PPO. The estimated annual 
burden associated with these 
requirements is 27,486 hours. The 
estimated annual cost associated with 
these requirements is $3.1 million. 
F. ICRs Regarding RADV Audit Dispute 
and Appeal Processes (§ 422.311) 
Proposed § 422.311(c)(1) discusses the 
attestation process with regard to the 
RADV audit dispute and appeal 
processes. Specifically, proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(1)(i)(A) states that 
subsequent to the conduct of a RADV 
audit, MA organizations may submit 
CMS-generated attestations from 
physician/practitioner(s) in order to 
dispute signature or credential related 
RADV errors. Proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(1)(iv)(A) states that CMS 
notifies an MA organization of their 
RADV audit status, we will provide the 
attestation forms and submission 
instructions. As stated in proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(1)(iv)(B), MA organizations 
are required to submit the attestation to 
CMS at the same time that the MA 
organization is required to submit 
related medical records for RADV 
audits. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements in this section is the time 
and effort necessary for MA 
organizations to complete the CMS- 
generated attestations and to submit the 
related documentation to CMS. While 
these requirements are subject to the 
PRA, we believe the associated burden 
is exempt from the PRA under 5 CFR 
1320.3(h)(1). As stated in 5 CFR 
1320.3(h)(1), information does not 
generally include items in the following 
categories, which include but are not 
limited to affidavits, oaths, affirmations 
and certifications, provided that they 
entail no burden other than that 
necessary to identify the respondent, the 
date, the respondent’s address, and the 
nature of the instrument. Similarly, we 
believe the burden associated with the 
aforementioned information collection 
requirements is exempt from the PRA 
under 5 CFR 1320.4. Information 
collected during the conduct of an 
administrative action or audit is not 
subject to the PRA. 
Proposed § 422.311(c)(2) states that an 
MA organization may choose to dispute 
CMS’ operational processing of RADV 
medical records using a CMS- 
administered documentation dispute 
process. 
Proposed § 422.311(c)(2)(iii)(B) states 
that MA organizations have 30 days 
from the date of issuance of the RADV 
audit report to request a documentation 
dispute. Proposed § 422.311(c)(2)(iv) 
outlines the documentation dispute 
review and notification procedures. The 
burden associated with the 
requirements in this section is the time 
and effort necessary for an MA 
organization to request a documentation 
dispute. While this requirement is 
subject to the PRA, we believe the 
associated burden is exempt under 5 
CFR 1320.4. Information collected 
during the conduct of an administrative 
action or audit is not subject to the PRA. 
Proposed § 422.311(c)(3) describes the 
RADV payment error appeal process. 
Specifically, proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(3)(iii) states that at the time 
CMS issues its RADV audit report, we 
notify affected MA organizations in 
writing of their appeal rights around the 
RADV payment error calculation. The 
MA organizations have 30 days from the 
date of this notice to submit a written 
request for reconsideration of its RADV 
payment error calculation. The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and effort necessary for an MA 
organization to draft and submit a 
redetermination request that contains 
the content specified in proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(3)(v). While this 
requirement is subject to the PRA, we 
believe the associated burden is exempt 
under 5 CFR 1320.4. Information 
collected during the conduct of an 
administrative action or audit is not 
subject to the PRA. 
Proposed § 422.311(c)(4) states that an 
MA organization that is dissatisfied 
with the written decision of the CMS 
reconsideration official is entitled to a 
hearing as provided in this section. The 
organization’s request for a hearing must 
be made in writing and filed with CMS

within 30 days of the date CMS and the 
MA organization receive CMS’ written 
reconsideration decision. The 
reconsideration request must contain 
the information listed in proposed 
§ 422.311(c)(4)(ii). The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and effort necessary for an MA 
organization to draft and submit a 
hearing request. While this requirement 
is subject to the PRA, we believe the 
associated burden is exempt under 5 
CFR 1320.4. Information collected 
during the conduct of an administrative 
action or audit is not subject to the PRA. 
G. ICRs Regarding Application 
Requirements (§ 422.501 and § 423.502) 
Proposed § 422.501(b) and proposed 
§ 423.502(b) require that an organization 
submitting an application under this 
section for a particular contract year 
must first submit a completed Notice of 
Intent to Apply by the date established 
by CMS. We will not accept 
applications from organizations that do 
not submit a timely Notice of Intent to 
Apply. The purpose of these 
requirements is to facilitate CMS 
systems access earlier so that the 
contract number may be given out and 
applications may be submitted 
electronically. While the burden 
associated with the requirements 
contained in proposed § 422.501(b) and 
proposed § 423.502(b), the Notice of 
Intent to Apply, is subject to the PRA, 
the burden associated with these 
requirements is already approved under 
the OMB control numbers for the Part C 
and Part D applications, 0938–0935 and 
0938–0936, respectively. 
Section 422.501(c) and § 423.502(c) 
propose to revise the current regulation, 
making clear the application standards 
for becoming an MA organization or 
Part D plan sponsor. Specifically, 
proposed § 422.501(c) and § 423.502(c) 
would require that applicants complete 
all parts of a certified application. The 
burden associated with the 
aforementioned requirements is the time 
and effort necessary for an applicant to 
complete all parts of a certified Part C 
or Part D application. While the burden 
associated with the requirements 
contained in proposed § 422.501(c) and 
proposed § 423.502(c) is subject to the 
PRA, the burden associated with these 
requirements is already approved under 
OMB control numbers for the Part C and 
Part D applications, 0938–0935 and 
0938–0936, respectively. 
The costs associated with submitting 
the applications approved under 0938– 
0935 and 0938–0936 are $864,600 and 
$655,559, for MA plans and Part D plan 
sponsors, respectively. 
H. ICRs Regarding General Provisions 
(§ 422.503 and § 423.504) 
Section 422.503(b)(4)(vi) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi) propose to expand on 
the existing requirements by providing 
clarification and additional guidance 
with respect to the requirements for 
developing, implementing and 
maintaining effective compliance 
programs. We believe the requirements 
contained in § 422.503(b)(4)(vi) and 
§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi) will assist sponsoring 
organizations further improving their 
existing compliance programs. While 
these requirements are subject to the 
PRA, we believe the associated burden 
is part of usual and customary business 
practices and thereby exempt under 5 
CFR 1320.3(b)(2). However, we solicit 
comment on our assessment and 
whether these burdens are, in fact, part 
of usual and customary business 
practices. 
I. ICRs Regarding Contract Provisions 
(§ 422.504 and 423.505) 
Proposed § 422.504 and § 423.505 
explicitly state our existing authority to 
find sponsors out of compliance with 
either MA requirements, Part D 
requirements, or both when the 
sponsor’s performance represents an 
outlier relative to the performance of 
other sponsors. Specifically, proposed 
§ 422.504(e)(2) and § 423.505(e)(2) state 
that HHS, the Comptroller General or 
their designees have the right to audit, 
evaluate, and inspect any books, 
contracts, computer or other electronic 
systems, including medical records and 
documentation of the first tier, 
downstream, and related to our contract 
with the MA organization. These 
proposed sections contain 
recordkeeping requirements. The 
burden associated with proposed 
§ 422.504(e)(2) and § 423.505(e)(2) is the 
time and effort necessary for MA 
organizations or Part D sponsors to 
maintain the information on file and 
make it available to CMS upon request. 
While these requirements are subject to 
the PRA, we believe the associated 
burden is exempt under 5 CFR 
1320.3(b)(2). However, we solicit 
comment on our assessment and 
whether these burdens are, in fact, part 
of usual and customary business 
practices. 
J. ICRs Regarding Nonrenewal of 
Contract (§ 422.506 and § 423.507) 
Proposed § 422.506 and § 423.507 
contain notification requirements for 
MA organizations and Part D plan 
sponsors. Section 422.506(a)(2) and 
§ 423.507(a)(2) propose to require that 
when an organization does not intend to 
renew its contract, it must notify each 
Medicare enrollee by mail at least 90 
calendar days before the date on which 
the nonrenewal is effective. An 
organization would also have to provide 
information about alternative 
enrollment options by complying with 
at least one of the requirements 
specified in proposed § 422.506(a)(2)(ii) 
or § 423.507(a)(2)(ii). In addition, 
proposed § 422.506(b)(2) and 
§ 423.507(b)(2) state that an organization 
notify each Medicare enrollee by mail at 
least 90 calendar days before the date on 
which the nonrenewal is effective, or at 
the conclusion of the appeals process if 
applicable. 
The burden associated with the 
aforementioned requirements is the time 
and effort necessary for an organization 
to notify its Medicare enrollees by mail 
at least 90 calendar days before the date 
on which the nonrenewal is effective, or 
at the conclusion of the appeals process 
if applicable. While this requirement is 
subject to the PRA, we are unable to 
accurately quantify the burden because 
we cannot estimate the number of 
organizations that may not renew their 
contracts from year to year. We believe 
that less than 10 contracts will be 
terminated on an annual basis; however, 
we welcome public comments on these 
information collection requirements and 
whether the PRA would apply. We will 
reevaluate this issue in the final rule 
stage of rulemaking. 
K. ICRs Regarding Request for Hearing 
(§ 422.662 and § 423.651) 
With respect to Medicare contract 
determinations and appeals, § 422.662 
and § 423.651 propose the requirements 
for submission methods and time for 
filing requirements for MA 
organizations and Part D plan sponsors 
that want to request a hearing for a 
determination under appeal. The 
request for hearing must be submitted in 
writing and must be filed within 15 
calendar days after the receipt of the 
notice of the contract determination or 
intermediate sanction. The PRA is not 
applicable to this proposal because 
there are no additional requirements for 
sponsoring organizations. This is an 
existing regulation and we are only 
modifying the language ‘‘after receipt of 
the hearing decision’’ to conform to 
other regulations. 
L. ICRs Regarding Time and Place of 
Hearing (§ 422.670 and § 423.655) 
Proposed § 422.670 and § 423.655 
state that CMS, an MA organization or 
a Part D plan sponsor may request an 
extension by filing a written request no 
later than 5 calendar days prior to the 
scheduled hearing. The burden

54705 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
associated with these requirements is 
the time and effort necessary for an MA 
organization or a Part D plan sponsor to 
submit a written extension request to 
the presiding hearing officer. While this 
requirement is subject to the PRA, we 
believe the associated burden is exempt 
from the PRA as stated under 5 CFR 
1320.4. Information collected during the 
conduct of an administrative action is 
not subject to the PRA. 
M. ICRs Regarding Review by the 
Administrator (§ 422.692 and § 423.666) 
Proposed § 422.692 and § 423.666 
state that CMS, an MA organization or 
a PDP plan sponsor that has received a 
hearing decision may request a review 
by the Administrator within 15 calendar 
days after receipt of the hearing 
decision. The burden associated with 
these requirements is the time and effort 
necessary to submit a request for the 
Administrator to review a hearing 
decision. The PRA is not applicable to 
this proposal because there are no 
additional requirements for sponsoring 
organizations. This is an existing 
regulation and we are only modifying 
the language ‘‘after receipt of the 
hearing decision’’ to conform to other 
regulations. 
N. ICRs Regarding Procedures for 
Imposing Intermediate Sanctions and 
Civil Monetary Penalties (§ 422.756 and 
§ 423.756) 
Proposed § 422.756 and § 423.756 
state before CMS imposes intermediate 
sanctions, MA organizations and Part D 
plan sponsors may request a hearing 
before a CMS hearing officer. A written 
request must be received by the 
designated CMS office within 15 
calendar days of the receipt of the notice 
of sanction. The burden associated with 
these requirements is the time and effort 
necessary to draft and submit a hearing 
request to the designated CMS office. 
The PRA is not applicable to this 
proposal because there are no additional 
requirements for sponsoring 
organizations. This is an existing 
regulation and we are only modifying 
the language ‘‘after receipt of the 
hearing decision’’ to conform to other 
regulations. 
O. ICRs Regarding Disclosure of Part D 
Plan Information (§ 423.128) 
Proposed § 423.128 states that we may 
require a Part D plan sponsor to self- 
disclose to its enrollees or potential 
enrollees, the Part D plan sponsor’s 
performance and contract compliance 
deficiencies in a manner specified by 
CMS. We believe the burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary for a Part D plan 
sponsor to disclose the aforementioned 
information. We do not believe the PRA 
is applicable for this proposal for two 
reasons. 
First, we may require organizations 
that are under enforcement actions to 
disclose their compliance deficiencies 
in a letter to their existing members. 
Based on past history and experience, 
we have not imposed intermediate 
sanctions on more than 10 plans in a 
given year. For example, there have 
been a total of 4 organizations with 
intermediate sanctions imposed this 
year which is the highest number of 
intermediate sanctions imposed during 
the past 4 years. We believe the burden 
associated with the requirement is not 
subject to the PRA under 5 CFR 
1320.3(c), which defines the agency 
collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the PRA as information 
collection imposed on 10 or more 
persons within any 12-month period. 
This information collection does not 
impact 10 or more entities in a 12- 
month period. However, we welcome 
public comments on this issue. We will 
reevaluate this issue in the final rule 
stage of rulemaking. 
Second, for organizations that are not 
under enforcement action, we may 
require them to disclose compliance and 
performance deficiencies but only in 
their existing marketing or enrollment 
materials sent to current and potential 
enrollees. 
While we do not believe this 
additional disclosure would increase 
burden or costs to organizations, we 
solicit comment on our burden 
estimates and assumptions. 
P. ICRs Regarding Consumer 
Satisfaction Surveys (§ 423.156) 
Proposed § 423.156 requires Part D 
contracts with 600 or more enrollees as 
of July of the prior year to contract with 
approved Medicare Consumer 
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and 
Systems (CAHPS) survey vendors to 
conduct the Medicare CAHPS 
satisfaction survey of Part D plan enroll 
enrollees in accordance with CMS 
specifications and submit the survey 
data to CMS. The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary to conduct the CAHPS 
survey and submit the corresponding 
data to CMS. While this requirement is 
subject to the PRA, the associated 
burden is currently approved under 
OMB control number 0938–0732. 
Q. ICRs Regarding Validation of Part C 
and Part D Reporting Requirements 
(§ 422.516 and § 423.514) 
We propose to amend § 422.516 and 
§ 423.514 to state that each Part C and 
Part D sponsor be subject to an 
independent yearly audit of Part C and 
Part D measures (collected pursuant to 
our reporting requirements) to 
determine their reliability, validity, 
completeness, and comparability in 
accordance with specifications 
developed by CMS. The burden 
associated with this proposed provision 
is the time and effort of the MA 
organizations and Part D sponsors in 
procuring an auditor and in supporting 
the auditor as well as the time and effort 
of the auditor in conducting the yearly 
audit. We estimate that the total yearly 
hourly burden for procuring and 
supporting the auditor is equal to the 
number of sponsors (710) × the average 
estimated hours per sponsor (120). This 
equals 85,200 hours. We estimated that 
the average number of hours for the 
auditor to conduct an audit was 304. 
The total estimated hours to conduct 
audits across all sponsors would then be 
710 × 304 = 215, 840. The total hours 
would be 85,200 + 215,840 = 301,040. 
The estimated annual cost associated 
with these requirements is $45.6 
million. 
R. ICRs Regarding Drug Utilization 
Management, Quality Assurance, and 
Medication Therapy Management 
Programs (MTMPs) (§ 423.153) 
The proposed revisions to § 423.153 
state that Part D plans must offer a 
minimum level of medication therapy 
management services for each 
beneficiary enrolled in the MTMP that 
includes but is not limited to annual 
comprehensive medication reviews with 
written summaries. The comprehensive 
medical review must include an 
interactive, person-to-person 
consultation performed by a pharmacist 
or other qualified provider unless the 
beneficiary is in a long-term care setting. 
Additionally, there must by quarterly 
targeted medication reviews with 
follow-up interventions when 
necessary. 
The burden associated with these 
requirements is the time and effort 
necessary for a Part D sponsors (both 
MA–PDs and PDPs) to conduct the 
medical reviews with written 
summaries. We estimate that each 
medical review will take an average of 
30 minutes to conduct. Similarly, we 
estimate that there will be 1,875,000 
reviews conducted by 456 Part D 
sponsors on an annual basis. The total 
annual burden associated with this 
requirement is 937,500 hours.

54706 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
S. ICRs Regarding Timeframes and 
Notice Requirements for Standard 
Coverage Determinations (§ 423.568) 
If a Part D plan sponsor makes a 
completely favorable standard decision 
under paragraph (b) of this section, it 
must give the enrollee written notice of 
the determination. The initial notice 
may be provided orally, so long as a 
written follow-up notice is sent within 
3 calendar days of the oral notification. 
The burden associated with the 
requirement proposed in paragraph (d) 
is the time and effort necessary for a 
Part D plan sponsor to notify an enrollee 
(and the prescribing physician or other 
prescriber involved, as appropriate) in 
writing of completely favorable standard 
decision for benefits. We estimate that 
each year, the 456 Part D plan sponsors 
will issue a total of approximately 
760,411 written favorable standard 
notifications for benefits. We further 
estimate that it will take a Part D plan 
sponsor 30 minutes to distribute a single 
notice. The estimated annual burden 
associated with the requirement in 
proposed § 423.568(d) is 380,206 hours. 
The estimated annual cost associated 
with these requirements is $15.2 
million. 
T. ICRs Regarding Timeframes and 
Notice Requirements for Expedited 
Coverage Determinations (§ 423.572) 
If a Part D plan sponsor makes a 
completely favorable expedited decision 
under paragraph (b) of this section, it 
must give the enrollee written notice of 
the determination. The initial notice 
may be provided orally, so long as a 
written follow-up notice is sent within 
3 calendar days of the oral notification. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements listed in § 423.572(b) is 
the time and effort necessary for a Part 
D plan sponsor to notify an enrollee 
(and the prescribing physician or other 
prescriber involved, as appropriate) in 
writing of completely favorable 
expedited decision. We estimate that 
each of the 456 Part D plan sponsors 
will issue an average of 87,103 written 
favorable expedited notifications per 
year. We further estimate that it will 
take a Part D plan sponsor 30 minutes 
to distribute a single notice. The 
estimated annual burden associated 
with the requirement in § 423.572(b) is 
43,552 hours. The estimated annual cost 
associated with these requirements is 
$15.2 million. 
U. ICRs Regarding Access to Covered 
Part D Drugs (§ 423.120) 
Proposed § 423.120(b)(iv) would 
require sponsors to provide enrollees 
with appropriate notice regarding their 
transition process within a reasonable 
amount of time after providing a 
temporary supply of non-formulary Part 
D drugs (including Part D drugs that are 
on a sponsor’s formulary but require 
prior authorization or step therapy 
under a sponsor’s utilization 
management rules). The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and effort necessary for a Part D 
plan sponsor to provide a notice to 
beneficiaries regarding the transition 
process. We estimate this would result 
in 1.35 million notices that would take 
an average of 15 minutes to prepare. We 
then estimate the total burden to be 
337,500 hours. 
Proposed § 423.120(c)(3) would 
require Part D sponsors to contractually 
mandate that their network pharmacies 
submit claims electronically to the Part 
D sponsor or its intermediary on behalf 
of the beneficiary whenever feasible 
unless the enrollee expressly requests 
that a particular claim not be submitted 
to the Part D sponsor or its 
intermediary. Proposed § 423.120(c)(3) 
would require the approximately 28 
pharmacy claims processors currently 
responsible for the electronic 
adjudication of pharmacy benefits to 
change their RxBIN or RxBIN and 
RxPCN combination if such identifiers 
are not already unique to its Medicare 
line of business, and the Part D 
cardholder identification number if it is 
not already unique to each Medicare 
Part D enrollee. We estimate the annual 
hourly burden to be 1,380 hours per 
processor to make the coding changes 
necessary to implement this 
requirement. There are an estimated 28 
processors. At an estimated $150 cost 
per hour for the fully loaded labor of a 
computer programmer, we estimate the 
yearly burden to be 38,640 hours for CY 
2010. This is a one-time only burden for 
programming. 
The estimated annual cost associated 
with requirements associated with the 
transition process is $6.8 million. 
V. ICRs Regarding Timeframes and 
Responsibility for Making 
Redeterminations (§ 423.590) 
Proposed § 423.590(d)(2) states that if 
a Part D plan sponsor first notifies an 
enrollee of an adverse or favorable 
expedited determination orally, it must 
mail written confirmation to the 
enrollee within 3 calendar days of the 
oral notification. The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary for a Part D plan 
sponsor to follow up an initial oral 
notification to an enrollee with a written 
notification. We estimate that each of 
the 456 Part D plan sponsors will have 
to distribute approximately 95 notices 
for an estimated annual number of 
43,320 responses. Similarly, we estimate 
that the work will be conducted at a rate 
of $40 per hour. The estimated annual 
cost associated with this requirement is 
$1.733 million. 
W. Annual Information Collection 
Burden 
Table 9 shows our estimates of the 
annual reporting and recordkeeping 
burden based on the discussion detailed 
in sections III.A. through III.V. of this 
proposed rule.

54708 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
If you comment on these information 
collection and recordkeeping 
requirements, please do either of the 
following: 
1. Submit your comments 
electronically as specified in the 
ADDRESSES section of this proposed rule; 
or 
2. E-mail comments to the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget to 
oira_submission@omb.eop.gov or fax 
comments to 202–395–7285. Please 
reference this rule (CMS–4085–P) and 
mark your comments to the attention of 
CMS desk officer. 
IV. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
Federal Register documents, we are not 
able to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the DATES section of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
V. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impact of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 on Regulatory Planning and 
Review (September 30, 1993), the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96–354), 
section 1102(b) of the Social Security 
Act, section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), Executive Order 13132 on 
Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 
804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866 directs 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity). A regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) must be prepared for 
major rules with economically 
significant effects ($100 million or more 
in any 1 year). 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
entities, if a rule has a significant impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. For purposes of the RFA, small 
entities include small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions. Most 
hospitals and most other providers and 
suppliers are small entities, either by 
nonprofit status or by having revenues 
of $7.0 million to $34.5 million in any 
1 year. Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. MA organizations and Part D 
sponsors, the only entities that will be 
affected by the provisions of this rule, 
are not generally considered small 
business entities. They must follow 
minimum enrollment requirements 
(5,000 in urban areas and 1,500 in non- 
urban areas) and because of the revenue 
from such enrollments, these entities are 
generally are above the revenue 
threshold required for analysis under 
the RFA. While a very small rural plan 
could fall below the threshold, we do 
not believe that there are more than a 
handful of such plans. A fraction of MA 
organizations and sponsors are 
considered small businesses because of 
their non-profit status. For an analysis 
to be necessary, however, 3 to 5 percent 
of their revenue would have to be 
affected by the provisions. We do not 
believe that this threshold would be 
reached by the proposed requirements. 
Therefore, the Secretary has determined 
that this proposed rule will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis, if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of 
a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. We are not 
preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) 
of the Act because we believe and the 
Secretary has determined that this rule 
will not have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 also 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule whose mandates require spending 
in any 1 year by State, local or tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation. 
That threshold level is currently $133 
million. This proposed rule is expected 
to reach this spending threshold. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule and subsequent final rule 
that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
We do not believe that this proposed 
rule imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
Because there are costs to plans and 
sponsors associated with several 
provisions of this rule, we indicate 
general areas affected and specify the 
costs associated with these. For specific 
burden associated with the 
requirements and the bases for our 
estimates, see section III. of this 
proposed rule. 
We estimate this rule is 
‘‘economically significant’’ as measured 
by the $100 million threshold, and 
hence a major rule under the 
Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, 
we have prepared a Regulatory Impact 
Analysis. 
B. Increase in Costs to MA 
Organizations and Part D Sponsors 
The provisions of this proposed rule 
would require MA organizations and 
Part D sponsors an estimated cost of 
approximately $321.68 million for CY 
2010. We believe the following 
requirements will result in monetized 
transfers from the Federal Government 
to MA organizations and Part D 
sponsors between 2011 and 2015. Risk 
Adjustment Validation (Part 422), 
Quality Improvement program 
(§ 422.152), Medicare Secondary Payer 
Procedures (§ 422.108), Validation of 
Reporting Requirements (§ 422.516 and 
§ 423.514), the Quality Improvement 
Program and Consumer Satisfaction 
Surveys (§ 422.152 and § 423.156), 
Providing Written Notifications 
(§ 422.568(e)), Organization 
Determinations, Transition Process 
Notice (§ 423.120), Standard Timeframe 
and Notice Requirements for Coverage 
Determinations (§ 423.568), Drug 
Utilization Management, Quality 
Assurance, and Medication Therapy 
Management Programs (§ 423.153), and 
Pharmacy Use of Standard Technology 
under Part D (§ 423.120(c)(3)). We 
believe that the MIPPA 176 provision 
will result in savings. However, the 
MIPPA 176 provision will not take 
effect until CY 2011. Most of the 
proposed changes do not require 
additional data collection or reporting 
burden but rather involve clarification 
or codification of current policy. The 
economic impact will be funded 
through monetized transfers from the 
Federal government to health plans and 
through increases in beneficiary 
premiums. We expect that these 
expenses will be largely reflected in 
higher bid prices. Given that there are 
approximately 27 million PDP enrollees 
and an additional 8 million MA

enrollees, the impact on the premium 
per enrollee will be minimal. In CY 
2010, the estimated cost is 
approximately $3.2 million, translating 
to under $10.00 per enrollee. The affect 
on the monthly premium would be less 
than $1.00. The estimated impact on 
enrollees would appear to be negligible.

C. Expected Benefits 
Beginning in CY 2014, we expect net 
savings due to the combined impact of 
these new proposed provisions. We 
expect that the net impact across the 6- 
year period from CY 2010 through CY 
2015 will be a cost of $596.58 million. 
Many of the new requirements 
involve clarifications of existing 
regulations and policies. As such, they 
should help plans to improve their 
administrative operational functions 
which will streamline the Medicare 
Prescription Drug program and 
strengthen beneficiary protections 
within the program. Specifically, we 
believe that the proposed requirements 
will improve coordination of care, 
increase quality of data reporting, 
increase ability to comply with existing 
regulations and policies, enhance 
appeal and grievance procedures, and 
curtail illegal marketing practices. 
Additional benefits include clarification 
of timeframes and notification 
requirements. Some of the new 
requirements may lead to changes in 
health plan service areas. 
We anticipate that several of the 
proposed requirements will be 
beneficial to PBMs when assisting Part 
D sponsors with administering the Part 
D benefit. Proposed codification of 
transition process requirements and 
establishment of protected classes will 
assist PBMs in applying the Part D 
requirements consistently across Part D 
plans and managing the Part D sponsor’s 
benefit packages more efficiently. 
Establishing cut-off limits for 
coordination of benefits and requiring 
Part D sponsors to report other payer 
information in a timely fashion to CMS’ 
COB contractors will improve the 
administrative burden of the payment 
reconciliation process. The technical 
correction to the definition of gross 
covered prescription drug costs will also 
help PBMs with calculating a 
beneficiary’s gross covered prescription 
drug costs. 
D. Analysis by Provision 
With regard to part 422, Risk 
Adjustment Data Validation (RADV), we 
estimate that we will audit 
approximately 110 MA organizations for 
risk adjustment data validation (RADV) 
in FYs 2010 and 2011. We estimate that 
at least 50 percent of these 
organizations—55 MA organizations— 
will pursue one of the options presented 
in these proposed rules for disputing or 
appealing their RADV audit findings— 
via attestation, documentation dispute, 
or RADV payment error calculation 
appeal. Our experience to date indicates 
that approximately 25 percent of HCCs 
audited under RADV audit procedures 
result in signature and credential- 
related medical record review errors. 
Each MA organization that undergoes a 
RADV audit is on average asked to 
validate approximately 700 HCCs for 
200 beneficiaries selected for audit. 
Since signature and credential-related 
errors comprise such a large overall 
percentage of RADV error, there is 
clearly an incentive for MA 
organizations to submit attestations 
along with medical records missing 
signatures/credentials to avoid incurring 
a RADV audit error. With approximately 
110 organizations expected to undergo 
RADV audit annually, we can estimate 
that MA organizations will seek to 
produce roughly 19,250 attestations (or 
175 attestations per audit). We estimate 
that it will take 1 hour to prepare and 
submit one attestation to CMS. This 
equates to 19,250 burden hours at 
approximately $59.20/hour (based on 
U.S. Department of Labor statistics for 
hourly wages for management 
analysts)—or, an aggregate annual dollar 
burden on the MA industry of 
$1,139,600. RADV audit statistics to 
date indicate that approximately 55 
percent of RADV audit errors are of the 
type that may be eligible for 
documentation dispute. Clearly there is 
a financial incentive for MA 
organizations to pursue documentation 
dispute in an attempt to avoid incurring 
a RADV audit error. Utilizing the same 
statistics regarding the number of 
organizations that we expect to undergo 
RADV audit annually (that is, 110 
organizations), we estimate that 100 
percent of these organizations will 
pursue documentation dispute. Each 
MA organization that undergoes RADV 
audit is on average asked to validate 
approximately 700 HCCs for 200 
beneficiaries audited. Therefore, we can 
expect each organization that undergoes 
RADV audit to pursue documentation 
dispute for 385 HCCs. This equates to an 
overall volume of 42,350 document 
dispute requests annually. We estimate 
that it will take approximately 1 hour to 
prepare the necessary documentation to 
dispute one HCC via documentation 
dispute. This equates to 42,350 burden 
hours at approximately $59.20/hour 
(based on U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL) statistics for hourly wages for 
management analysts) or an aggregate 
annual dollar burden on the MA 
industry of $2,507,120. 
Finally, regarding requests for RADV 
payment error calculation appeals, 
based upon existing RADV audit data, 
we estimate that 100 percent of MA 
organizations that undergo RADV audit

54710 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
will appeal CMS’ RADV payment error 
calculation since we anticipate the 
RADV audit process to uncover 
significant MA program overpayments. 
Currently, MA organizations do not 
have this appeal right so the estimates 
that we provide in this regard are 
altogether new and unique to the 
proposed appeals process. Beyond the 
costs associated with appealing the 
RADV payment error calculation, there 
is little financial incentive to not appeal 
this error calculation. As specified at 
proposed § 422.311(c)(3), the RADV 
payment error calculation appeal 
process is a three-pronged appeal 
process comprised of reconsideration, 
hearing and Administrator-review steps. 
MA organizations can be expected to 
incur costs in preparing appeals at each 
level of the appeal process. For the first 
step in the appeal process—the 
reconsideration step—we estimate that 
MA organizations will take 
approximately 5 hours to prepare the 
necessary reconsideration 
documentation necessary to appeal 
CMS’ RADV payment error calculation. 
This equates to 550 burden hours at 
approximately $59.20/hour (based on 
DOL statistics for hourly wages for 
management analysts)—or, an aggregate 
annual dollar burden on the MA 
industry of $32,560. For step two—the 
hearings step—since the proposed 
hearing is an on-the-record hearing that 
is limited to the documentation 
submitted to CMS and the CMS 
reconsideration official—we do not 
anticipate MA organizations incurring 
substantial costs in submitting the 
documentation necessary to invoke their 
RADV payment error calculation 
hearing rights. We again estimate that 
MA organizations will take 
approximately 5 hours to prepare the 
necessary hearings documentation 
necessary to appeal CMS’ RADV 
payment error calculation and the 
determination of the CMS 
reconsideration official. This equates to 
550 burden hours at approximately 
$59.20/hour (based on U.S. Dept. of 
Labor statistics for hourly wages for 
management analysts)—or, an aggregate 
annual dollar burden on the MA 
industry of $32,560. 
Lastly, in seeking CMS Administrator 
review, we estimate that MA 
organizations will take approximately 5 
hours to prepare the necessary 
documentation to submit to the CMS 
Administrator for his/her review of 
CMS’ RADV payment error calculation. 
This equates to 550 burden hours at 
approximately $59.20/hour (based on 
DOL statistics for hourly wages for 
management analysts) or an aggregate 
annual dollar burden on the MA 
industry of $32,560. Together, we 
estimate that MA organizations will in 
the aggregate incur costs approximating 
$97,680. 
In totaling the burden for attestations, 
documentation dispute and RADV 
payment error calculation appeal, we 
estimate the aggregate annual burden on 
the MA industry to be: $1,139,600 for 
attestations; $2,507,120 for 
documentation dispute; and $97,680 for 
RADV payment error calculation appeal. 
Together, we estimate the total burden 
to the MA industry to be approximately 
$3.74 million as shown in Table 11. 
We anticipate effects on entities other 
than MA organizations. RADV-eligible 
physicians and other practitioners, 
including hospitals, will be impacted by 
the attestation and documentation- 
dispute-related provisions of this 
proposed rule. We note that while MA 
organizations are not required to submit 
attestations, we anticipate that most will 
at least attempt to do so, given the high 
likelihood of overturning RADV errors. 
However, we do not believe that this 
impact will be significant. Our 
experience to date indicates that 
approximately 25 percent of HCCs 
audited under RADV audit procedures 
result in signature and/or credential- 
related medical record review errors. 
Each MA organization that undergoes 
RADV audit is on average asked to 
validate approximately 700 HCCs for 
200 beneficiaries audited. Clearly, there 
is an incentive for MA organizations to 
submit attestations along with medical 
records missing signatures/credentials 
to avoid incurring a RADV audit error. 
With approximately 110 organizations 
expected to undergo RADV audit 
annually, we can estimate that MA 
organizations will seek to produce 
roughly 19,250 attestations (or 175 
attestations per audit). We estimate that 
it will take physicians and other 
practitioners 15 minutes (or one-quarter 
of an hour) or less to review a medical 
record, make a determination whether 
the medical record originated from the 
physician or practitioner in question, 
sign and date the CMS attestation, and 
return the attestation to the requesting 
MA organization. This equates to 4,813 
burden hours at approximately $59.20/ 
hour (based on U.S. Department of 
Labor statistics for hourly wages for 
management analysts) or an aggregate 
annual dollar burden on other providers 
of $284,930. We estimate no burden to 
other providers for either the 
documentation dispute proposal or the 
RADV payment error calculation appeal 
proposal since providers will not be 
called-upon to participate in these 
activities. 
The proposed attestation and 
documentation dispute processes will 
have an overwhelmingly net-positive 
impact on the Medicare program 
through the ultimate lowering of MA 
program payment errors. Our experience 
to date in conducting RADV audits and 
upon consultation with medical record 
review-industry experts leads us to 
estimate that MA organizations will 
submit attestations for up to 65 percent 
of attestation-eligible RADV errors. We 
likewise estimate that we will overturn 
approximately 15 percent of 
documentation-dispute-eligible RADV 
errors via the documentation dispute 
process. Together, these MA program 
error-rate reductions will have a net 
positive impact on the Medicare 
program. 
Since the proposed appeals process 
has not been piloted as part of the 
RADV audit process to date, there is no 
way to realistically estimate its impact 
on the Medicare program.

We are also proposing to require in 
§ 422.152 that each MAO contract 
conduct CCIPs in patient populations 
and quality improvement projects in 
areas identified by CMS and also collect 
and report new quality measures. The 
mean estimated burden per contract as 
indicated in section III. of this proposed 
rule is 1,000 hours. The estimated mean 
cost per hour for these contracts is 
$59.20 (wages, fringe benefits, and 
overhead). The mean cost per contract 
is: 1,000 × $59.20 = $59,200. Since the 
number of contracts is estimated to be 
624, the overall estimated cost across all 
contracts is: 624 × $59,200 = 
$36,940,800. 
Regarding the Medicare Secondary 
Payer (MSP) Procedures (§ 422.108), in 
2007 original Medicare estimated total 
savings due to MSP at $6.5 billion. This 
included $2.9 billion recovered or 
avoided for working-aged individuals, 
$1.9 billion for working-disabled 
individuals, $877 million for workers’ 
compensation, $278 million for ESRD 
beneficiaries, and another $485 million 
recovered or avoided for liability and 
other insurers. In 2007, there were 
approximately 8.5 million MA enrollees 
and 44 million total Medicare enrollees 
(an MA penetration rate of 
approximately 19 percent). The $6.5 
billion in MSP savings can be attributed 
to 35.5 million original Medicare 
enrollees, which equates to 
approximately $183 per original 
Medicare enrollee that can be attributed 
to MSP savings. In 2009 MA penetration 
is higher, with approximately 11 million 
MA enrollees out of approximately 45 
million total Medicare enrollees—or 
about 24 percent MA penetration. We 
assume a similar MSP rate for MA 
enrollees as obtains in original 
Medicare, and therefore project total 
savings from MSP in the MA program in 
2007 as close to $1.5 billion and by 2010 
at approximately $2 billion. 
The estimated impact of MSP on 624 
MA organizations and 456 PDPs based 
on 3.1158 million burden hours at 
approximately $25/hour (based on U.S. 
Department of Labor (DOL) statistics for 
the hourly wages of claims analysts of 
$22.20/hour and for management 
analysts of $59.20/hour), is 
approximately $77.9 million. We expect 
an MA organization to use 
approximately 1.5 FTEs to implement 
Part C MSP procedures related to 
avoiding costs, reporting data, and 
collecting from liable third parties 
related to MSP. We expect the work mix 
to be completed approximately 90 
percent by the claims analyst and 10 
percent by the management analyst. 
We note that MAOs claim expenses 
related to MSP recoveries as part of their 
administrative overhead. MA 
organizations that faithfully pursue and 
recover from liable third parties will 
have lower medical expenses. Lower 
medical expenses make such plans more 
attractive to enrollees. The lower the 
medical expenses in an MA plan, the 
higher the potential rebate. The rebate is 
calculated as the difference between the 
cost of Medicare benefits and the 
benchmark for that plan. The 
benchmark is a fixed amount. Therefore, 
as the cost of Medicare benefits go down 
(with the benchmark remaining 
constant), the larger the rebate. 
Therefore, as more MSP dollars are 
collected or avoided, medical expense 
go down and rebates go up, allowing the 
sponsoring MA organization to offer 
potential enrollees additional non- 
Medicare benefits funded by rebate 
dollars. Such non-Medicare benefits 
include reductions in cost sharing. 
Since cost sharing is generally 
expressed as a percentage of medical 
costs, such cost sharing will also be 
proportionally lower as overall medical 
costs go down—providing MA 
organizations offering such plans with 
an additional competitive edge. 
Regarding validation of reporting 
requirements (§ 422.516 and § 423.514), 
the main focus will be on how the 
sponsor collects, stores, and reports the 
new Part C and Part D data 
requirements. Standards and procedures 
will also focus on how sponsors 
compile data, and verify calculations, 
computer code, and algorithms. The 
estimated mean hourly burden per 
affected part C and Part D sponsor to 
procure an auditing organization and to 
support the auditing organization in its 
data collection efforts including staff 
interviews is 120 hours as indicated in 
section III. of this proposed rule. We 
believe the auditor that is hired by the 
plan will typically have a team 
consisting of a management analyst, two 
senior auditors, a senior claims analyst, 
a senior statistician, an IT systems 
analyst, a computer programmer, and a 
word processor. We used May 2008 
wage statistics supplied by the 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor 
Statistics to develop estimates of direct 
wages. We also added fringe benefits, 
overhead costs, and general and 
administrative expenses using 
percentages that are consistent with 
CMS contracts. Based on our experience 
and in consultant with program experts, 
we developed an estimate of the hourly 
burden. The estimated mean cost per 
hour for these sponsors is $43.14 
(wages, fringe benefits, and overhead). 
The estimated mean number of hours 
per sponsor is 120. The mean cost per 
sponsor to procure and support the 
auditor is therefore: 120 x $43.14 = 
$5,177. Since the number of sponsors is 
estimated to be 710, the overall 
estimated cost across all sponsors to do 
the work involved in procuring and 
supporting the auditing contractors is: 
710 × $5,177 = $3,675,670. 
The total estimated burden hours 
related to the time and effort for all 
auditing organizations to perform the 
annual audit for both Part C and Part D 
data validation is estimated to be 
215,840. The mean cost per hour 
(includes direct wages, fringe benefits, 
overhead costs, general and 
administrative expenses, and fee) is 
estimated to be $194.21. Therefore, the 
estimated annual cost for auditing 
contracts involving all 710 sponsors is: 
215,840 × $194.21 = $41,918,287. The 
total estimated annual cost for auditing 
contracts and for the procurement and 
audit support time and effort of the 
sponsors is: $41,918,287 + 3,675,670= 
$45,593.956. The auditing costs will be 
allowable costs in the plan’s bid. 
We are also proposing that beginning 
in 2011 MA organizations and Part D 
sponsors will begin paying for the data 
collection costs of the CAHPS annual 
survey. Data collection is to be 
performed by a contractor hired by the 
MAO or part D sponsor. The mean 
estimated burden per contract as 
indicated in section III. of this proposed 
rule is 51 hours. The estimated mean 
cost per contract is $5,023. The overall 
estimated annual cost across 624 
contracts is: 624 × $5,023 = $3,134,352. 
Regarding written notices of a 
favorable standard coverage 
determination (§ 423.568(d)), the burden 
is the time and effort necessary for each 
of an estimated 456 PDP sponsors to 
disclose the necessary information in 
writing to an enrollee. (Note: plan 
sponsors have always been required to 
formulate a decision and notify the 
enrollee of that decision, so the 
additional burden is only related to 
communicating the favorable decision 
in writing). We estimated an annual 
burden of 380,206 hours. At an 
estimated cost of $40.00 per hour 
(salary/wages, fringe benefits, 
overhead), the estimated total annual 
cost of this proposed change is 
$15,208,240. 
The burden associated with providing 
written notice of a favorable expedited 
coverage determination (§ 423.572(b)) is 
the time and effort necessary for each of 
an estimated 456 PDP sponsors to 
disclose the necessary information in 
writing to an enrollee (given that plan 
sponsors have always been required to 
formulate favorable and adverse 
expedited decisions, notify enrollees of

those decisions, and follow-up in 
writing if the decision is adverse, the 
additional burden is only related to 
communicating the favorable decision 
in writing). 
The total estimated annual burden 
associated with this requirement was 
43,550 hours. At an estimated cost of 
$40.00 per hour, the estimated total 
annual cost of this proposed change is 
$1,742,000. Therefore, the total 
estimated annual cost for these two 
provisions is $15,208,240 + $1,742,000 
= $16,950,240. The total estimated 
annual cost for years 2010–2015 is $102 
million. 
Additionally, regarding written 
notices, proposed § 423.590(d)(2) states 
that if a Part D plan sponsor first notifies 
an enrollee of an adverse or favorable 
expedited redetermination decision 
orally, it must mail written confirmation 
to the enrollee within 3 calendar days 
of the oral notification. The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and effort necessary for a Part D 
plan sponsor to notify an enrollee (and 
the prescribing physician or other 
prescriber involved, as appropriate) in 
writing of an adverse or favorable 
expedited redetermination decision. We 
estimate that each year the 456 Part D 
plan sponsors will issue a total of about 
21,232 written adverse and favorable 
expedited notifications. We further 
estimate that it will take a Part D plan 
sponsor 30 minutes to distribute a single 
notice. The estimated annual burden 
associated with the requirement in 
§ 423.590(d)(2) is 10,616 hours. At an 
estimated cost of $40.00 per hour, the 
estimated total annual cost of this 
proposed change is $424,640. The total 
estimated annual cost for years 2010– 
2015 is $2.5 million. 
With regard to standard timeframes 
and notice requirements for 
organization determinations (§ 422.568 
and § 423.568), the total estimated 
annual burden is 380,206 hours. At an 
estimated average hourly cost of $40.00, 
the total annual estimated cost for CY 
2010 is $15,208,240. 
Regarding the MIPPA 176 protected 
drug class provisions, we project that 
future utilization and hence future costs 
will be lower than estimated in the 
Medicare Advantage and Prescription 
Drug Programs: MIPPA–Related 
Marketing Revisions interim final rule 
with comment period published in the 
January 16, 2009 Federal Register (74 FR 
2881). This is because the proposed 
provisions may be somewhat more 
restrictive than those in the January 16, 
2009 IFC. That is, in the January 16, 
2009 IFC, we had not proposed 
definitions of associated with MIPPA 
protected classes criteria. The 
definitions, as outlined in this proposed 
rule, provide further precision with 
respect to the MIPPA criteria leading to 
a reduced likelihood of certain disease 
categories qualifying as protected 
classes. 
The FY 2010 President’s Budget 
estimated cost of this provision was 
about $4.9 billion for FYs 2010 through 
2019. This is the amount that was built 
into our FY 2010 budget projections. 
The revised cost estimate is roughly 
$1.6 billion over the same period. As a 
result, the modifications made in the 
rule will save Part D an estimated $3.3 
billion for FYs 2010 through 2019 
relative to our current Budget baseline. 
Regarding the Transition Process 
(§ 423.120), proposed § 423.120 would 
require sponsors to provide enrollees 
with appropriate notice regarding their 
transition process within a reasonable 
amount of time after providing a 
temporary supply of non-formulary Part 
D drugs (including Part D drugs that are 
on a sponsor’s formulary but require 
prior authorization or step therapy 
under a sponsor’s utilization 
management rules). We estimated the 
annual hourly burden to be 337,500 
hours in section III. of this proposed 
rule. At an estimated average $20 cost 
per hour for the fully loaded labor of an 
administrative assistant, we estimate the 
yearly cost to be $6,750,000 in CY 2010. 
Regarding drug utilization 
management, quality assurance, and 
medication therapy management 
programs (MTMPs), proposed § 423.153 
states that Part D plans must offer a 
minimum level of medication therapy 
management services for each 
beneficiary enrolled in the MTMP that 
includes but is not limited to annual 
comprehensive medication reviews with 
written summaries. We estimated that 
the total annual burden associated with 
this requirement is 937,500 hours. At an 
average cost of $120 per hour, we 
estimate the yearly cost to be 
$112,500,000. 
Regarding the Use of Standardized 
Technology under Part D (§ 423.120) 
requirements, we estimated an annual 
burden of 38,640 hours, with a cost of 
$150 per hour. The estimated one time 
cost impact for CY 2010 is $5.80 
million. 
E. Anticipated Effects 
1. Effects of Cap on Out-of-Pocket Costs 
and Cost Sharing Amounts 
We are proposing to establish and 
require local MA plans to have an 
annual catastrophic cap on members 
out-of-pocket cost sharing and that we 
will also establish limits on the cost 
sharing amounts that MA plans can 
impose for Part A and B services. These 
proposed changes are significant in that 
they will help beneficiaries to 
understand and anticipate their possible 
health care expenditures. However, we 
do not believe these changes will by 
themselves have a significant impact on 
either plan participation or plan costs. 
We will set the parameters for the cost 
sharing and spending cap and this 
should make it easier for MA plans to 
compete on a level playing field and as 
previously noted enhance transparency 
for prospective enrollees. We note that 
while there will be cost sharing limits 
and a catastrophic cap. We are not 
setting a cap on the monthly plan 
premium beyond the overall actuarial 
limit (determined annually by CMS) on 
the amount of cost sharing that MA 
plans may impose on its enrollees. In 
other words, MA plans will still have 
the option of collecting the maximum 
allowed actuarial amount of cost sharing 
from beneficiaries in terms of premium, 
and costs sharing amounts for plan 
covered benefits. 
2. Alternatives Considered 
a. Strengthening CMS’ Ability To Take 
Timely, Effective Contract 
Determinations or Intermediate 
Sanctions (Part C & D) 
We are proposing to modify the 
regulations to more clearly and 
accurately clarify our existing statutory 
authority to terminate a contract. The 
existing enumerated list of 
determinations that could support a 
decision to terminate a contract is not 
all inclusive. Therefore, we are 
proposing to remove the enumerated 
list. Also, we are proposing to revise the 
regulatory language to clarify that 
failure to comply with any of the 
regulatory requirements contained in 
parts 422 and 423 or failure to meet our 
performance requirements, may 
constitute a basis for CMS to determine 
that the MA Organization or Part D 
sponsor meets the requirements for 
contract termination in accordance with 
the statutory standard. We considered 
modifying or adding to the existing list 
of determinations that could support 
termination (which included 12 items in 
parts 422 and 11 items in parts 423). 
However, we believe that continuing to 
add to the existing list may fail to make 
sufficiently clear to sponsoring 
organizations that all violations of our 
regulations and/or contract and 
performance requirements may be used 
to support a termination decision.

54713 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 203 / Thursday, October 22, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
b. Changing the Standards of Review, 
Clarifying the Standard of Proof and 
Burden of Proof for Appeals, and 
Modifying the Conduct of Hearing for 
Contract Decisions (Including Denials of 
Initial Applications to Contract, Service 
Area Expansions for Existing Contracts, 
Contract Non-Renewals and 
Terminations, and Intermediate 
Sanctions) 
We are proposing to change the 
standards of review and clarify the 
standard of proof when an appeal of a 
contract determination or intermediate 
sanction is requested and an evidentiary 
hearing is conducted. The current 
standards of review require the hearing 
officer to determine whether the 
sponsoring organization can 
demonstrate ‘‘substantial compliance’’ 
with Part C and/or Part D requirements 
on the ‘‘earliest of’’ the following three 
dates: The date the organization 
received written notice of contract 
determination or intermediate sanction, 
the date of the most recent onsite audit, 
or the date of the alleged breach of 
current contract or past substantial 
noncompliance. In practice, these 
standards of review (‘‘substantial 
compliance’’ and ‘‘earliest of test’’) have 
led to confusion among parties to the 
hearing and have been difficult for the 
hearing officer to apply. Additionally, 
though the existing regulations 
explicitly state that the sponsoring 
organization bears the burden of proof, 
it does not provide the standard of proof 
that is to be applied by the hearing 
officer. Therefore, we are proposing to 
delete the ‘‘substantial compliance’’ and 
‘‘earliest of’’ test and revise the 
regulations to explicitly state the 
standard of proof and provide clear 
standards of review for each type of 
contract determination or intermediate 
sanction. 
First, we are proposing to explicitly 
state that the hearing officer must apply 
the ‘‘preponderance of the evidence’’ 
standard of proof when weighing the 
evidence at all hearings for contract 
determinations or intermediate 
sanctions. Second, we are proposing to 
clarify the standards of review, which 
vary according to the type of contract 
determination or intermediate sanction. 
In particular, the proposed change 
makes the distinction between how the 
evidentiary standard of review is to be 
applied to appeals of CMS 
determinations involving Part C or D 
contract qualification applications, 
those involving the termination or non- 
renewal of a Part C or D sponsor 
contract, and those involving the 
imposition of intermediate sanctions. 
Finally, we are proposing to clarify that 
because the sponsoring organization 
bears the burden of proof, under any 
briefing schedule determined by the 
hearing officer, it must first present 
evidence and argument to the hearing 
officer before we present our evidence 
and argument. We considered leaving 
the existing regulations unchanged. 
c. Clarify That CMS May Require a 
‘‘Test Period’’ During an Enrollment/ 
Marketing Sanction 
We are proposing to provide that in 
instances where an enrollment and/or 
marketing suspension has been 
imposed, we may determine that it is 
appropriate to subject the MA 
organization or Part D sponsor to a ‘‘test 
period’’ whereby the organization or 
sponsor will, for a limited time, engage 
in marketing activities and/or accept 
enrollments in order to assist us in 
making a determination as to whether 
the bases for the sanctions have been 
corrected and are not likely to recur. 
Currently, our experience has shown 
that we are limited in our ability to 
adequately determine if marketing and 
enrollment deficiencies have been 
corrected while marketing and 
enrollment sanctions are in place. If the 
test of the Part D sponsor or MA 
organization’s marketing/enrollment 
processes reveals that deficiencies have 
not been corrected and/or are likely to 
recur, the sanction will continue to 
remain in place. 
We considered leaving the existing 
regulations unchanged. However, we 
believe this proposal will strengthen our 
ability to adequately assess compliance 
with our requirements. The proposal 
will also help us to avoid situations 
where, because we do not have the 
ability to perform adequate testing of an 
organization’s systems/processes (such 
as information systems testing) to 
ensure the deficiencies have been 
corrected, we lift a sanction and then 
find that we have to re-engage in the 
statutory and regulatory process for 
reinstituting the sanction. 
d. Right for CMS To Require an 
Independent Audit of Sponsoring 
Organizations Under Intermediate 
Sanction 
We are proposing that we have the 
flexibility to require certain Part D 
sponsors and MA organizations, under 
intermediate sanctions, to hire an 
independent auditor to evaluate 
whether the bases for a sanction have 
been corrected and are not likely to 
recur before we come to a determination 
as to whether lifting of the sanction 
would be appropriate. The independent 
auditor would be hired by the 
sponsoring organization and work in 
accordance with CMS specifications in 
order to provide accurate and reliable 
information to CMS. This would benefit 
the sponsoring organization by 
improving the process for removing a 
sanction, which may reduce the 
duration of the sanction. A similar 
approach is used by the Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) in their 
Corporate Integrity Agreements and/or 
Self-Disclosure Protocol processes. 
We considered leaving the regulations 
unchanged. This existing regulatory 
scheme requires us to rely solely on its 
internal resources to assess whether the 
underlying deficiencies that form the 
basis of an intermediate sanction have 
been corrected and are not likely to 
recur. Given our experience with the 
nature and extent of some compliance 
deficiencies (for example, those caused 
by information technology issues or lack 
of adequate internal controls) and the 
need to obtain the level of skill and 
experience necessary to conduct an 
exhaustive audit and verification of the 
correction of these deficiencies, we 
believe this additional flexibility and 
access to expertise (such as a qualified 
independent auditor) is appropriate and 
will benefit both plan sponsors and 
CMS. 
Another option considered is not 
requiring certain sponsoring 
organizations to hire an independent 
auditor. Instead, we would consider 
using results obtained by an 
independent auditor hired under a 
sponsoring organization’s own initiative 
to evaluate its compliance with our 
requirements. We may consider the 
sponsoring organization’s initiative to 
obtain an independent audit similar to 
a ‘‘safe harbor’’ and may be afforded 
some weight in CMS’ determination of 
whether the bases for the sanction have 
been corrected and are not likely to 
recur. We invite comments from 
sponsors and the industry about this 
alternative proposal and suggestions on 
other options we could implement to 
accomplish the desired outcome. 
e. The Ability for CMS To Require 
Sponsors To Disclose to Current and 
Potential Enrollees Compliance and 
Performance Deficiencies 
We are proposing to require certain 
sponsors to disclose their current 
compliance and/or performance 
deficiencies to existing and potential 
enrollees. This disclosure option could 
be exercised by CMS either when a 
sponsor is sanctioned or when a 
sponsor’s compliance deficiencies rise 
to a certain level such that we make the 
determination that existing or potential 
enrollees should be notified of these 
deficiencies. This level of transparency

will provide additional incentives for 
sponsors to make improvements to their 
operations and also provide relevant 
information to beneficiaries and the 
public concerning plan choices. 
We considered not adding this 
disclosure authority to the existing 
regulations. However, we believe this 
change is necessary to provide us with 
another tool to strengthen our 
compliance and oversight authority and 
provide appropriate transparency 
concerning compliance and/or 
performance deficiencies to 
beneficiaries and the public. 
f. Section 176 of the MIPPA—Formulary 
and Protected Classes Requirements 
(Part D) 
The critical policy decision was how 
broadly or narrowly we interpret 
specific terms in the MIPPA provisions. 
Interpreted broadly, the provisions in 
section 176 of the MIPPA might easily 
encompass many classes of drugs and 
significantly increase costs to the Part D 
program by eliminating the need for 
manufacturers to aggressively rebate 
their products for formulary placement. 
Only a narrow interpretation of these 
criteria would limit the number of 
classes ‘‘protected’’ under MIPPA. 
g. Reducing Duplicative and Low 
Enrollment Plans (Parts C & D) 
We are proposing to implement 
regulations to reduce duplicative benefit 
packages based upon our authority to 
add such additional terms to its 
contracts with Medicare Advantage 
organizations or Part D plan sponsors as 
we ‘‘may find necessary and 
appropriate’’ as specified in section 
1857(e)(1) of the Act (see also section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act 
(incorporating section 1857(e)(1) of the 
Act by reference for Part D.) In addition, 
we are using our authority under section 
1860D–11(d)(2)(B) of the Act as further 
support for our authority to propose 
regulations imposing ‘‘reasonable 
minimum standards’’ on Part D 
sponsors. 
One alternative would be to make no 
changes to our current regulations 
regarding bid submission and review 
and to continue our current efforts to 
eliminate duplicative or low enrollment 
plan options. However, since our 
current regulations do not explicitly 
address the issue of eliminating 
duplicative or low enrollment plans, we 
believe that codifying our authority to 
do so will provide us with more 
leverage over plans during the bid 
submissions, review, negotiation, and 
approval processes. 
Another alternative would be to 
provide more detail in regulation text 
regarding the specific criteria we would 
use to eliminate duplicative or low 
enrollment plan options. We believe 
addressing the issue generally in 
regulations text, but containing most of 
the discussion regarding specific criteria 
to the preamble, maintains our 
flexibility to adjust our review processes 
and criteria consistent with current 
market trends. 
h. Validation of Part C and Part D 
Reporting Requirements 
Several of the proposed changes do 
involve costs to MAOs and Part D 
sponsors. One such regulatory change 
was the audit requirement of Part C and 
Part D measures. We considered not 
requiring an audit. However, because 
we believe that an audit is required to 
ensure that the Part C and Part D 
measures are consistent with our 
specifications, are reliable, valid, and 
comparable, and are credible to 
stakeholders, this alternative was 
rejected. A second such regulatory 
change was requiring MAOs and Part C 
sponsors to assume a portion of the cost 
of the annual CAHPs survey that would 
result from hiring contractors to conduct 
the data collection. We considered not 
requiring MAOs and Part C sponsors to 
hire contractors to perform the CAHPs 
data collection. However, we rejected 
this alternative, because we believe that 
the benefits obtained through this 
regulatory change outweigh the costs 
incurred by the MAOs and Part C 
sponsors. 
F. Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf ), in the Table 13, we have 
prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
provisions of this proposed rule. Table 
13 provides our best estimate of the 
costs and savings as a result of the 
changes.

G. Conclusion 
We expect that the cost of 
implementing these provisions will be 
$321.68 million in CY 2010. Sponsors 
will experience additional costs which 
they are likely to pass on to us through 
direct subsidy payments and to 
beneficiaries through increases in 
premiums as reflected in their bids. 
Beginning in CY 2013, we expect that 
these provisions will generate a net 
savings on an annual basis. For the 
entire estimated time period, CY 2010 
through 2015, we expect the overall 
impact to be a cost of $596.58 million. 
In accordance with the provisions of 
Executive Order 12866, this proposed 
rule was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget.

PART 422—MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 
PROGRAM 
11. The authority citation for part 422 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: Secs. 1102 and 1871 of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302 and 
1395hh). 
Subpart A—General Provisions 
12. Section 422.2 is amended by— 
A. Adding the definitions of 
‘‘Attestation process,’’ ‘‘documentation 
dispute process,’’ and ‘‘Hierarchical 
condition categories.’’ 
B. Revising the definition of ‘‘Point of 
service.’’ 
C. Adding the definitions of ‘‘RADV 
payment error calculation appeal 
process’’ and ‘‘Risk adjustment data 
validation (RADV) audit.’’ 
D. Revising the introductory text of 
the definition of ‘‘Service area’’. 
E. Adding the definition of ‘‘The one 
best medical record’’. 
The additions and revision read as 
follows: 
§ 422.2 Definitions. 
Attestation process means a CMS- 
developed RADV audit-related dispute 
process that enables MA organizations 
undergoing RADV audit to submit CMS- 
generated and physician practitioner 
signed attestations for medical records 
with missing or illegible signatures or 
credentials. Physicians/practitioners 
who documented health care services in 
the specific medical record under RADV 
review will be allowed to attest that 
they provided and documented the 
health care services evidenced in the 
specific medical record. 
* * * * * 
Documentation dispute process 
means a dispute process that enables 
MA organizations that have undergone 
a RADV audit to dispute medical record 
discrepancies that pertain to incorrect 
ICD–9–CM coding by allowing affected 
MA organizations to submit formal 
written disputes regarding discrepancy 
findings for the initial medical record 
that an organization submitted for HCC 
validation. 
* * * * * 
Hierarchical condition categories 
(HCC) means disease groupings 
consisting of disease codes (currently 
ICD–9–CM codes) that predict average 
healthcare spending. HCCs represent the 
disease components of the enrollee risk 
score that are applied to MA payments. 
* * * * * 
Point of service (POS) means a benefit 
option that an MA HMO plan can offer 
to its Medicare enrollees as an 
additional, mandatory supplemental, or 
optional supplemental benefit. Under 
the POS benefit option, the HMO plan 
allows members the option of receiving 
specified services outside of the HMO 
plan’s provider network. In return for 
this flexibility, members typically have 
higher cost-sharing requirements for 
services received and, when offered as 
a mandatory or optional supplemental 
benefit, may also be charged a premium 
for the POS benefit option. 
* * * * * 
RADV payment error calculation 
appeal process means an administrative 
process that enables MA organizations 
that have undergone RADV audit to 
appeal the CMS calculation of an MA 
organization’s RADV payment error. 
* * * * * 
Risk adjustment data validation 
(RADV) audit means a CMS- 
administered payment audit of a 
Medicare Advantage (MA) organization 
that ensures the integrity and accuracy 
of risk adjustment payment data. 
* * * * * 
Service area means a geographic area 
that for local MA plans is a county or 
multiple counties, and for MA regional 
plans is a region approved by CMS 
within which an MA-eligible individual 
may enroll in a particular MA plan 
offered by an MA organization. 
Facilities in which individuals are 
incarcerated are not included in the 
service area of an MA plan. Each MA 
plan must be available to all MA-eligible 
individuals within the plan’s service 
area. In deciding whether to approve an 
MA plan’s proposed service area, CMS 
considers the following criteria: * * * 
* * * * * 
The one best medical record for the 
purposes of Medicare Advantage Risk 
Adjustment Validation (RADV) is 
defined as: the clinical documentation 
for a single encounter for care (that is, 
a physician office visit, an inpatient 
hospital stay, or an outpatient hospital 
visit) that occurred for one patient 
during the data collection period. The 
single encounter for care must be based 
on a face-to-face encounter with a 
provider deemed acceptable for risk 
adjustment and documentation of this 
encounter must be reflected in the 
medical record. 
13. Amend § 422.4 by— 
A. Revising paragraphs (a)(1)(v) and 
(a)(2)(i)(A). 
B. Redesignating paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) 
as paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C). 
C. Adding new paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) 
and (a)(3)(iv). 
The revisions and additions read as 
follows:

(D) Does not permit prior notification 
for out-of-network services—that is, a 
reduction in the plan’s standard cost- 
sharing levels when the out-of-network 
provider from whom an enrollee is 
receiving plan-covered services 
voluntarily notifies the plan prior to 
furnishing those services, or the enrollee 
voluntarily notifies the PPO plan prior 
to receiving plan-covered services from 
an out-of-network provider.

individual is out of the service area but 
within the United States (as defined in 
§ 400.200 of this chapter) for a period of 
consecutive days longer than 6 months 
but less than 12 months, the MA 
organization may elect to offer to the 
individual the option of remaining 
enrolled in the MA plan if— 
(A) The individual is disenrolled on 
the first day of the 13th month after the 
individual left the service area (or 
residence, if paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of 
this section applies);

with paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of the 
section; 
(C) The MA organization makes this 
visitor/traveler option available to all 
Medicare enrollees who are absent for 
an extended period from the MA plan’s 
service area. MA organizations may 
limit this visitor/traveler option to

(a) * * * 
(10) Prevailing patterns of community 
health care delivery. Coordinated care 
and PFFS MA plans that meet Medicare 
access and availability requirements 
through direct contracting network 
providers must do so consistent with 
the prevailing community pattern of 
health care delivery in the areas where 
the network is being offered. Factors 
making up community patterns of 
health care delivery that CMS will use 
as a benchmark in evaluating a 
proposed MA plan health care delivery 
network include, but are not limited 
to— 
(i) The number and geographical 
distribution of eligible health care 
providers available to potentially 
contract with an MAO to furnish plan 
covered services within the proposed

An MA organization may choose to 
dispute CMS’ operational processing of 
RADV medical records using a CMS- 
administered documentation dispute 
process. 
(i) RADV-related errors eligible for 
documentation dispute process. The 
documentation dispute process will 
apply only to the operational processing 
of those medical records selected for 
RADV audit. In order to be eligible for 
documentation dispute, medical records 
have to have been submitted to CMS by 
the CMS-established deadline. 
(ii) RADV-related audit errors 
ineligible for documentation dispute 
process. 
(A) Medical record coding 
discrepancies. 
(B) MA organizations may not use the 
documentation dispute process to

under any current or prior contract with 
CMS under title XVIII of the Act or fails 
to complete a corrective action plan 
during the 14 months preceding the 
deadline established by CMS for the 
submission of contract qualification 
applications, CMS may deny an 
application based on the applicant’s 
failure to comply with the requirements 
of the Part C program under any current 
or prior contract with CMS even if the 
applicant currently meets all of the 
requirements of this part.

(2) * * * 
(iii) If CMS does not receive a revised 
application within 10 days from the 
date of the notice, or if after timely 
submission of a revised application, 
CMS still finds the applicant does not 
appear qualified to contract as an MA 
organization or has not provided enough 
information to allow CMS to evaluate 
the application, CMS will deny the 
application. 
(3) * * * 
(iii) The applicant’s right to request a 
hearing in accordance with the

effective enforcement of the standards 
when noncompliance or unethical 
behavior is determined. 
(F) Establishment and implementation

monitoring and identification of 
compliance risks. The system should 
include internal monitoring and audits 
and, as appropriate, external audits, to 
evaluate the MA organization, including 
first tier entities’, compliance with CMS

(ii) In instances where marketing or

CMS determines the deficiencies have 
not been corrected or are likely to recur,

Authority: Secs. 1102, 1860D–1 through 
1860D–42, and 1871 of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395w–101 through 
1395w–152, and 1395hh). 
Subpart B—Eligibility and Enrollment 
58. Section 423.34 is revised to read 
as follows: 
§ 423.34 Enrollment of low-income 
subsidy eligible individuals. 
(a) General rule. CMS must ensure the 
enrollment into Part D plans of low- 
income subsidy eligible individuals 
who fail to enroll in a Part D plan. 
(b) Definitions. 
Full-benefit dual-eligible individual. 
For purposes of this section, a full- 
benefit dual eligible individual means 
an individual who is— 
(1) Determined eligible by the State 
for— 
(i) Medical assistance for full-benefits 
under Title XIX of the Act for the month 
under any eligibility category covered 
under the State plan or comprehensive 
benefits under a demonstration under 
section 1115 of the Act; or 
(ii) Medical assistance under section 
1902(a)(10)(C) of the Act (medically 
needy) or section 1902(f) of the Act 
(States that use more restrictive 
eligibility criteria than are used by the 
SSI program) for any month if the 
individual was eligible for medical 
assistance in any part of the month. 
(2) Eligible for Part D in accordance 
with § 423.30(a) of this subpart. 
Low-income subsidy-eligible 
individual. For purposes of this section, 
a low-income subsidy eligible 
individual means an individual who 
meets the definition of full subsidy 
eligible (including full benefit dual 
eligible individuals) or other subsidy 
eligible in § 423.772 of this part. 
(c) Reassigning low-income subsidy- 
eligible individuals. Notwithstanding 
§ 423.32(e) of this subpart, during the 
annual coordinated election period, 
CMS may reassign certain low-income 
subsidy-eligible individuals in another 
PDP if CMS determines that the further 
enrollment is warranted. 
(d) Enrollment rules. 
(1) General rule. Except for low- 
income subsidy eligible individuals 
who are qualifying covered retirees with 
a group health plan sponsor as specified 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, CMS 
enrolls those individuals who fail to 
enroll in a Part D plan into a PDP 
offering basic prescription drug 
coverage in the area where the 
beneficiary resides that has a monthly 
beneficiary premium amount that does 
not exceed the low-income subsidy 
amount (as defined in § 423.780(b) of 
this part). In the event that there is more 
than one PDP in an area with a monthly 
beneficiary premium at or below the 
low-income premium subsidy amount, 
individuals are enrolled in such PDPs 
on a random basis. 
(2) Individuals enrolled in an MSA 
plan or one of the following that does 
not offer a Part D benefit. Low-income 
subsidy eligible individuals enrolled in 
an MA private fee-for-service plan or 
cost-based HMO or CMP that does not 
offer qualified prescription drug 
coverage or an MSA plan and who fail 
to enroll in a Part D plan must be 
enrolled into a PDP plan as described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
(3) Exception for individuals who are 
qualifying covered retirees. 
(i) Full benefit dual eligible 
individuals who are qualifying covered 
retirees as defined in § 423.882 of this 
part, and for whom CMS has approved 
the group health plan sponsor to receive 
the retirement drug subsidy described in 
subpart R of this part, also are 
automatically enrolled in a Part D plan, 
consistent with this paragraph, unless 
they elect to decline that enrollment. 
(ii) Before effectuating such an 
enrollment, CMS provides notice to 
such individuals of their choices and 
advises them to discuss the potential 
impact of Medicare Part D coverage on 
their group health plan coverage. The 
notice informs individuals that they will 
be deemed to have declined to enroll in 
Part D unless they affirmatively enroll 
in a Part D plan or contact CMS and 
confirm that they wish to be auto- 
enrolled in a PDP. Individuals who elect 
not to be auto-enrolled, may enroll in 
Medicare Part D at a later time if they 
choose to do so. 
(iii) All other low-income subsidy 
eligible beneficiaries who are qualified 
covered retirees are not enrolled by 
CMS into PDPs. 
(e) Declining enrollment and 
disenrollment. Nothing in this section 
prevents a low-income subsidy eligible 
individual from— 
(1) Affirmatively declining enrollment 
in Part D; or 
(2) Disenrolling from the Part D plan 
in which the individual is enrolled and 
electing to enroll in another Part D plan 
during the special enrollment period 
provided under § 423.38. 
(f) Effective date of enrollment for 
full-benefit dual eligible individuals. 
Enrollment of full-benefit dual eligible 
individuals under this section must be 
effective as follows: 
(1) January 1, 2006 for individuals 
who are full-benefit dual-eligible 
individuals as of December 31, 2005. 
(2) The first day of the month the 
individual is eligible for Part D under 
§ 423.30(a)(1) for individuals who are 
Medicaid eligible and subsequently 
become newly eligible for Part D under 
§ 423.30(a)(1) on or after January 1, 
2006. 
(3) For individuals who are eligible 
for Part D under § 423.30(a)(1) of this 
subpart and subsequently become newly 
eligible for Medicaid on or after January 
1, 2006, enrollment is effective with the 
first day of the month when the 
individuals become eligible for both 
Medicaid and Part D. 
(g) Effective date of enrollment for 
non-full-benefit dual-eligible 
individuals who are low-income 
subsidy-eligible individuals. The

part) must have a contracted pharmacy 
network consisting of retail pharmacies 
sufficient to ensure that, for 
beneficiaries residing in each State in a 
PDP sponsor’s service area (as defined 
in § 423.112(a) of this part), each State 
in a regional MA-organization’s service 
area (as defined in § 422.2 of this part),

I/T/U pharmacies and pharmacies 
operated by Federally Qualified Health 
Centers and Rural Health Centers 
toward the standards for convenient 
access to network pharmacies in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
(3) Access to non-retail pharmacies. A 
Part D sponsor’s contracted pharmacy 
network may be supplemented by non- 
retail pharmacies, including pharmacies 
offering home delivery via mail-order 
and institutional pharmacies, provided 
the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section are met. 
(4) Access to home infusion 
pharmacies. A Part D sponsor’s 
contracted pharmacy network must 
provide adequate access to home 
infusion pharmacies consistent with 
written policy guidelines and other 
CMS instructions. A Part D plan must 
ensure that such network pharmacies, at 
a minimum meet all the following 
requirements: 
(i) Are capable of delivering home- 
infused drugs in a form that can be 
administered in a clinically appropriate 
fashion. 
(ii) Are capable of providing infusible 
Part D drugs for both short-term acute 
care and long-term chronic care 
therapies. 
(iii) Ensure that the professional 
services and ancillary supplies 
necessary for home infusion therapy are 
in place before dispensing Part D home 
infusion drugs. 
(iv) Provide delivery of home infusion 
drugs within 24 hours of discharge from 
an acute care setting, or later if so 
prescribed. 
(5) Access to long-term care 
pharmacies. A Part D sponsor must offer 
standard contracting terms and 
conditions, including performance and 
service criteria for long-term care 
pharmacies that CMS specifies, to all 
long-term care pharmacies in its service 
area. The sponsor must provide 
convenient access to long-term care 
pharmacies consistent with written 
policy guidelines and other CMS 
instructions. 
(6) Access to I/T/U pharmacies. A 
Part D sponsor must offer standard 
contracting terms and conditions 
conforming to the model addendum that 
CMS develops, to all I/T/U pharmacies 
in its service area. The sponsor must 
provide convenient access to I/T/U 
pharmacies consistent with written 
policy guidelines and other CMS 
instructions. 
(7) Waiver of pharmacy access 
requirements. CMS waives the 
requirements under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section in the case of either of the 
following: 
(i) An MA organization or cost 
contract (as described in section 1876(h) 
of the Act) that provides its enrollees 
with access to covered Part D drugs 
through pharmacies owned and 
operated by the MA organization or cost 
contract, provided the organization’s or 
plan’s pharmacy network meets the 
access standard set forth— 
(A) At § 422.112 of this chapter for an 
MA organization; or 
(B) At § 417.416(e) of this chapter for 
a cost contract. 
(ii) An MA organization offering a 
private fee-for-service plan described in 
§ 422.4 of this chapter that— 
(A) Offers qualified prescription drug 
coverage; and 
(B) Provides plan enrollees with 
access to covered Part D drugs 
dispensed at all pharmacies, without 
regard to whether they are contracted 
network pharmacies and without 
charging cost-sharing in excess of that 
described in § 423.104(d)(2) and (d)(5). 
(8) Pharmacy network contracting 
requirements. In establishing its 
contracted pharmacy network, a Part D 
sponsor offering qualified prescription 
drug coverage— 
(i) Must contract with any pharmacy 
that meets the Part D sponsor’s standard 
terms and conditions; and 
(ii) May not require a pharmacy to 
accept insurance risk as a condition of 
participation in the Part D sponsor’s 
contracted pharmacy network. 
(9) Differential cost-sharing for 
preferred pharmacies. A Part D sponsor 
offering a Part D plan that provides 
coverage other than defined standard 
coverage may reduce copayments or 
coinsurance for covered Part D drugs 
obtained through a preferred pharmacy 
relative to the copayments or 
coinsurance applicable for such drugs 
when obtained through a non-preferred 
pharmacy. Such differentials are taken 
into account in determining whether the 
requirements under § 423.104(d)(2) and 
(d)(5) and § 423.104(e) are met. Any 
cost-sharing reduction under this 
section must not increase CMS 
payments to the Part D plan under 
§ 423.329. 
(10) Level playing field between mail- 
order and network pharmacies. A Part D 
sponsor must permit its Part D plan 
enrollees to receive benefits, which may 
include a 90-day supply of covered Part 
D drugs, at any of its network 
pharmacies that are retail pharmacies. A 
Part D sponsor may require an enrollee 
obtaining a covered Part D drug at a 
network pharmacy that is a retail 
pharmacy to pay any higher cost-sharing 
applicable to that covered Part D drug 
at the network pharmacy that is a retail 
pharmacy instead of the cost-sharing 
applicable to that covered Part D drug 
at the network pharmacy that is a mail- 
order pharmacy. 
(b) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(ix) Reviews and approves all clinical 
prior authorization criteria, step therapy 
protocols, and quantity limit restrictions 
applied to each covered Part D drug. 
* * * * * 
(2) * * * 
(v) Beginning with contract year 2011, 
except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(vi) of this section, a Part D 
sponsor’s formulary will include all Part 
D drugs in a category or class for which 
both of the following apply: 
(A) Restricted access to the drugs in 
the category or class would have major 
or life threatening clinical consequences 
for individuals who have a disease or 
disorder treated by drugs in such 
category or class; and 
(B) There is a significant need for 
such individuals to have access to 
multiple drugs within a category or 
class due to unique chemical actions 
and pharmacological effects of the drugs 
within a category or class. 
(vi) Exceptions to paragraph (b)(2)(v) 
of this section are as follows: 
(A) Drug products that are rated as 
therapeutically equivalent (under the 
Food and Drug Administration’s most 
recent publication of ‘‘Approved Drug 
Products with Therapeutic Equivalence 
Evaluations,’’ also known as the Orange 
Book). 
(B) Utilization management processes 
that limit the quantity of drugs due to 
safety. 
(C) Other drugs that CMS specifies 
through a process that is based upon 
scientific evidence and medical 
standards of practice (and, in the case of 
antiretroviral medications, is consistent 
with the Department of Health and 
Human Services Guidelines for the Use 
of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV–1– 
Infected Adults and Adolescents) and 
which permits public notice and 
comment. 
(3) Transition process. A Part D 
sponsor must provide for an appropriate 
transition process for enrollees 
prescribed Part D drugs that are not on 
its Part D plan’s formulary (including 
Part D drugs that are on a sponsor’s 
formulary but require prior 
authorization or step therapy under a 
plan’s utilization management rules). 
The transition process must: 
(i) Be applicable to all of the 
following: 
(A) New enrollees into Part D plans 
following the annual coordinated 
election period. 
(B) Newly eligible Medicare enrollees 
from other coverage.

bids and supplemental information 
described in this section for each Part D 
plan it intends to offer in the subsequent 
calendar year.

bids. Potential Part D sponsors’ bid 
submissions must reflect differences in 
benefit packages and plan costs that 
CMS determines to represent substantial 
differences relative to a sponsor’s other 
bid submissions. In order to be

under § 423.265 (b)(2) of this subpart 
from the benefit package represented by 
another bid submitted by the same Part 
D sponsor.

sponsors with new acquisitions. After a 
2-year transition period, as determined 
by CMS, CMS approves a bid offered by

acquired or merged with) another Part D 
sponsor if it finds that the benefit 
package and plan costs represented by

represented by another bid submitted by 
the same Part D sponsor (or parent 
organization to that Part D sponsor).

providers of prescription drug coverage 
when a retroactive claims adjustment 
creates an overpayment or 
underpayment. When a Part D sponsor 
makes a retroactive claims adjustment, 
the sponsor has the responsibility to 
account for SPAPs and other entities 
providing prescription drug coverage in 
reconciling the claims adjustments that 
create overpayments or underpayments. 
In carrying out these reimbursements 
and recoveries, Part D sponsors must 
also account for payments made, and for 
amounts being held for payment, by 
other individuals or entities. Part D 
sponsors must have systems to track and 
report adjustment transactions and to 
support all of the following: 
(1) Adjustments involving payments 
by other plans and programs providing 
prescription drug coverage have been 
made. 
(2) Reimbursements for excess cost- 
sharing and premiums for low-income 
subsidy eligible individuals have been 
processed in accordance with the 
requirements in § 423.800(c). 
(3) Recoveries of erroneous payments 
for enrollees as specified in 
§ 423.464(f)(4) have been sought. 
75. A new § 423.466 is added to 
subpart J to read as follows: 
§ 423.466 Timeframes for coordination of 
benefits. 
(a) Retroactive claims adjustments, 
underpayment refunds, and 
overpayment recoveries. Whenever a 
sponsor receives information that 
necessitates a retroactive claims 
adjustment, the sponsor must process 
the adjustment and issue refunds or 
recovery notices within 45 days of the 
sponsor’s receipt of complete 
information regarding claims 
adjustment. 
(b) Coordination of benefits. Part D 
sponsors must coordinate benefits with 
SPAPs, other entities providing 
prescription drug coverage, 
beneficiaries, and others paying on the 
beneficiaries’ behalf for a period not to 
exceed 3 years from the date on which 
the prescription for a covered Part D 
drug was filled.

(b) Completion of a notice of intent to 
apply. 
(1) An organization submitting an 
application under this section for a

application solely on the basis of 
information contained in the 
application itself and any additional 
information that CMS obtains through 
on-site visits. 
(2) After evaluating all relevant 
information, CMS determines whether 
the application meets all the 
requirements described in this part. 
(b) Use of information from a current 
or prior contract. If a Part D plan 
sponsor fails during the 14 months 
preceding the deadline established by 
CMS for the submission of contract 
qualification applications (or in the case 
of a fallback entity, the previous 3-year 
contract) to comply with the 
requirements of the Part D program 
under any current or prior contract with 
CMS under title XVIII of the Act or fails 
to complete a corrective action plan 
during the 14 months preceding the 
deadline established by CMS for the 
submission of contract qualification 
applications, CMS may deny an 
application based on the applicant’s 
failure to comply with the requirements 
of the Part D program under any current 
or prior contract with CMS even if the 
applicant currently meets all of the 
requirements of this part. 
(c) * * * 
(2) * * * 
(iii) If CMS does not receive a revised 
application within 10 days from the 
date of the notice, or if after timely 
submission of a revised application, 
CMS still finds the applicant does not 
appear qualified to contract as a Part D

enough information to allow CMS to 
evaluate the application, CMS denies 
the application.

compliance program, must be an 
employee of the Part D plan sponsor.

effective training and education for its 
employees including, the chief 
executive and senior administrators or

in their resolution; 
(2) Identify non-compliance or 
unethical behavior; and 
(3) Provide for timely, consistent, and
