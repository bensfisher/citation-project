I.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Section 9411 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-
Frank Act” or the “Act”)2 imposes credit risk retention (“risk retention”) requirements, under 
which securitizers, and, in certain circumstances, originators3 of asset-backed securities (“ABS”) 
must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk for any asset unless the asset is a Qualified 
Residential Mortgage or the originator of the asset meets underwriting standards that the 
Agencies4 will jointly prescribe.   
Under Section 946 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council (the “Council”) is required to conduct a study on the macroeconomic effects of the risk 
retention requirements under Subtitle D of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, with emphasis placed 
on potential beneficial effects with respect to stabilizing the real estate market, and issue a report 
to Congress no later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.5    
This study makes the following conclusions:  
 Securitization is an important source of credit formation to the economy, but certain 
risks of securitization contributed to the financial crisis and macroeconomic 
instability; 
 Risk retention, if properly structured, can address some of these inherent risks by 
requiring an originator or securitizer to have ongoing exposure to the credit risk of the 
underlying assets; and 
 There are macroeconomic implications of securitization and risk retention; to the 
extent that risk retention can incent better lending decisions, it may help to mitigate 
some of the pro-cyclical effects securitization may have on the economy.   
This study also offers several principles and recommendations that should inform the design of a 
risk retention framework so as to strengthen the securitization process and facilitate economic 
                                                 
1  Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a new section 15G to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which 
is codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78o-11.   
2   Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).   
3  Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act defines (i) a securitizer as “(A) an issuer of an asset-backed security; or (B) a person who organizes and 
initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the 
issuer,” 15 U.S.C. § 78o-11(a)(3), and (ii) an originator as a person who “(A) through the extension of credit or otherwise, creates a financial 
asset that collateralizes an asset-backed security; and (B) sells that asset directly or indirectly to a securitizer,” 15 U.S.C. § 78o-11(a)(4).  
4  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (the “Board”), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), must jointly prescribe rules on risk retention 
under Section 941 no later than 270 days following the date of enactment.  Exchange Act, Section 15G(b).  The statute also requires the 
Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), along with the foregoing 
Agencies to jointly prescribe rules on risk retention with respect residential mortgages and defining the Qualified Residential Mortgage.  This 
study refers to the FDIC, the OCC, the Board, the SEC, the FHFA, and HUD collectively as the “Agencies.”

growth by allowing market participants to price credit risk more accurately and allocate capital 
more efficiently.

Over the past forty years, asset-backed securitization has become an increasingly important 
source of credit formation for the economy.  Securitization offers many benefits, including 
increased liquidity, expanded credit availability, and reduced cost of credit.  Without proper 
safeguards, however, securitization can introduce significant risks to financial markets and to the 
economy.  The securitization process involves multiple parties with varying incentives and 
information, thereby breaking down the traditional direct relationship between borrower and 
lender.  The party setting underwriting standards and making lending decisions (the originator) 
and the party making structuring decisions (the securitizer) are often exposed to minimal or no 
credit risk.  By contrast, the party that is most exposed to credit risk (the investor) often has less 
influence over underwriting standards and may have less information about the borrower.  As a 
result, originators and securitizers that do not retain risk can, at least in the short run, maximize 
their own returns by lowering loan underwriting standards in ways that investors may have 
difficulty detecting.  The originate-to-distribute model, as it was conducted, exacerbated this 
weakness by compensating originators and securitizers based on volume, rather than on quality. 
The academic literature provides evidence that mortgage-backed securitization contributed to a 
decline in underwriting standards during the mid-2000s, facilitating an over-supply of 
excessively risky mortgages.  There is also evidence that the expansion of mortgage supply 
through securitization helped accelerate price increases in the housing market to unsustainable 
levels and, therefore, contributed to the ensuing decline in housing prices and the economy. 
To address the problems in the financial system that contributed to the financial crisis, Congress 
enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act’s reforms to the securitization 
market include greater transparency for investors, measures to mitigate conflicts of interest at 
credit ratings agencies, and the credit risk retention requirements in Section 941.  
This study discusses the potential design of a risk retention framework.  Such a framework 
should seek to meet the following objectives: (i) align incentives without changing the basic 
structure and objectives of securitization transactions; (ii) provide for greater certainty and 
confidence among market participants; (iii) promote efficiency of capital allocation; (iv) preserve 
flexibility as markets and circumstances evolve; and (v) allow a broad range of participants to 
continue to engage in lending activities, while doing so in a safe and sound manner.  A risk 
retention framework can be structured in a number of ways to meet these objectives.  The form 
of risk retention, allocation of risk retention to various participants in the securitization chain, 
amount of risk retention, allowances for risk management, and exemptions from risk retention 
are all important variables in the design of any such framework. 
Although a risk retention framework can help align incentives and improve underwriting 
standards, the macroeconomic implications of risk retention are complex.  A risk retention 
 - 4 - 
framework can incent better lending decisions and consequently help strengthen the quality of 
assets underlying a securitization.  It may also help mitigate some of the pro-cyclical effects that 
asset-backed securitization can have on the economy.  However, if overly restrictive, risk 
retention could constrain the formation of credit, which could adversely impact economic 
growth.  The challenge is to design a risk retention framework that maximizes benefits while 
minimizing its costs.   
As the recent financial crisis demonstrates, securitization, without appropriate reforms, can cause 
significant harm to the economy.  Risk retention can help align the interests of the participants in 
the securitization chain, reduce the risks inherent in securitization, and promote the stable 
formation of credit and efficient allocation of capital in the United States.

II. THE STATUTORY MANDATE 
In addition to the general mandate to study the macroeconomic effects of risk retention, Section 
946 calls for the study to include an analysis of the macroeconomic effects of risk retention on 
real estate asset price bubbles.  The statute also calls for consideration of the feasibility of 
minimizing bubbles by proactively adjusting risk retention requirements and minimum 
underwriting standards; whether such adjustments should be formulaic or discretionary; and, 
how such adjustments should be coordinated with monetary policy.  Specifically, Section 946 
requires: 
(1) an analysis of the effects of risk retention on real estate asset price bubbles, 
including a retrospective estimate of what fraction of real estate losses may have 
been averted had such requirements been in force in recent years; 
 
(2) an analysis of the feasibility of minimizing real estate price bubbles by 
proactively adjusting the percentage of risk retention that must be borne by 
creditors and securitizers of real estate debt, as a function of regional or national 
market conditions; 
 
(3) a comparable analysis for proactively adjusting mortgage origination 
requirements; 
 
(4) an assessment of whether such proactive adjustments should be made by an 
independent regulator, or in a formulaic and transparent manner; 
 
(5) an assessment of whether such adjustments should take place independently or 
in concert with monetary policy; and 
 
(6) recommendations for implementation and enabling legislation. 
 
Several points should be noted about the scope of this study. 
First, the study discusses the pro-cyclicality of credit with respect to asset-backed securitizations 
and the potential for risk retention requirements to minimize this pro-cyclicality.  The study does 
not provide a specific quantitative assessment of the fraction of real estate losses that might have 
been averted, because the risk retention rules under Section 941 have not yet been issued, and 
thus cannot be retrospectively considered.  Moreover, sufficient data are not available to make 
such an estimate possible.  Instead, the study provides a broad assessment of the macroeconomic 
impact of risk retention on real estate bubbles and economic cyclicality.

Second, the academic literature on risk retention with respect to asset-backed securitization is 
limited.  Moreover, available information is insufficiently robust to allow for a quantitative 
comparable analysis for proactively adjusting mortgage origination requirements, an assessment 
of formulaic adjustments to such requirements, or a quantitative evaluation as to whether any 
adjustments should be made independently or in concert with monetary policy.  However, the 
study reviews benefits and drawbacks to adjusting risk retention regulation over time.  
Third, the study’s evaluation of the macroeconomic implications of risk retention is confined to 
the existing literature and available data.  Future studies could include more original research and 
make more specific quantitative assessments with respect to the aforementioned questions.  
The analysis presented in this study should serve to inform the rule writing process currently 
underway by the Agencies.  It may also help to create a risk retention framework that will allow 
markets to allocate capital efficiently to American businesses, consumers and homeowners in a 
sustainable fashion, facilitate economic growth and promote financial stability.

III. SECURITIZATION AND ITS MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECURITIZATION MARKET 
Securitization is the process through which a security is created that gives investors a right to the 
cash flows generated by (and frequently, a security interest in) a pool of loans or other financial 
assets.  Typically, securitizations are created with the intent to sell part or all of the securities to 
third-party investors.   
Since the first securitization of residential mortgages in 1970,6 the asset-backed securitization 
market has become an important mechanism for credit formation.  Prior to the advent of 
securitization, funding through the capital markets for many borrowers was more limited.  By 
providing access to the capital markets, securitization has improved the availability and 
affordability of credit to a diverse group of businesses, consumers, and homeowners in the 
United States.  
Much of the initial securitization issuance was backed by residential mortgages, which had 
guarantees from the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) or the 
Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSEs”).7  Early securitizations typically employed a “pass-
through” structure, whereby principal and interest collected on the assets are “passed through” on 
a pro rata basis to the security holders.8   
Over time, asset-backed securitization market participants expanded into other asset classes and 
began to create more complex structures.  The sophistication of securitization structures has 
allowed products to be tailored to meet a variety of demands, such as investor risk and duration 
appetites as well as differences in asset classes.  Tranches of securitizations (e.g., through senior-
subordinated structures) can be used to create investments with different cash flow or loss 
absorption characteristics.   
Starting in the mid-1980s, these concepts were applied to the securitization of non-residential 
mortgage assets, including commercial mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and leases, student 
loans, business loans, equipment loans and leases, and dealer floorplans.9  
In addition, securitizers also developed resecuritizations, in which a securitizer uses the cash 
flows of previously securitized assets as the base for a new securitization.  Resecuritizations 
                                                 
6  The Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA” or “Ginnie Mae”) issued the first mortgage-backed security in 1970. 
7  For purposes of this study, the term Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSEs”) refers to Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” 
or “Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”). 
8  The original securitization market consisted of “agency” securities of pooled residential mortgages, with the payments of interest and principal 
guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

allowed securitizers to finance higher risk assets that might be otherwise difficult to sell, or to 
benefit from the higher rating attributed to a portion of the structure.10 
As a result of this increase in demand and financial innovations, total securitization issuance 
increased over time in all asset classes, particularly in those backed by residential assets (see 
Figure 1).  This chart shows that although commercial asset-backed securitization issuance (such 
as autos and credit cards) increased from the mid-1990’s through the run-up to the financial 
crisis, it did not increase to the same extent as residential mortgage asset-backed issuance, 
particularly for lower credit quality instruments such as subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage 
securitizations.

The asset-backed securitization market became an important source for credit intermediation in 
part because it offers investors a number of benefits that improved efficiency and contributed to 
a lower cost of credit.  Investors in asset-backed securities can efficiently diversify the credit 
risks to which they are exposed because the securitized loan pools are diverse with respect to a 
number of characteristics, including by borrower, property, and geography.  Asset-backed 
securities thus provide an additional source of credit for businesses, consumers, and homeowners 
beyond the traditional banking sector.  Further, asset-backed securitization can legally isolate the

asset from another CDO, further increased the complexity and elongated the chain between originator and investor.

underlying financial assets from the originator and securitizer.  Legal isolation provides investors 
with enhanced protections in the event of a bankruptcy of one or more of these parties and also 
reduces the need to perform due diligence on the credit risk of the originator or securitizer.12  In 
addition, the structuring of securitized interests (e.g., through senior-subordinated structures) can 
create investments with particular credit and interest rate risk profiles that can match investors’ 
risk appetites.   
Securitization also allows financial institutions to manage their credit, funding, and liquidity risk 
more actively, and to increase lending activity because securitization allows them to sell the 
assets and their risks to third parties.  Therefore, their exposure to interest rate and liquidity risks 
is reduced because securitization allows financial institutions to limit such risks by more 
appropriately matching the duration of their assets and liabilities (often referred to as “term 
funding”).  Moreover, asset-backed securitization allows non-bank lenders to originate at 
competitive prices without deposit funding, thereby reducing barriers to entry and increasing 
lending competition. 
Alongside the benefits, the securitization process has certain fundamental weaknesses.  By 
separating the borrower and lender, securitization can create informational and incentive 
asymmetries.  If incentives are not well-aligned, then information asymmetries may lead one 
party to maximize its return at the expense of other parties, particularly borrowers and investors.  
For instance, academic literature has identified at least seven important types of frictions in the 
residential mortgage securitization chain, which can cause agency and adverse selection 
problems in a securitization transaction.13   
One important informational friction highlighted during the recent financial crisis has aspects of 
a “lemons” problem that exists between the issuer and investor.14 An originator has more 
information about the ability of a borrower to repay than an investor, because the originator is 
the party making the loan.  Because the investor is several steps removed from the borrower, the 
investor may receive less robust loan performance information.  Additionally, the large number 
of assets and the disclosures provided to investors may not include sufficient information on the 
quality of the underlying financial assets for investors to undertake full due diligence on each 
asset that backs the security.  
                                                 
12  Typically, the U.S. securitization market relies on separate legal entities – or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) – which is legally separated 
from the sponsoring entity.  This provides securitization investors protection in circumstances where the sponsoring or originating entity enters 
insolvency proceedings.

SECURITIZATION’S ROLE IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS 
Although securitization provides many benefits to lenders and borrowers, it also played a 
significant role in the recent financial crisis.  The financial crisis brought to the surface certain 
inherent problems in the securitization process, including misaligned incentives of participants 
and informational asymmetries.  These problems may have exacerbated the pro-cyclicality of 
lending, resulting in unsustainable increases in asset prices. 
The issuance of asset-backed securities expanded significantly in the lead-up to the financial 
crisis, particularly for residential and commercial mortgages.  This growth accommodated 
investor demand for highly rated asset-backed securities, which over time became increasingly 
complex.  Additional demand for the junior tranches of the highly rated residential mortgage-
backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) began to 
grow as such tranches were increasingly distributed as components of other structured products 
such as collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”).15    
To satisfy the growing investor demand for loans, particularly mortgages, to serve as collateral 
for structured products, originators and securitizers increasingly relied upon an originate-to-
distribute model in which originators sold their loans to securitizers, who then sold securities 
backed by these loans to investors.  This model helped facilitate a rapid increase in origination 
and securitization of subprime and Alt-A loans beginning in the early 2000s, as a large and 
increasing portion of such loans were being securitized and sold to investors, rather than held as 
whole loans on the balance sheets of originators.  For example, between 2001 and 2006, the ratio 
of securitized issuance to origination increased from 46 percent to 81 percent and the market 
share of subprime and Alt-A originations increased from 11 percent to 40 percent (See Figure 2 
below).

In the originate-to-distribute model, originators receive significant compensation upfront without 
retaining a material ongoing economic interest in the performance of the loan.  This reduces the 
economic incentive of originators and securitizers to evaluate the credit quality of the underlying 
loans carefully.  Some research indicates that securitization was associated with lower quality 
loans in the financial crisis.  For instance, one study found that subprime borrowers with credit 
scores just above a threshold commonly used by securitizers to determine which loans to 
purchase defaulted at significantly higher rates than those with credit scores below the 
threshold.17  By lowering underwriting standards, securitization may have increased the amount 
of credit extended, resulting in riskier and unsustainable loans that otherwise may not have been 
originated. 
As the originate-to-distribute model became more pervasive, underwriting criteria weakened 
more broadly.  This deterioration was particularly prevalent with respect to the verification of the 
borrower’s income, assets, and employment for residential real estate loans, and in the 
measurement of net operating income for commercial real estate loans.  Originators began to use 
non-traditional loan products (e.g., negative amortization loans, interest-only periods, and teaser 
rates) that were designed to reduce the initial monthly loan payment.  Additionally, predatory 
lending became a problem as financial products became too complex or inappropriate for certain 
borrowers.   
In theory, aggressive underwriting should have been held in check by market discipline.  
However, recent experience suggests that there was an over-dependence on credit ratings by 
investors as well as other weaknesses in risk management practices.  There were incentive 
problems with respect to credit rating agencies (“CRAs”) in the issuer-pay model.18  Further, the

turmoil has raised questions about the effectiveness of CRAs’ assessment of risks in the rating of 
complex financial products.19  Among the factors that may have contributed to poor ratings 
performance of structured finance products are an underestimation of the severity of a housing 
market downturn and model risk aggravated by limited historical data.20 
In conjunction with the many other drivers that led to the bubble in home prices, the increased 
use of securitization may have contributed to home price appreciation by increasing the supply of 
mortgage credit.  The expansion of subprime mortgage credit was closely correlated with an 
increase in securitization of subprime mortgages, and there is some evidence that the increased 
supply in subprime mortgage credit was in part responsible for greater home price appreciation.21  
Further, subprime mortgage products were often structured under the assumption that home 
prices would continue to rise.  Accordingly, increases in home prices may have reinforced 
expectations for future appreciation, which may have fueled more lending.  Increases in loan 
volume, in turn, may have precipitated further increases in home prices.22  
To the extent that securitization contributed to a bubble in home prices, it also contributed to a 
larger drop in home prices once the bubble burst.  The decline in home values tightened the 
supply of credit because the value of collateral declined, thus raising the cost of credit for 
borrowers who use housing as collateral.23   
In addition to residential lending, securitization may have also contributed to the contraction in 
credit seen in other asset classes, including non-real estate asset classes.  As the market became 
aware of the risks associated with the subprime market, there were doubts about the value of 
securities backed by subprime mortgages.  Research has indicated that many large financial 
institutions were using subprime asset-backed securities to collateralize short-term borrowings.  
As the value of the collateral was called into question, it became harder for the banks to maintain 
access to their short-term liquidity.24  This in turn may have caused the market to doubt the 
solvency of these institutions, which resulted in a further contraction in liquidity.

19  While there is limited direct evidence on this point in the academic literature, recent work by Ashcraft, Vickery, and Goldsmith (2010) 
documents evidence that credit rating agencies reduced risk-adjusted subordination levels for non-agency RMBS deals during the recent MBS 
boom.

These disruptions to individual financial institutions had a material impact on financial markets 
and macroeconomic conditions.  Once a financial institution fails, there can be significant 
spillovers beyond the firm because the failure can spark contagion, in part due to declines in 
market liquidity.25  For example, some evidence suggests that financial institutions that relied 
more heavily on short-term funding (such as borrowings collateralized by subprime asset-backed 
securities) reduced lending to the corporate sector to a greater extent during the crisis.26  
During the financial crisis, the prices of asset-backed securities, such as those backed by auto 
loans, credit cards, student loans, loans to businesses, and loans secured by heavy equipment all 
fell dramatically and simultaneously.27  For example, credit spreads on credit card, student loan, 
CMBS, and auto asset-backed securities widened during the financial crisis (see Figure 3).  
Further, the private new origination market slowed significantly or – for certain asset classes – 
stopped altogether.  Credit spreads for some asset classes traded at levels over 300 times higher 
than their historical average, making new issuance uneconomical and constraining funding for 
credit in these markets to businesses, consumers and homeowners.

Asset-backed securities may have been particularly susceptible to sharp price declines, because 
the complexity of the securitization structure made these assets difficult for market participants 
to evaluate quickly.  Additionally, perceptions regarding misaligned incentives in the 
securitization market caused market participants to become increasingly pessimistic about the

quality of the underlying collateral.  At the outset, market participants did not have clarity about 
where the risks were greatest and which counterparties were most significantly exposed.  The 
crisis was exacerbated by the fact that many of the investors in these instruments had not 
anticipated potential losses and had failed to manage their risk exposure appropriately.   
The financial crisis was not the first time that markets for securitized products experienced 
significant disruptions.  For example, significant losses in the franchise loan securitization 
market from 1996 to 1998 and the manufactured housing loan securitization market from 1994 to 
1996 demonstrate that complex financial products and unchecked lending practices can lead to 
unsustainable credit formation.   
As the crisis intensified, losses occurred throughout the securitization chain.  Where originators 
held loans that had not yet been securitized and securitizers held loans or securities that had not 
yet been sold, these entities took losses.  However, the primary losses were experienced by 
investors who held the asset-backed securities.  The investor base in such securities was diverse, 
including pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, domestic and foreign banks, and 
hedge funds. 
Taken as a whole, these problems illustrate that markets are unable, in certain circumstances, to 
align the incentives of parties in the securitization chain adequately.  Moreover markets may not 
fully internalize the risks securitization can pose to financial and economic stability.  Such 
weaknesses demonstrate the need for regulatory reforms.

IV. RISK RETENTION AND THE DODD-FRANK ACT  
REGULATORY REFORMS TO SECURITIZATION 
To prevent future crises and support greater stability in financial markets, Congress passed 
comprehensive financial reform legislation in July 2010.  
The Dodd-Frank Act provides market participants and regulators with tools to address the 
underlying problems of securitization witnessed in the recent financial crisis.  Many of these 
reforms rely on investors to enforce market discipline, but also recognize that regulatory 
oversight is necessary.  These reforms include: 
 Risk retention requirements;   
 Credit rating agency reform and conflicts of interest; 
 Improved transparency and issuer due diligence; 
 Consumer protection; and 
 Improved monitoring of systemic risks throughout the financial system. 
For further details, see Appendix A. 
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, there are other reform efforts underway.  These reforms 
include accounting changes under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 860, 
Transfers and Servicing (commonly called FAS 166) and ASC Topic 810, Consolidations 
(commonly called FAS 167), and modifications to regulatory capital requirements under the 
Basel Accord.  The accounting changes influence whether a securitizer must consolidate a 
securitization onto its balance sheet, which can affect the decision whether to securitize a pool of 
loans.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has put forward a new 
framework, which seeks to improve the capital and liquidity position of banks.  Included in these 
provisions are a number of measures that seek to ensure that sufficient capital is held against 
securitization exposures (see Appendix B).  
The challenges in the asset-backed securitization market are not unique to the United States, and 
other countries are also implementing regulatory changes to address these challenges.  For 
example, the European Parliament has recently adopted a set of reforms known as Article 122a 
 - 16 - 
of the Capital Requirements Directive.29  These rules require credit risk retention of 5 percent, 
which is similar to the baseline set forth in Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
RISK RETENTION AND ITS MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS 
Credit risk retention (herein referred to as “risk retention”) refers to the meaningful exposure to 
the credit risk of a securitization’s underlying assets that cannot be removed, sold, or hedged for 
a specified period of time.  This definition of risk retention does not include representations and 
warranties (i.e., the risk that the loans were not underwritten pursuant to stated policies and 
procedures).  It also does not include interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, or other types 
of market and macroeconomic risk that a securitizer might retain.  
Risk retention requirements may reduce risks to financial stability arising from incentive and 
informational asymmetries between the investor and earlier securitization chain participants.  
They may also improve loan quality because participants might better internalize the costs of 
poor underwriting, as they must now hold a portion of the underlying risk.  By aligning the 
incentive structure to reflect the incentives of traditional portfolio lending more closely, risk 
retention may help ensure that securitizers and originators are making prudent loans that are 
priced appropriately, as securitizers of these assets will want to be compensated for the risks they 
now must hold.  
In principle, traditional bank lending alleviates problems typically associated with asymmetric 
information, because lenders have the proper incentives to screen and monitor borrowers.30  
However, these incentives depend on lenders retaining the risk associated with the loans they 
make.31  By removing the credit risk, securitization may reduce an originator’s incentives to 
properly underwrite and evaluate borrowers.   
Consistent with those arguments, academic literature suggests that securities that have some 
form of risk retention may provide better incentives than securities without risk retention.  A 
solution to a “lemons” problem is risk-sensitive compensation, often achieved by requiring the 
originator to have a stake in the outcome.  During the run-up to the financial crisis, many 
investors did not take adequate account of these informational asymmetries, and therefore a 
“lemons” problem existed.  It was only after asset performance began deteriorating that this 
problem became apparent. 
                                                 
29  Article 122a of the Capital Requirements Directive consists of two directives: (i) Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (recast), known as the Banking 
Consolidation Directive (“BCD”); and (ii) Directive 2006/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital 
adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (recast), known as the Capital Adequacy Directive. Article 122a is part of the BCD.

The academic literature on loan syndications has documented that retained share is used to 
reduce the importance of information asymmetries between lead managers and other syndicate 
members.32  In particular, it indicates that retained share may have a larger impact on loan price 
for risky and opaque firms, where these frictions are likely to be important, and the ability to 
hedge retained share has an adverse impact on the supply of credit to these types of firms.33  
There is evidence that when the originator and the securitizer of Alt-A mortgage-backed 
securities were affiliated, the resulting securities were less likely to experience losses.  This 
resulted, in part, because the originator was less likely to sell poorly underwritten assets to its 
own affiliate for securitization.34  
To the extent that risk retention helps avoid deterioration in underwriting standards, it may help 
prevent a recurrence of the sort of credit expansion that led to the home price bubble in the recent 
financial crisis.

33  In particular, there is evidence that the onset of credit default swap (“CDS”) trading, which permits the lead manager to hedge its exposure 
without knowledge of other members, has had an adverse impact on the supply of credit to opaque and risky corporate borrowers. See A.

V. ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR RISK RETENTION 
PRINCIPLES 
As the Agencies promulgate regulations for risk retention as required by Section 941, they 
should seek to develop a framework that will balance the benefits of risk retention against its 
potential costs — incentivizing originators and securitizers to be conscious of the risk in the 
underlying assets that they are originating or distributing, while not unduly raising the cost of 
credit.  Any framework should serve to mitigate the misalignment of incentives, asymmetric 
information, and macroeconomic risks associated with securitization, and simultaneously 
promote a robust securitization market that can continue to provide credit to businesses, 
consumers and homeowners in the United States.  Because such regulations will apply to a 
variety of assets and securitization structures, there are multiple approaches that the Agencies 
can consider in executing the statutory requirements.  Such a framework should seek to achieve 
the following: 
 Align incentives.  Asset-backed securitization developed because it provides specific risk 
transfer benefits and loweres the cost of credit, in addition to being a source of term 
funding.  By reducing risk and better aligning incentives, risk retention can improve loan 
quality and underwriting standards, but preserve the benefits of risk and capital transfer. 
 
 Provide greater certainty and confidence among market participants.  A risk retention 
framework that provides clear rules can help market participants accurately price risk.  
 
 Promote efficiency of capital allocation.  Risk retention can promote more efficient 
allocation of capital across the economy because it can help prevent excess credit flows at 
excessively low interest rates that do not accurately reflect the risks of assets. 
 
 Preserve flexibility as markets and circumstances evolve.  The framework can take into 
account the changing nature of markets and future innovations. 
 
 Allow a broad range of participants to continue to engage in lending activities, while 
doing so in a safe and sound manner.  Implementation that takes into account unique 
aspects of smaller originators and securitizers can preserve a robust and competitive 
securitization market. 
 
While risk retention offers many potential benefits, it is one of many reforms.  It cannot address 
all problems in the securitization chain, and will work in conjunction with other reforms.  
Moreover, risk retention may be more suitable in some circumstances than others, depending on 
the specific nature of the underlying financial assets. 
 - 19 - 
CONSTRUCTING A ROBUST RISK RETENTION FRAMEWORK 
There are a number of factors to consider when evaluating how to implement a risk retention 
framework.  The spectrum of options includes the following:  
 Form of risk retention.  There are several different forms of risk retention that one could 
consider in developing a framework.  While there are many variations, the general forms 
include: a vertical slice (a pro rata piece of every tranche), a horizontal slice (a first loss 
interest in the securitization structure), or an equivalent exposure of the securitized pool 
(retaining a random selection of assets from the pool).  
 
 Allocation of risk retention.  The point along the securitization chain where risk retention 
is held also affects the outcome of the risk retention requirements.  Section 941 places the 
primary responsibility for retaining risk on the securitizer, but the originator, and in some 
cases other participants, could be permitted to hold this exposure.  Whether the exposure 
is held or shared among different entities can also drive different incentives.  
 
 Amount of risk retention.  A framework could employ a static amount of risk retention, 
whereby the amount of exposure does not vary across asset classes, asset quality or 
economic cycle.  Alternatively, the framework could allow for variations.  Thus, the 
amount of risk retention could be a function of time and / or a function of asset 
characteristics. 
 
 Hedging, prevention of arbitrage, and allowance for risk management.  Specific 
hedging of the risk retention required by Section 941 is prohibited by the Dodd-Frank 
Act, and any framework should seek to minimize arbitrage opportunities.  However, it is 
also important for financial institutions to manage their other risks for safety and 
soundness purposes.  Therefore, the framework should seek to prohibit the transfer or 
hedging of the specific credit risk required to be retained, but allow firms to manage other 
risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange, and macroeconomic risks. 
  
 Exemptions from risk retention.  A risk retention framework could include the ability to 
exempt higher quality assets meeting rigorous underwriting standards.  In addition to the 
required exemptions for the QRM and other asset classes, the framework could exempt 
securitizers from holding the credit risk of higher quality assets that meet additional 
product, underwriting, and other standards that tend to decrease credit risk.  
 
The choices that the Agencies make in establishing and implementing a framework must balance 
macroeconomic risks with the availability and cost of credit, as discussed later in this study.   
 - 20 - 
FORM  
In constructing a framework for risk retention requirements, a securitizer could be required to 
employ a particular form of risk retention or allowed to choose from a list of permitted 
choices.  The primary choices could include: (i) vertical risk-retention: retention of a pro rata 
economic interest in the credit risk of the securitization; (ii) horizontal risk-retention: 
retention of a first loss interest in the securitization; and (iii) representative sample: retention 
of a subset of assets that are selected randomly from the original pool intended to be 
securitized that has credit risk characteristics similar to those of the securitized assets.   
VERTICAL (PRO RATA) RISK RETENTION 
Vertical risk retention requires the retention of a pro rata economic interest in the credit 
risk of the securitization, equivalent to retaining a pro rata portion of each tranche.  For 
example, a five percent risk retention for a three-tranche securitization comprised of a 94 
percent (or $94) senior tranche, a 5 percent (or $5) subordinate tranche and a 1 percent 
(or $1) equity tranche would be equal to a total of $5, comprised of retention of $4.70 of 
the senior tranche (5 percent of $94), $0.25 of the subordinate tranche (5 percent of $5), 
and $0.05 of the equity tranche (5 percent of $1).  As shown in this example, vertical risk 
retention allocates the risk of loss through the entire securitization.  
                            
Senior Tranche -
94%
Subordinate – 5%
Retained  Senior 
Tranche 4.70%
Retained  Sub 
Tranche 0.25%
Equity – 1% Retained  Equity Tranche 0.05%     
HORIZONTAL (FIRST LOSS) RISK RETENTION 
Horizontal risk retention involves the retention of the first loss credit risk.  This typically 
involves the allocation of all losses on the securitized assets until the par value of the first 
 - 21 - 
loss position is reduced to zero.  Horizontal risk retention is graphically depicted below in 
simplified form: 
 
                                                
Senior Tranche -
95%
Subordinate – 5%  
In the above example, a securitizer with a 5 percent horizontal risk retention requirement 
would hold this horizontal piece as a subordinated tranche or tranches.  By placing the 
securitizer in the first loss position, any losses in excess of those projected (and implicitly 
priced) at origination will first affect the subordinate tranche holder, until the losses 
exceed the subordination provided by the horizontal risk retention.    
EQUIVALENT EXPOSURE 
A potential third form of risk retention involves the securitizer retaining on its balance 
sheet a representative sample of all the assets that are transferred to the issuing entity.  To 
do so, the securitizer would need to select a random sample of assets that comprises a 
percentage of the unpaid principal balance of entire pool from the pre-defined pool of 
assets designated for potential securitization.  
To ensure that the loans retained have a similar credit risk to those securitized, a number 
of protections would likely have to be put in place.  
ALLOCATION  
The point in the securitization chain where risk retention is held can affect incentive 
alignment differently.  In traditional lending, the originator of credit typically holds a loan on 
its balance sheet, thereby retaining all, or a significant share, of the risks associated with the 
loan.  The risk retention requirements discussed above could be imposed on various 
 - 22 - 
participants in the securitization chain to adjust incentives.35  Understanding the role and 
incentives of each major participant in the securitization chain can drive different choices in 
implementation of risk retention.   
SECURITIZER 
Section 941 defines a securitizer as “(A) an issuer of an asset-backed security; or (B) a 
person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by selling or 
transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the 
issuer.”  The securitizer oversees the creation and sale of the securities backed by loans 
purchased from originators. This process has several components, which may sometimes 
be divided among separate firms, although this study generally treats them as if carried 
out by a single entity. 
The securitizer performs the legal and economic functions required for a securitization, 
including reviewing loan documents and origination standards, handling any required 
registration of offer and the sale of asset-backed securities with the SEC if a public 
offering is initiated.  The securitizer or underwriter engages one or more credit rating 
agencies to analyze the transaction and assign ratings to securities that reflect the 
securities’ likelihood of default and expected loss given default.  Finally, the securitizer 
hires an investment bank as an underwriter to market the securities.  For many ABS 
transactions, the underwriter and the securitizer are affiliated entities. 
Because the securitizer is a primary decision point for assets being securitized, 
application of risk retention requirements to the securitizer can be an effective way of 
creating an incentive for the monitoring of the credit quality of the assets it securitizes 
(regardless of the identity of the originator). 
ORIGINATOR 
Section 941 defines an originator as a person who “(A) through the extension of credit or 
otherwise, creates a financial asset that collateralizes an asset-backed security; and (B) 
sells that asset directly or indirectly to a securitizer.”  An originator makes the initial 
decision about whether, and on what terms, to extend credit to a business, consumer or 
homeowner and often provides initial short-term funding.  Originators include banks, 
thrifts, subsidiaries of bank or thrift holding companies, independent finance companies, 
and finance companies affiliated with vehicle, equipment, or other types of manufactures.  
                                                 
35  Further, Section 941 requires that the rules shall provide for “the allocation of risk retention obligations between a securitizer and an originator 
in the case of a securitizer that purchases assets from an originator, as the Federal banking agencies and the Commission jointly determine 
appropriate.”  15 U.S.C. § 78o-11(c)(1)(G)(iv).  In doing so, the percentage of risk retention required to be held by the securitizer must be 
reduced by the percentage retained by the originator.  15 U.S.C. § 78o-11(d)(1).   
 - 23 - 
The originator may securitize the loans directly or sell them to an aggregator that may 
buy loans from many different originators.  Aggregators are intermediaries between 
originators and securitizers, and loans may pass through several such parties’ hands 
before being securitized.  
Ultimately, having an originator retain an economic interest in the securitization can 
improve its incentives to originate high quality assets.  To the extent the originator has 
ongoing responsibilities, risk retention can better align incentives with the investor. 
THIRD-PARTIES  
CMBS TRANSACTIONS   
Section 941 prescribes that for securities backed by commercial mortgages, the 
Agencies may adopt rules regarding the “retention of the first-loss position by a third-
party purchaser that specifically negotiates for the purchase of such first loss position, 
holds adequate financial resources to back losses, provides due diligence on all 
individual assets in the pool before the issuance of the asset-backed securities, and 
meets the same standards for risk retention as the Federal banking agencies and the 
Commission require of the securitizer.” 
Section 941 thus explicitly contemplates that the Agencies could determine that a 
first-loss exposure by a third-party purchaser, under certain conditions, could satisfy 
the risk retention requirements.  In CMBS, the most junior tranche (commonly 
referred to as the “B piece”) is usually purchased by a commercial real estate 
specialist that focuses on understanding and managing the credit risk associated with 
this junior tranche.  In many cases, these buyers are the “special servicers,” or 
servicers tasked to manage loans that become troubled during the life of the 
transaction.  These parties usually conduct due diligence on individual loans and / or 
properties while the securitization is being assembled, and may have more 
information than other investors about the quality of the underlying pool of assets. 
THIRD-PARTY CREDIT GUARANTORS 
A risk retention framework could consider allowing a third party guarantor to satisfy 
risk retention requirements by taking part or all of the credit risk.  The residential 
mortgage securitization market evolved to allow a number of third parties to provide 
external credit support, either to the underlying loans or the securities.  Of particular 
note are Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration (and other 
 - 24 - 
government agencies), private mortgage insurance (“PMI”) providers, and bond 
insurers.  
AMOUNT  
There are several choices in how to structure the amount of risk that should be retained for a 
particular securitization.  This amount could be applied uniformly across all securitizations 
and across time.  Alternatively, the amount could vary based on the quality and 
characteristics of the particular assets securitized and on the economic environment that 
exists at the time of securitization.  Section 941 provides the Agencies with exemptive 
authority to make adjustments as they deem appropriate within guidelines provided by the 
statute. 
There may be benefits in adjusting the amount of risk retention for different quality assets, as 
adjustments can more appropriately align risk retention with expected loss.  For example, a  
5 percent risk retention requirement may not be necessary for high quality assets.  In other 
cases, 5 percent may not be sufficient to incent better underwriting standards for pools with 
higher expected loss.  Some have suggested adjusting risk retention based on various metrics 
that reflect the expected performance of the underlying assets. Risk retention might also be 
adjusted over time in conjunction with economic cycles, a possibility that is addressed in 
more detail in Section VI. 
On the other hand, a standardized rule applied uniformly may allow for greater transparency, 
measurability, and certainty of implementation.  However, some metrics that adjust to reflect 
expected performance may not apply appropriately to all asset classes, and may be difficult 
to measure with confidence ex ante. 
Therefore, when designing a risk retention framework, the benefits of better incenting actions 
by uniquely tailoring the amount of risk retention to the characteristics of an asset pool 
should be carefully balanced with the increased complexity and potential for regulators to set 
levels effectively. 
HEDGING, PREVENTION OF ARBITRAGE, AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
To improve effectiveness, risk retention should result in meaningful and continued exposure 
to the credit risk of the securitization.  Therefore, without proper restrictions, the use of 
hedging and other arbitrage practices could ultimately undermine the goals of the Dodd-
Frank Act risk retention requirements.  On the other hand, the financial system benefits by 
allowing financial institutions to maintain robust risk management practices.  Almost all 
financial institutions employ a risk department that oversees other risk taking parts of the 
firm to minimize the probability that external shocks and internal risk positions would cause 
 - 25 - 
large losses due to unexpected market changes.  Some of these institutions are also overseen 
by prudential regulators, who also have an interest in ensuring that financial institutions 
maintain safe and sound risk management practices. 
Therefore, balancing the prohibition of hedging with the goal of allowing firms to manage 
their overall risk exposure will be important in aligning incentives and maintaining a safe and 
sound financial system.  A risk retention framework, which itself is meant to reduce risks to 
financial stability, should not unduly prevent other types of risk mitigation.  
EXEMPTIONS THROUGH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS  
While risk retention is the focus of Section 941, it also requires, for certain asset classes, 
partial or total exemptions of asset-backed securities where the underlying loans meet strong 
underwriting policies and standards.  In this regard, exemptions could take into account a 
borrower’s history of debt repayment, the borrower’s current and anticipated capacity to 
make debt payments, and the quality and value of the collateral securing repayment.  Such 
exemptions, in combination with risk retention requirements, may further incent strong 
underwriting practices. 
The Qualified Residential Mortgage (“QRM”) as defined in Section 941 provides an 
exemption for residential mortgage loans that have underwriting and product features that 
historical loan performance data indicate result in a low risk of default.36  Section 941 also 
requires that the standards for a QRM be no broader than the standards established for 
“Qualified Mortgages” as defined under Section 129C of the Truth in Lending Act.37  
Agencies are also required under Section 941 to prescribe underwriting standards for three 
non-residential asset classes: auto loans, commercial loans, and commercial mortgages.  For 
loans originated under these standards, risk retention must be less than 5 percent.  
Implementation of exemptions based on underwriting standards could include: 
 Explicit quantitative standards whereby clearly defined standards are set.  Under such a 
framework specific, standards and values could be established in which no loan could 
exceed in order to qualify under the exemption.  For example, regulators could set a 
specific total debt-to-income ratio or loan-to-value ratio without exceptions. 
 An automated underwriting model that allows for compensating factors.  Under such a 
framework, a borrower’s credit history could be offset with an increased down payment 
and lower loan-to-value ratio.  Therefore, an automated underwriting model would not set

a numerical value for any standard, but instead could provide a range of values with 
corresponding formulas that allow for different combinations of standards.   
Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks.  The first framework allows for simplicity, 
but may result in certain loans of creditworthy borrowers otherwise failing to qualify for an 
exemption.  However, those borrowers may be able to obtain loans subject to the risk 
retention framework.  The second framework, while potentially better able to account for 
creditworthiness due to offsetting factors, is much more complex and would place a material 
burden on regulators to create a full set of standards across many asset classes appropriately.

VI. ADJUSTING RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS   
CALIBRATING RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS 
Implementing risk retention requirements in the securitization process could potentially mitigate 
some of the destabilizing effects that securitization has on the credit cycle and, more generally, 
macroeconomic conditions. 
To the extent risk retention can help avoid deterioration in underwriting standards, it may 
safeguard against a recurrence of the excessive expansion of credit that led to the home price 
bubble in the recent crisis.  In addition to improving the incentive structure in securitization, risk 
retention could diminish the amount of credit available by tying up cash that would otherwise be 
used to make additional loans – an effect that could further mitigate some of the pro-cyclicality 
in credit supply that has been attributed to securitization. 
There is limited literature on the macroeconomic effects of risk retention to date, but available 
academic literature suggests that securitizations that have some form of risk retention may 
perform better, because risk retention helps to align incentives between originators and 
investors.38  The relative performance of various types of asset-backed securities during the 
financial crisis also provides some evidence of the effectiveness of risk retention requirements in 
this regard.   
Risk retention requirements may help mitigate pro-cyclicality in credit formation and real estate 
values, contributing to the stability of the financial system, the real estate sector, and the 
economy.  Setting the risk retention requirements at a level that maximizes these benefits while 
minimizing costs is important.  Risk retention requirements that are too weak can impose 
substantial costs, as can requirements that are too stringent.  An excessive requirement could 
unduly limit credit availability and economic output to the point that these costs could outweigh 
the benefits of improved stability.  A weak requirement, however, could reduce long-run growth 
by increasing risks to financial stability. 
An increase in credit costs could constrain credit supply, but this may not be, in and of itself, a 
negative consequence of risk retention.  Interest rates on securitized mortgages in the period 
leading up to the crisis did not reflect the real risks of unsustainable lending to private parties, the 
financial system, and the economy.  Low private costs for credit were not sustainable because 
they did not internalize all of the social costs of credit expansion to the entire system.  To the 
extent that risk retention helps the market determine prices that reflect true private and public

the risk associated with the loans that banks make provides such incentives.  By spreading or removing the risk, securitization may reduce the 
bank’s incentives to screen borrowers.  See G. Gorton and G. Pennacchi, "Banks and Loan Sales: Marketing Non-Marketable Assets," Journal 
of Monetary Economics, vol. 35, no. 3 (1995).

costs of securitization, an increase in credit costs to sustainable levels would contribute to growth 
by promoting more efficient resource allocation. 
CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING STATIC AND PROACTIVE ADJUSTMENT OF RISK 
RETENTION 
Section 946 requires consideration of whether risk retention requirements and mortgage 
origination requirements should be static or dynamic.  In practice, a static framework would only 
be adjusted infrequently in response to structural changes in credit markets.  In contrast, a 
dynamic framework would be adjusted more frequently in a counter-cyclical manner.  Each 
approach has costs and benefits that should be considered. 
Static regulations have the benefit of being transparent and providing certainty to market 
participants, but may not be responsive to changing market conditions.  This may allow market 
participants to make longer-term plans for savings and investment.  The existing literature notes 
that fixed rules may provide for greater predictability.39  Static regulations are less complex for 
regulators.  On the other hand, if regulators set risk retention requirements at an inappropriate 
level, or design them in an inappropriate manner, the costs in terms of lost long-term output 
could outweigh the benefits of the regulations.  Additionally, fixed rules may not allow for 
judgment to be applied as economic conditions change.40  If regulators are not responsive to 
innovation and changes in financial conditions, the regulations could become less applicable and 
the benefits of risk retention may decline.  
By contrast, dynamic regulation could either be automatic, utilizing pre-determined formulas, or 
set by regulators on a discretionary basis.  Some academic literature suggests that changing 
conditions should be monitored by regulators over time, implying that there may be benefits to 
changing regulation to address emerging risks to the system.41  In the case of automatic 
regulation, the required amount of risk retention could be tied to the business cycle or financial 
market indicators in a formulaic manner.  Regulations could be written to contain a counter-
cyclical formula linking risk retention or underwriting standards to, for example, home prices.  In 
this example, required risk retention could increase automatically as the economy grows and 
home prices rise, in order to constrain unsustainable increases in credit supply that could 
potentially fuel emerging bubbles.  Alternatively, as the economy slows and home prices fall, the 
level of retention could fall automatically to encourage credit flows and to avoid recessions.

Such dynamic regulation could address potential cyclicality in credit formation.  However, 
determining the precise formula by which retention would be tied to the business cycle could 
pose significant challenges to policymakers, as the understanding of formulaic linkages between 
risk retention, credit supply and macroeconomic conditions may not be sufficiently robust to do 
so at high levels of confidence.  Additionally, such relationships may change over time, 
potentially reducing the benefits of dynamic regulation conducted using pre-determined 
quantitative inputs, absent ongoing regulatory intervention.   
Another type of dynamic regulation would allow regulators to adjust the regulations on a more 
discretionary basis.  This would allow regulators to change underwriting standards or risk 
retention requirements in response to economic and financial developments, including financial 
innovation.  However, requiring regulators to make changes to regulations in response to the 
business cycle may pose challenges, both in theory and practice, as it requires regulators to make 
determinations regarding the impact such changes may have on the business cycle, and to make 
such changes quickly.  Additionally, the existing literature also notes that allowance for 
regulatory discretion can lead to a bias towards forbearance.42  Some suggest that regulatory 
independence may be an important factor in ensuring that unpopular rules can be implemented 
when necessary.43   
Accordingly, the Agencies should act prudently in setting out the rules associated with risk 
retention requirements and associated exemptions.  Following the implementation of the risk 
retention rules, regulators should take into account the changing nature of markets and future 
innovations and whether such rules should be adjusted accordingly.

VII. CONCLUSION 
Securitization is an important source of credit formation for the economy, allowing market 
participants to draw efficiently upon a wide variety of sources of capital and investment, both to 
lower costs and diversify risk.  As discussed above, some of the benefits of securitization include 
reducing the cost of credit for borrowers and improving mechanisms for financial institutions to 
manage interest rate risk.  However, absent safeguards, there are inherent risks in the 
securitization process that can detract from these benefits.  These risks have historically included 
misaligned incentives among participants in the securitization process, a lack of disclosure and 
transparency, and investor overreliance on CRAs.  The Dodd-Frank Act mandates many reforms 
to address these issues, including risk retention requirements. 
Risk retention serves as an important tool that, if properly structured, has the potential to address 
misaligned incentives and the deterioration in underwriting standards — two critical problems 
that had a significant impact on businesses, consumers, and homeowners in the United States.  It 
is important to note that while risk retention can help mitigate some of these inherent risks, it 
does not solve all of the problems in the securitization process and may not be appropriate in all 
cases.  Therefore, risk retention must be considered in conjunction with other reforms in the 
Dodd-Frank Act as well as other reforms occurring both domestically and internationally. 
The academic literature indicates that there may be a connection between asset-backed 
securitization and an exacerbation of pro-cyclical lending.  Misaligned incentives and a 
deterioration in underwriting standards may have implications on the broader economy if they 
lead to excess lending in periods of growth and a greater contraction of credit during periods of 
stress.  Some academic literature suggests that securitization may have contributed to an 
expansion of credit in the run-up to the financial crisis, which in turn facilitated increases in 
housing prices and worsened the ensuing contraction in credit when the housing bubble burst. 
Based on the available literature, there is evidence that risk retention could minimize the pro-
cyclical macroeconomic effects of securitization by aligning incentives and improving 
underwriting standards.  On the other hand, if risk retention requirements are too stringent, they 
could constrain lending, and consequently, the formation of credit.   
Accordingly, it is important to design a risk retention framework that maximizes the benefits of 
asset-backed securitization as a source of credit formation and minimizes the inherent risks of an 
originate-to-distribute model.  Such a framework should allow for efficient allocation of capital, 
where market participants accurately price credit risk.  As observed in the most recent crisis, 
market participants did not always internalize the true cost of the credit extended.  To the extent 
that risk retention and other reforms can help address efficient capital allocation, they can serve 
to facilitate stable economic growth.

APPENDIX 
APPENDIX A: OTHER RELEVANT SECTIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT  
RATING AGENCIES - TITLE IX, SUBTITLE C 
Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act must be properly regulated and have a strong set of 
incentives to accurately rate securities in order to perform their role and provide 
meaningful and reliable ratings.  The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions 
that are intended to improve the quality and transparency of credit ratings, address 
conflicts of interest, reduce reliance on credit ratings, and require additional studies on 
future changes to the structure of credit rating agencies. 
Specifically, Subtitle C removes statutory references to credit ratings from certain statutes 
and requires each Federal agency to review its regulations for references to credit ratings 
and replace these references with a standard of creditworthiness.  The SEC must also 
conduct a study on (i) the independence of credit rating agencies and how this 
independence affects the ratings they issue; (ii) the feasibility and desirability of 
standardizing credit rating terminology; and (iii) the feasibility of establishing a public or 
private utility or self regulatory agency for assigning credit rating agencies to issuers to 
determine the ratings of structured finance products.  The Comptroller General (“GAO”) 
must conduct a study on alternative means for compensating credit rating agencies in 
order to create incentives for more accurate credit ratings.  The GAO must also conduct a 
study on the feasibility and merits of creating an independent professional organization 
that would establish independent standards for governing the rating analyst profession. 
DISCLOSURE - TITLE IX, SUBTITLE D, SECTION 942 AND 945 
Section 942 and 945 addresses disclosure and information transparency.  Section 942 
mandates that the SEC adopt regulations requiring issuers of an ABS to disclose 
information regarding assets backing each tranche or class of the security and to set 
standards for the format of the data provided.  Section 945 mandates that the SEC issue 
rules that the registration statement filed by issuers of ABS includes a review by the 
issuer of the assets underlying the ABS and disclose the nature of the review. 
 - 32 - 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES - TITLE IX, SUBTITLE D, SECTION 943 
Section 943 mandates that the SEC prescribe regulations regarding disclosure of 
representations and warranties in the ABS market, whereby each rating agency must 
include in their report a description of the representations, warranties, and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors and state how these differ from similarly issued 
securities.  The SEC must also require securitizers to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled 
repurchase requests across all trusts aggregated by the securitizers.  
UNDERWRITING PROCESS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION – TITLE XIV, SECTION 1412 
Section 1412 requires the Federal Reserve Board (and the Consumer Finance Protection 
Bureau once transferred) in consultation with the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture, and Rural 
Housing Service, defines standards for a Qualified Mortgage (QM), which reflects a 
borrower’s ability to repay, ensuring that responsible and affordable mortgage credit 
remains available to homeowners.  While the section lists criteria, it leaves ultimate 
discretion to the rule writer.  Suggested criteria include: restrictions on payment 
structures where the principle balance increases over time, fully amortizing fixed rate 
loans, taking into account fees, taxes, and assessments, placing limits on fees, and 
qualification for adjustable rate mortgages based on the maximum rate a borrower might 
pay during the first five years, among others. 
APPENDIX B: OTHER RELEVANT REGULATORY INITIATIVES 
BASEL ACCORD REFORMS 
Following the financial crisis, on December 16, 2010 the BCBS announced stricter 
capital regulatory requirements for banks, which are commonly known as Basel III.  
Previously, in July 2009 the BCBS strengthened supervisory standards and increased 
regulatory capital requirements for complex securitizations.  The BCBS adopted several 
revisions to the regulatory framework known as Basel II to address some of the main 
issues that arose during the crisis.  Basel III is intended to improve the banking sector's 
ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress.  Basel III must be 
individually adopted by the regulators of each participating nation and is to be phased in 
beginning January 1, 2013.  These standards include requirements for banks to have: (i) 
heightened risk weight for some lower-rated and unrated securitization exposures; (ii) 
more conservative collateral haircuts for securitization collateral with respect to 
 - 33 - 
counterparty exposure; and (iii) additional specific risk haircuts for securitization 
exposures when calculating the capital requirement related to market risk.  
STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOS. 166 AND 16744  
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial 
Accounting Statements 166 and 167, which change the way entities account for 
securitizations and special-purpose entities to better align financial accounting disclosure 
practices with the actual risks of asset-backed securitization.  These statements were 
effective for companies’ first fiscal year that began after November 15, 2009 and January 
1, 2010 for companies reporting on a calendar year basis.  The statements require banks 
to consolidate on their balance sheets certain securitized assets as well as other financial 
assets that were previously disclosed as off-balance sheet assets if certain standards of 
control are met.45  While these consolidation standards primarily respond to the risks 
associated with off-balance sheet securitization and the need for better disclosure, they 
also have implications for earnings and regulatory capital of on-balance sheet securitized 
assets.  In some cases, the cost of reserving capital against the consolidated securitization 
assets may reduce the attractiveness of using securitization structures and incentivize 
investors to use other means to fund loan origination.   
While it is unclear what impact that mandatory risk retention will have on consolidation 
analysis, it is clear that accounting treatment for securitization structures will differ based 
on characteristics of that structure and the distribution of economic interest among 
investors and entities affiliated with the transaction.46  While risk retention’s potential 
impact on the accounting treatment of securitization may vary, the requirements 
associated with consolidation have material consequences on earnings and capital 
allocation for affected entities.  
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS - ARTICLE 122A 
Article 122a is an amendment to the European Capital Requirements Directive that was 
adopted by the European Parliament in May 2009.  The amendment, among other things, 
introduces a new originator retention requirement and significantly strengthens investor 
due diligence obligations, with capital sanctions in the event of non-compliance.  In

December 2010, the Committee of European Bank Supervisors (CEBS) issued final 
guidelines with respect to the application of Article 122a. 
Article 122a’s provisions will apply to new securitizations issued after December 31, 
2010 and after December 31, 2014 for existing securitizations where underlying 
exposures are subject to addition or substitution after that date (i.e., master trusts and 
some CDO structures).  Article 122a applies to any EU credit institution that invests in or 
holds securitization positions in either its banking book or trading book.  Additionally, 
for an issuer to sell tranches of structured finance securities to European credit 
institutions, it will be necessary for non-European institutions to comply with Article 
122a.  For example, if an EU or US auto ABS issuer wants to sell auto loan ABS tranches 
to a European credit institution, it will need to comply with the EU retention 
requirements and also provide sufficient information for EU investor due diligence. 
Article 122a provides a range of options to the market with regards to the form of risk 
retention, including: (i) vertical retention of risk not less than 5 percent of the nominal 
value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors; (ii) retention of risk not 
less than 5 percent of the nominal value of the securitized exposure in case of revolving 
securitizations; (iii) equivalent exposure though retention of risk of randomly selected 
exposures equal to not less than 5 percent of the nominal amount of the securitized 
exposures, where there would otherwise have been securitized in the securitization 
provided that the number of potentially securitized exposures is not less than 100 at 
origination; and (iv) horizontal retention of risk of the first loss tranche and if necessary 
other tranches having the same or more severe risk profile and not maturing any earlier 
than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals no less than 5 
percent of the nominal value of the securitized exposures.  
Article 122a provides an important example of risk retention strategies currently being 
pursued by regulatory bodies outside of the United States.
