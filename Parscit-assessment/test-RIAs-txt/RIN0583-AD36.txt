I. Introduction
For purposes of this analysis, the proposed rule being 
considered by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has 
been designated by the Office of Management and Budget as 
significant and is being evaluated as required by Executive 
Order 12866. 
A. Current Regulatory Framework
Catfish slaughtering and processing establishments, catfish 
and catfish products further processing establishments, 
exporters, and importers are subject to the Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) seafood HACCP regulations in 9 CFR 123 and 
other requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FFDCA).  FDA’s regulations on current good manufacturing 
practices (cGMPs, in 21 CFR 110) also apply to these 
establishments.  For catfish producers, FDA provides advice and 
assistance through its Good Aquaculture Practices Program 
(GAqPs).  However, FDA does not provide a continuous inspection 
program.
About 18 of 23 slaughtering and processing catfish 
establishments have contracted for voluntary, fee-for-service 
inspection and certification programs administered by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanographic 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of 
Commerce. 
NMFS administers three levels of seafood inspection 
programs under authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act (7 
U.S.C. 1622, 1624) and regulations implementing that act (50 CFR 
260).  These are: (1) a resident inspection program, which 
provides continuous inspection to qualifying establishments; (2) 
an integrated quality assurance program, under which an 
establishment operates an NMFS-approved quality assurance system 
and assists NMFS personnel in carrying out U.S. grading or 
specification regulations; and (3) a HACCP-Quality Management 
Program (QMP), under which the establishment’s quality program 
is enhanced to meet the ISO 9001 quality management standards. 
An establishment that participates in the continuous 
inspection program must agree to prepare products using only 
wholesome raw materials and to correctly label inspected items.  
The establishment must also agree to prior label approval by 
NMFS and to furnish it with reports that it may request on 
processing, packaging, grading, laboratory analysis, and 
production of inspected products.  The establishment must 
provide facilities to NMFS inspectors and agree to conditions 
under which inspection may be suspended or terminated (50 CFR 
260.97).
7
 
 
 
  
 
The premises of the establishment must be free from 
conditions that may result in food contamination (50 CFR 
260.98).  Buildings and structures must be equipped with 
adequate lighting, ventilation, drains and gutters, and hot and 
cold water.  Facilities must be of sound construction and 
capable of being thoroughly cleaned.  Processing rooms must be 
so designed and constructed as to permit clean and orderly 
processing and operating conditions.  Birds, dogs, cats, and 
other animals must be excluded from rooms where processed 
products are being prepared, handled, or stored.  Insects and 
other pests must also be excluded.  The use of chemical 
compounds, such as cleaning agents, insecticides, rodenticides, 
and bactericides must be limited to circumstances and conditions 
approved by NMFS (50 CFR 260.99).
An establishment participating in any of the inspection 
programs is expected to have organized food-safety management 
systems that provide for effective internal and external 
communications, management review, and resources adequate for 
maintaining a sound food safety program.  This food safety 
program is implemented through a combination of operational 
prerequisite programs that document how food safety hazards are 
to be controlled and HACCP plans for each product processed by 
the establishment.  HACCP plans must be validated.
8
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
The establishment is expected to document how it would
control nonconforming products, handle recalls, and withdraw 
defective products from the market.  All HACCP-related records 
must be available to NMFS inspectors.
The establishment must maintain documented Sanitation 
Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOPs) and prerequisite 
programs.  The programs must ensure the safety of processing 
water, prevent contamination of food-contact surfaces, and 
prevent cross-contamination generally in the establishment. 
Through its sanitation program, the establishment must 
ensure adequate hand washing, hand sanitation, and toilet 
facilities for its employees; protection of edible products from 
adulteration; the proper labeling, use, and storage of toxic 
compounds.  The program must ensure that pests are excluded from 
the establishment.
B. Need for Regulatory Action
Although catfish, like other fish, are subject to FDA 
regulations, the 2008 Farm Bill amended the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act (FMIA) to provide that “catfish, as defined by 
the Secretary,” is an amenable species (21 U.S.C. 601 (w)(2)). 
Catfish and catfish products are therefore subject to continuous 
inspection under the FMIA, which FSIS administers.  The 2008 
Farm Bill (Sec. 11016) stipulates that the FMIA amendments are 
not to apply until USDA issues implementing regulations and that 
9
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
     
 
      
      
 
  
  
final regulations to carry out the amendments must issue no 
later than 18 months after the date of enactment (June 18, 2008) 
of the legislation, or December 2009. Thus, this regulatory 
action is necessary to implement this statutory mandate.
C. Proposed Actions 
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing 
regulations requiring continuous inspection of catfish and 
catfish products.  The regulations would require that catfish 
and catfish products produced and sold in commerce intended for 
use as human food are safe, wholesome, not adulterated, and 
properly marked, labeled, and packaged consistent with the FMIA.  
Under the FMIA, FSIS intends to apply to catfish and 
catfish food products most provisions of the Act that now apply 
to meat and meat food products. 
1. Definition of Catfish
The 2008 Farm Bill designated that the Secretary of the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is to determine 
the definition of catfish.  The eventual decision regarding the 
definition of “catfish” would determine the scope of the FSIS 
inspection program.  This FSIS analysis considered two possible 
definitions.  One possible definition is catfish native to North 
America that belong to the family Ictaluridae.  Another possible 
definition is all fish of the order Siluriformes.  If catfish 
10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
     
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
      
 
  
are eventually defined as all fish of the order Siluriformes, 
FSIS would inspect domestically produced catfish and would re­
inspect all imported catfish.  If eventually defined as fish 
only of the family Ictaluridae, FSIS would inspect domestically 
produced catfish and would re-inspect approximately 20-25
percent of imported Siluriformes. 
USDA is asking for public comments on the scope of the 
definition and would fully define and describe the term in the 
final rule.
Following is FSIS’s projected costs and benefits of 
implementing the proposed catfish inspection system, under FSIS 
jurisdiction using the two different definitions. The first 
scenario (hereafter designated as scenario #1) would bring under 
the requirements of the FMIA and regulations implementing it a 
definition of “catfish” as any member of the order Siluriformes,
including the family Ictaluridae, as well as other families and 
species, such as members of the family Pangasiidae -- basa, tra, 
swai -- and members of the Clariidae family that are commonly 
farm-raised in overseas locations and exported to the United 
States.
In addition, FSIS analyzed a definition of “catfish” as any
member of the common farm-raised species of the North American 
family Ictaluridae -- channel catfish, blue catfish, and hybrid 
channel-blue catfish.  This scenario (hereafter designated as 
11
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
  
  
       
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
scenario #2) would be subject to the same proposed requirements 
as in scenario #1. 
Other key features or provisions of the proposed rule for 
the mandatory inspection of catfish and catfish food products 
are summarized in Table 1 and outlined below:
2. Applying the Requirements in the FMIA to Processing
Establishments
Under this proposal, FSIS would apply the requirements in 
the FMIA to the inspection of the processing of catfish and 
catfish food products, taking account of the conditions under 
which the catfish are raised and transported to the processing
establishment (21 U.S.C. §606). NMFS’s Seafood Inspection 
Program currently applies the requirements of 21 U.S.C. §608 in 
the facilities it inspects.
FSIS would apply the FMIA provisions for the destruction of 
condemned products and for the inspection and certification of 
products to be exported (21 U.S.C. 606). FSIS would also apply 
the sanitation regulations to, and would inspect the conditions 
of sanitation in, the processing establishments for catfish and 
catfish products (21 U.S.C. 608).  
The FMIA, as amended, effectively prohibits the sale, 
transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receipt for 
transportation, in commerce, of any catfish or catfish product 
12
 
 
 
 
       
  
   
 
  
 
  
      
 
intended for use as human food that has not been inspected and 
passed by FSIS (21 U.S.C. 610).
3. Pre-harvest Provisions – Production and Transportation
Under this proposal, FSIS would take account of the
conditions under which the catfish are raised and transported to 
the processing establishment. Catfish for human food must have 
grown and lived under conditions that would not render them 
unsound, unwholesome, unhealthy, or otherwise unfit for human 
food. FSIS advises producers to monitor pond water and 
sediments for suspended solids, organic matter, nutrients, heavy 
metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and industrial chemicals. FSIS 
would sample feed, fish, and pond water and sediments.
A vehicle used to transport catfish to a processing 
establishment would need to contain sufficient water and oxygen 
to ensure that the catfish that arrive at the establishment are 
not adulterated under proposed 9 CFR 531.1 and 21 U.S.C. 
601(m)(5) in that they have died otherwise than by slaughter.  
4. Import Requirements
With respect to products of foreign origin, the FMIA 
prohibits their importation if they are adulterated or 
misbranded, and unless they were produced under conditions that 
comply with all the inspection, building construction standards, 
and other provisions of the FMIA and regulations that are 
applicable to similar products in the United States. Imported 
13
 
 
 
 
      
 
 
        
 
 
        
products must meet the inspection, sanitary, quality, species 
verification, and residue standards that apply to United States 
products.
5. FSIS Inspection Provisions
Under the FMIA, FSIS must appoint inspectors to examine and 
inspect all amenable species and their products that are 
intended for food.  These provisions would apply with respect to 
catfish and catfish products inspection.
a. Access to Premises, Inventory, and Records
The Act requires persons engaged in business as meat 
brokers or wholesalers, or in the transportation, storage, or 
importation of any carcasses, parts or products of carcasses, of 
animals for human food to give authorized representatives of the 
Secretary access to their places of businesses.  The 
representatives have the right to examine the facilities, 
inventory, and records of the businesses, and to take reasonable 
samples of their inventory upon payment of the fair market value 
for the samples.
b. Registration of Affected Businesses
Persons engaged in business as meat brokers, renderers, 
animal food manufacturers, wholesalers of carcasses, parts, or 
products of amenable species intended for human food or other 
purposes, and other types of business involving the handling of 
animal carcasses and parts must, when required by regulations, 
14
 
 
 
 
 
        
            
  
 
 
 
         
 
 
         
  
 
register with the Department and hence FSIS (21 U.S.C. 643).  In 
addition, producers must be registered with FSIS. Live-fish 
haulers may need to be registered with FSIS, if they are 
independent businesses.
c. State-Federal, Federal-State Cooperative Inspection
Programs
The FMIA provides for FSIS cooperation with State agencies 
in the development and administration of State meat inspection 
programs that impose standards that are at least equal to those 
of the Federal program. In some cases, FSIS may provide 
advisory and technical assistance, as well as funding (up to 50 
percent of the total cost of the program), to achieve this 
objective (21 U.S.C. 645(a)).
d. Exemptions for Retail or Restaurant Operations
With respect to the preparation of carcasses, parts, meat 
and meat food products of amenable species, including catfish,  
operations of types traditionally and usually conducted in 
retail outlet stores and restaurants are subject to exemption 
from Federal inspection (21 U.S.C. 645).
e. Billing Overtime and Holiday Inspection Services
The cost of the Federal meat inspection service – catfish 
and catfish products inspection service – is to be borne by the 
United States.  The cost of overtime and holiday inspection is 
15
 
 
 
 
        
 
 
 
    
 
charged to the recipient of the service under 7 U.S.C. 2219a (21 
U.S.C. 695).
f. Mandatory Sanitation SOPs and HACCP Plans
FSIS is proposing regulations that would require catfish
and catfish products slaughtering and processing establishments, 
and catfish and catfish products further processing food 
establishments to develop, validate, and implement Pathogen 
Reduction (PR) Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) Systems and Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures 
(Sanitation SOPs).  In addition, processing establishments would 
develop and continue pre-requisite programs for process control.
FSIS would inspect and verify catfish and catfish product 
establishments’ compliance with food safety standards and 
related requirements.  FSIS would structure inspection 
activities so inspection program personnel can focus on areas of 
greatest risk in the catfish and catfish product processing 
system within each establishment, on the ability of 
establishments to maintain a sanitary environment, and to ensure 
that catfish and catfish products leaving facilities are safe.
g.  New Labels
The proposal would require new labels that have the 
official USDA inspection legend including the phrase “inspected 
and passed” on catfish and catfish product packages, and safe 
handling labels on packages of not ready-to-eat catfish and 
16
 
 
 
 
        
  
 
        
     
 
        
     
 
catfish products, and raw catfish and catfish products. The 
proposal would require catfish and catfish products to bear 
labeling with the same features as for meat and meat food 
products, such as product name, brand name, ingredients, and 
place of manufacture. In addition, the proposal has retained 
water requirements for raw catfish and catfish products: 100­
percent net weight and deglazed net weight to average 100 
percent of net weight after thawing.  Furthermore, the proposal 
has nutrition labeling requirements.
h.  Ready-to-eat (RTE) Products
The proposal would make ready-to-eat (RTE) catfish and 
catfish products, such as cooked, and dried or smoked catfish 
products – subject to requirements for the control of Listeria 
monocytogenes.
i.  Export Requirements
The proposal requires affixing of stamps and marking of 
products for exports. FSIS issues export certificates that are 
required for clearance of vessels and transportation to foreign 
destinations.
j.  Government Office Space and Equipment Requirements
The proposal requires provision of Government office space 
and some equipment in each of the catfish and catfish products 
slaughter and processing establishments, and catfish and catfish 
products further processing food establishments.
17
 
 
        
      
  
      
      
 
 
    
 
 
k.  Records Requirements
The proposal requires persons engaged in catfish- and 
catfish product-related businesses to keep records of 
transactions. These records include shippers’ certificates, 
seals, permits, and guaranties of suppliers. In addition, the 
proposal requires records for Sanitation SOPs, HACCP plans, and 
processing records. Records are to be kept at the place of 
business or central headquarters, for a two-year retention 
period from when the transaction occurred.
6. Implementation/Phase-in
To provide for an orderly transition from FDA’s regulatory 
program to FSIS’s more intensive continuous inspection program, 
FSIS is proposing a phased-in approach to implementation of the 
final rule that establishes the new mandatory catfish inspection 
program. During the transition period, FSIS is seeking to 
provide establishments and foreign countries that would be 
subject to the final rule with the opportunity to train their 
personnel and to bring their operations into compliance with the 
new regulations. (Comments have been invited on the appropriate 
length and nature of the transition period.)
Table 1 shows the key features or provisions of the proposed

Proposal
Scenarios
Scenario #1 includes: Scenario #2 includes:
Determination of 
the definition of 
“catfish” that is 
done by the 
Secretary of the 
United States 
Department of 
Agriculture (USDA)
- Siluriformes definition
- Farm-raised “catfish”
- order Siluriformes
- Members include the members 
of the family Ictaluridae, 
such as -- channel catfish, 
blue catfish, and flathead 
catfish --, as well as other 
species, such as catfish 
members of the family
Pangasiidae -- basa, tra, swai 
-- and catfish members of the 
family Clariidae that are 
commonly farm-raised in 
overseas locations and
exported to the United States.
-Ictaluridae definition

FSIS compared (in Table 2) the overview authority between
FDA, NOAA, and FSIS for catfish and catfish food products.
With the proposal to require continuous inspection of catfish 
and catfish food products, FSIS would incur the costs of 
establishing a new program.  The domestic catfish industry would 
have to make marginal changes to comply with the proposed 
requirements. A difference between the requirements of the 
three agencies is FSIS’s requirement for Sanitation Standard 
Operating Procedures (SSOP). Further differences are FSIS’s 
more expansive import inspection and more testing for detecting 
adulterants.

II.  Farm-Raised Catfish and Catfish Products Baseline 
A.  Farm-Raised Catfish and Catfish Products Domestic Industry
Discussion throughout this section is focused on 
domestically raised Ictaluridae.  The National Agriculture
Statistics Service (NASS) of the Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) reports that there are approximately 1,300 Ictaluridae
catfish farms in 16 states (USDA/NASS 2009).  These Ictaluridae
catfish farms are small entities that typically employ less than 
20 persons.  The majority of United States Ictaluridae catfish 
production ponds acreage and sales are in Mississippi, Arkansas, 
Alabama, and Louisiana.  The combined production pond acreage of 
these 4 states makes up about 94% of all Ictaluridae catfish 
production ponds acreage.  In 2007, total sales from these 4
states made up approximately 96% of all domestically raised 
Ictaluridae catfish sales.
Domestically raised Ictaluridae catfish is the leading 
aquaculture industry in the United States. Commercial 
Ictaluridae catfish production generates over 46% of the value 
of aquaculture production in the United States.  From the first 
commercial production in ponds in the 1960s, Ictaluridae catfish 
production grew to reach annual sales of 660 million pounds 
(live weight) in 2003.  However, U.S. catfish production dropped
to annual sales of about 496 million pounds (live weight) in 
2008.  The most rapid growth occurred in the 1980s as new 
23
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
  
 
technologies and markets developed rapidly.  Moreover, the rapid 
growth of the U.S. Ictaluridae catfish industry in the 1980s and 
1990s led to its becoming one of the most important agricultural 
activities in States such as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama. 
In these States, the Ictaluridae catfish industry generates an 
economic impact of billions of dollars and is the primary source 
of economic activity and employment in a number of counties.  
For example, the domestic Ictaluridae catfish industry in Chicot 
County, Arkansas, alone, generated a total economic impact of 
$359 million, $20 million in total tax revenue, and 2,534 jobs 
(46% of all employment in the county) when all direct, indirect, 
and induced effects were accounted for (Kaliba and Engle, 2004). 
The overall impact of this domestic industry is even greater 
because it is concentrated in a region of the country that is 
characterized by low levels of economic development and high 
rates of unemployment.
The southern United States has a transportation and 
communications infrastructure that facilitates transportation of 
catfish feeds from feed mills to catfish farms, fingerlings from 
fingerling producers to food catfish production facilities, food
catfish from production facilities to processing establishments, 
and miscellaneous equipment and supplies to catfish farms.  For 
marketing purposes, the lower Mississippi River alluvial plain 
24
 
 
 
 
     
 
      
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
is located within one trucking day (approximately 500 miles) of 
about one-third of the United States population.
Within the southern United States, the two major catfish-
producing areas are 1) a relatively well-defined geographical 
area of the lower Mississippi River alluvial valley that 
includes northwest Mississippi, southeast Arkansas, and 
northeast Louisiana and 2) a less well-defined area of west-
central Alabama and east-central Mississippi.
While Ictaluridae catfish production is concentrated in the 
Mississippi Delta region, there is Ictaluridae catfish produced 
in at least 16 states.  Those states (other than Mississippi, 
Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana) with more than 500 acres of 
catfish production ponds acreage in 2009 were: California, North 
Carolina, Missouri, Georgia, Florida, and Kentucky.
For scenario #1 (Siluriformes Domestic Catfish Supply 
Chain) with the Siluriformes definition of catfish, FSIS 
projects that the proposal could affect 1,439, or 83 percent, of 
1,724 domestic establishments that include Ictaluridae catfish 
producer farms, feed mills, live catfish haulers, processors, 
further processing food establishments, and importers (Table 3).
The remaining 285, or 17 percent, of 1,724 would be those 
domestic establishments and importers that would be retail 
outlet operations that would be exempt from this proposed rule.
25
 
 
 
   
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
    
  
There are an estimated 1,300 commercial catfish producer
farms in the United States that supply live Ictaluridae catfish 
to about 23 active catfish slaughtering and processing 
establishments in the United States (USDA NASS, 2009).  A NASS 
survey found 18 catfish processors that can slaughter and 
process 2,000 pounds live weight or more per 8-hour shift (USDA 
NASS, 2008). FSIS solicits information on the number and 
location of active catfish slaughtering and whole catfish and 
catfish products processing establishments in the United States. 
In addition, based on FDA inspection data (FDA, 2007), 
there are about 415 FDA inspected establishments in the United 
States that are registered to process (e.g., dressing, cutting 
portions, cooking, drying, or smoking) fish or seafood.  Based 
on discussions with FDA catfish experts, about 190, or 46
percent of these FDA registered establishments are known to have 
further processed Siluriformes catfish and catfish products 
within the past several years. However, FSIS assumes that about 
180 of these 415 establishments are retail outlet operations and 
thus they are exempt from FSIS catfish inspection.  FSIS assumes 
that about 2 percent of these 415 or about 10 establishments do 
further processing-only (i.e., smoking or cooking) of 
Siluriformes catfish or catfish products.  Furthermore, there 
are about 185 seafood wholesalers or brokers including importers
/ exporters (FDA, 2007) in the United States.  Based on 
26
 
 
 
    
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
          
                  
                  
 
                    
 
                  
 
 
                 
         
        
         
          
  
           
 
 
discussions with catfish experts, FSIS assumes that about 80 
wholesalers or brokers for these 185, or about 43 percent, would
likely be affected because, after the implementation of the 
final rule, they might bear some additional costs, or some loss 
of business because they might import less Siluriformes catfish 
or catfish food products from one of the 15 countries that 
currently export Siluriformes catfish or catfish food products 
to the United States.  The United States exports Ictaluridae
catfish and catfish food products to about 12 countries.

In addition, FSIS assumes that about 50 percent or 11 of 
the 23 domestic Siluriformes catfish and catfish products 
27
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
   
 
    
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
processors contract with about 11 loading-and-hauling firms.  
These 11 firms capture and load the live catfish into their 
approximately 66 water-tanker trucks (using approximately 6 
trucks per establishment), and then transport the catfish live 
to the processing establishments.  The remaining 12 processing 
establishments run their own catching and hauling crews using 
approximately 5 trucks per establishment or a total of about 60 
water-tankard trucks. 
Commercial domestic Ictaluridae catfish are typically 
produced in controlled aquatic environments (e.g., ponds, and 
cages placed in lakes or rivers); seined harvested; transported
or hauled alive in super-oxygenated water, sometimes water 
cooled in transit; and delivered live to a processing 
establishment often within several hours of being seined (Silva, 
2001).  In addition, Ictaluridae catfish can arrive at the 
processing establishment within an hour of where they are 
raised. Furthermore, the domestic Ictaluridae industry already 
has mandatory HACCP quality assurance programs.  Further, a 
large share of the industry conducts third party audits of their 
catfish and catfish products processing practices. 
Domestic and foreign raised Siluriformes catfish and 
catfish products constitute a growing share of total freshwater 
fish consumption in the U.S., according to the Economic Research 
Service (ERS, 2008).  The Siluriformes catfish share is expected 
28
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
                                                 
        
  
to grow in response to increased consumer demand or preference 
for food safety and product innovation. Innovation in 
Siluriformes catfish products is reflected in the rate of new 
products entering the market place, including marinated 
products, breaded products, cooked, dried, or smoked products, 
shelf-stable products, canned and pouched cooked products, and 
refrigerated grocery products.  Siluriformes catfish by-products 
include fish meals, and fertilizers.  Based on FSIS discussions 
with industry experts, about 6 domestic Siluriformes catfish and 
catfish products slaughter and processing firms are vertically 
integrated with ownership of production and slaughter and
processing facilities.
1 
About 7 of the 23 establishments, or 
about 30 percent, are organized as cooperatives.
2 
In addition, based on FSIS discussions with catfish 
industry experts, Table 3 shows that nearly all of the affected 
Siluriformes firms or establishments are considered small 
entities that have 500 or less full-time-equivalent (FTE) 
employees.
For scenario #2 (Ictaluridae Domestic Catfish Supply Chain, 
Table 4), the Ictaluridae definition of catfish, the projection
is the same as in Scenario #1 for the estimated 1,300 commercial 
domestic Ictaluridae catfish producer farms in the United States

that supply live Ictaluridae catfish to about 23 active catfish 
slaughter and processing establishments in the United States 
(USDA NASS, 2009).  Ictaluridae are the North American catfish 
that are raised in the United States. However, in scenario #2, 
the number of wholesalers or brokers, including importers,
affected moves downward from an estimated 80 Siluriformes
wholesalers to about 18 Ictaluridae wholesalers affected because 
the bulk of the imports are Siluriformes that are not of the 
family Ictaluridae. Furthermore, FSIS discussions with industry 
experts indicated that many of the Siluriformes processing-only 
or Siluriformes wholesalers distributor establishments would not 
be affected under the scenario #2 (Ictaluridae definition of 
catfish) because they could continue to utilize the relatively 
lower cost Siluriformes members of the Pangasiidae family -­
basa, tra, swai -- and members of the Clariidae family catfish 
that are commonly farm-raised in overseas locations and exported 
to the United States, at a unit price below domestic 
Siluriformes catfish of the family Ictaluridae.

FDA’s regulation at 21 CFR 123 requires that all seafood 
including Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products be 
processed under HACCP plans.
The baseline information of the Siluriformes catfish and 
catfish products industry supply chain is largely based on 
discussions with the FDA, U.S. National Marine Fisheries
Services (NMFS), U.S. catfish trade organizations, and 
universities.  In addition, FSIS collected baseline information 
by site visits and by discussions with industry and extension 
services experts.
To obtain a full analysis of both costs and benefits, FSIS 
solicits comments on the structure of the domestic and foreign

1. Production and Prices
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS, 2008), domestic 
Ictaluridae farm-raised catfish processed during September 2008 
totaled 39.7 million pounds round weight (live weight), up 1 
percent from September 2007.  The average price paid to 
producers was 82.9 cents per pound for September 2008, up 0.2 
cents from August 2008 and 13.2 cents above September 2007.  Net 
pounds of processed Ictaluridae catfish sold during September 
2008 totaled 17.9 million pounds, down 12 percent from the
comparable month in 2007.  The total end of the month inventory 
increased 8 percent from last month and was up 5 percent from a 
year ago.  Sales of fresh catfish, at 6.51 million pounds, were 
down 13 percent from September 2007 and represented 36 percent 
of total sales.  Frozen catfish sales, at 11.4 million pounds, 
were down 12 percent from September 2007 and accounted for the 
remaining 64 percent of total catfish sales.  Sales of whole 
catfish represented 17 percent of the total catfish sold, 
32
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
    
 
 
 
                                                 
   
   
   
fillets accounted for 61 percent, and the remaining 22 percent 
were mostly steaks, nuggets, and value added products.
The September 2008 average price received by processors for 
domestic total fresh Ictaluridae catfish was $2.60 per pound, up 
23 cents from September 2007.  Prices for fresh whole catfish 
were $1.73 per pound, up 8 cents from September 2007.  Prices 
for domestic fresh Ictaluridae fillets were up 30 cents from 
September 2007 at $3.33 per pound.  Total frozen Ictaluridae 
catfish averaged $2.59 per pound, up 25 cents from September 
2007. September 2008 prices for frozen whole dressed 
Ictaluridae catfish were up 14 cents at $2.26 per pound and
frozen Ictaluridae fillets at $3.07 per pound were up 28 cents 
from September 2007. The 2006-2008 average prices were $0.83 
per pound for frozen whole Ictaluridae catfish,

Ictalurus imports totaled 1.32 million pounds, which were from 
China and Mexico.
In 2007, fresh boneless U.S. Ictaluridae catfish fillet 
exports totaled 62,900 pounds, with 56,100 pounds going to 
Canada and the rest going to Mexico, the Netherlands, and the 
Turks and Caicos Islands.  Frozen, boneless catfish fillets, for 
the month of August 2008, totaled 12,000 pounds all going to the 
Netherlands. Import and export data are compiled by the U.S. 
Census Bureau.
In 2007, about 496.2 million pounds (live weight) of 
Ictaluridae catfish were processed, or packed for the consumer 
as domestically farm-raised catfish, or for use in the 
production of catfish products, down 12 percent from the 566.1 
million pounds processed in 2006.
6 
About 98 percent of domestic 
Ictaluridae farm-raised catfish were used in the production of 
catfish whole fish, fillets and nuggets products.  Most of the 
remaining 2 percent produces organic fertilizer and fish meal 
that is an ingredient for pet foods and other animal foods.  In 
2007, Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products comprised 
2.7 percent of all seafood consumed, in the United States.

In 
2007, the 3.9 percent growth in consumption of Siluriformes 
catfish and catfish food products is attributable to increased

demand by consumers for catfish foods, ample supply of catfish 
and catfish food products, relative low prices to consumers, and 
the recognized safety of Siluriformes catfish and catfish 
products. 
Most of the live domestic Ictaluridae catfish used in 
catfish and catfish food product processing establishments are 
relatively local to the processing establishments. Depending on 
the market prices for farm-raised catfish at the retail outlet 
level, catfish destined for the catfish and catfish product 
market can be graded and packed for catfish and catfish products 
export markets.  
About 23 (and possibly more, especially seasonally in the 
summer months) establishments slaughtered and processed 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish products in 2008, based on 
discussions with catfish trade associations and university 
extension service experts.  About 20 establishments produced 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products for the entire 
year. A total of 23 establishments had some Ictaluridae catfish
slaughtering and catfish processing activities during 2008.  Of 
the 23 establishments processing catfish and catfish food 
products, more than half the establishments added chemicals or 
ingredients, such as sodium tri-polyphosphate or breading
materials, to one or more of their products.  Most domestic

Ictaluridae establishments produced fresh and frozen catfish and 
catfish food products. 
Domestic fresh Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food 
products accounted for about 83 percent of all Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish food products marketed as finished product 
in 2007.  Frozen Ictaluridae catfish and catfish products 
accounted for about 12 percent.  Dried/smoked/cooked Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish products accounted for about 5 percent.

These products are produced in domestic Ictaluridae slaughtering 
and processing establishments that are shown in Table 5, for 
2007.

poultry industry which employs over 500,000 FTE persons in about 
3,000 livestock slaughter and meat products primary processing 
establishments according to Dun and Bradstreet (2008).  Of the 
23 Ictaluridae establishments, 4 are large establishments that 
employ more than 500 FTE persons.
Domestic and foreign Siluriformes catfish and catfish 
products are used in the food service industries, institutional 
food settings, and restaurant trade.  Most of the domestic 
Ictaluridae slaughtering and processing establishments produce 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish products that are directly sold 
to domestic and foreign distributors and retailers. Several of 
the domestic Ictaluridae slaughtering and processing 
establishments import Siluriformes (Ictaluridae and non-
Ictaluridae) catfish food products that are directly sold to 
domestic distributors and retailers.
FSIS asks for information on the number and location of 
processing-only (secondary processors) establishments that 
further process Siluriformes (Ictaluridae and non- Ictaluridae) 
catfish and catfish food products to produce value-added catfish 
10 For the purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, firms that produce 
catfish or catfish products are classified as small if they employ 500 or 
fewer FTE employees, the standard established by the Small Business 
Administration for these types of firms. Based on 2008 discussions with 
individuals of the catfish trade organizations, 4 establishments employed 
more than 500 FTE employees.

and catfish food products for wholesale markets of domestic 
intrastate and interstate commerce, and exports.
Siluriformes (Ictaluridae and non-Ictaluridae) catfish and 
catfish food products include whole catfish, fillets, nuggets, 
steaks, and various products with or without non-catfish 
ingredients that are processed, breaded, and cooked into ready-
to-eat (RTE) food products.  Siluriformes catfish and catfish 
food products may be available in fresh/chilled, frozen, smoked, 
cooked, marinated, breaded, and dried forms.  The volume and 
variety of Siluriformes catfish and catfish products and other 
finfish products have increased at the retail level in recent 
years (ERS, 2008).
In 2007, fresh/chilled Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food 
products accounted for less than half, or about 90.7 million 
pounds, of all, or about 252.4 million pounds, of Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish food products marketed in the U.S. as 
finished product in 2007 (NASS, 2008).  Frozen Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish food products accounted for more than half, 
or about 161.7 million pounds, of the Ictaluridae sales.  
Marinated Ictaluridae catfish food products accounted for a 
small percent of Ictaluridae sales.  Smoked, dried or other

Ictaluridae catfish food products accounted for an even smaller
percent of Ictaluridae sales (NASS, 2008).
11 
According to discussions with the domestic Ictaluridae 
catfish industry representatives, the industry produced a total 
of about 496.2 million pounds (live weight) of domestic 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products in 2007.  About 5
slaughter and processing establishments produce less than 50 
million pounds of Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products 
annually, with an average of 22.0 million pounds of Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish food products.  About 18 slaughtering and 
processing establishments produce 50 million pounds or more, 
with an average output of 97.6 million pounds of Ictaluridae 
food products per year.  These 18 establishments produced 71.3 
percent of all domestic Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food 
products, in 2007.  
2. Catfish and Catfish Food Products Production per Capita,
in the U.S. – Siluriformes
According to the Economic Research Service (ERS, 2008), 
about 0.8 of one pound of Siluriformes (Ictaluridae and non-
Ictaluridae) catfish and catfish food products are produced

that average catfish weighs about 5 pounds. The year 1997 was the last in 
which these production data were collected. Source: Agricultural Statistics

domestically and overseas annually for the general public, per 
capita. However, FSIS discussions with the domestic Ictaluridae 
catfish industry indicated that people that live in the southern 
United States eat more Siluriformes catfish and catfish food 
products per capita than those who reside in the northern and 
western areas.  The U.S. consumer has numerous choices of 
finfish (e.g., tilapia, salmon, and others) that are substitutes 
for Siluriformes catfish and catfish food product.  These 
seafood substitutes are widely available at retail markets. The 
consumption of Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products is
about 7 percent of the total finfish market annually, in the 
U.S. (ERS, 2009).
3. Processing, Cooking, and Inspection
Domestic Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products are 
processed by a mix of automated equipment and hand work that: 
moves the live catfish from receiving; hand sorts out non-
catfish; washes the catfish; de-heads the catfish; sorts by 
sizes; performs evisceration, separation/fabrication of fillets 
and pieces/nuggets (non-fillets) from the shell (i.e., skeletal 
bones) of the catfish, and skin removal; hand trims fillets and 
nuggets to remove tags of skin and bones; conducts chilling by 
water bath; packages; and blast freezes (Silva, 2001).  Fresh
catfish and catfish products are chilled to a temperature not to 
exceed 45ºF prior to additional processing. 
41
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The FDA regulations require that all Siluriformes catfish 
and catfish food products processed and distributed for 
consumption be chilled or frozen, or be shelf stable (cooked, 
smoked or dried) (FDA, 1994).  In addition, processing areas
need to be at 45 degrees or less (FDA, 1994).
Because of the diversity of the domestic Ictaluridae 
catfish and catfish food products industry, there are numerous 
"systems" by which Ictaluridae catfish production and 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products processing are 
linked. Much of the Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food 
products industry has moved to the use of processing systems 
that minimize the period of time (and physiological stress in 
the catfish) between live catch and processing to control 
pathogen growth and ensure catfish quality. The domestic 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish products industry uses some "in­
line" facilities meaning systems in which all catfish presented 
for processing arrive directly from the growing-out ponds that 
are mostly co-located with the catfish and catfish food products 
processing establishment.  FSIS discussions with Industry 
experts, however, have indicated that relatively few (estimated 
at 3-5) establishments slaughter and process catfish at in-line 
facilities. 
A second type of domestic processing system is 
characterized by Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food product 
42
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
slaughtering and processing establishments that are located in 
close proximity to a number of growing-out ponds, thereby 
minimizing the time the catfish are in transit.  The grow-out 
ponds may be owned by the catfish products slaughtering and 
processing establishment.  The slaughtering and processing 
establishments may be legally organized as a producer 
cooperative.  The catfish slaughtering and catfish product 
processing establishment may also purchase catfish from a 
limited number of nearby suppliers under contract.  FSIS
discussions with Industry experts indicated that most of the 
catfish slaughtering and catfish product processing 
establishments are supplied by this system. 
Under a third system, domestic Ictaluridae catfish 
slaughtering and catfish and catfish food product processing 
establishments purchase market-sized Ictaluridae catfish from a 
number of different sources, market intermediaries, or catfish 
and catfish products imports.  The Ictaluridae catfish may vary 
greatly in age and other factors indicative of quality or 
stressed catfish (e.g., flavor, color and texture of flesh, or 
chemical residues).  FSIS discussions with industry experts
indicate that there are relatively few (estimated at 2) domestic 
establishments that slaughter and process Ictaluridae catfish 
and catfish food products using this system. 
43
 
 
 
 
 
       
      
 
  
 
  
   
  
 
      
      
 
 
   
 
Regardless of the system, seasonal factors influence 
Siluriformes supply and demand conditions during the year.  The 
U.S. summer grilling season has highest consumer demand for 
Siluriformes catfish fillets and steaks.  Catfish and catfish 
food product processing establishments often modify their 
acquisition and marketing practices accordingly. 
4. Microbiological, Chemical, and Other Testing
In the 18 high-volume domestic Ictaluridae catfish 
slaughter and processing establishments, the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) tests 
catfish and catfish products for microbiological contaminants 
and chemical adulterants. In addition, establishments test, for 
off-flavors caused by algae, samples of catfish from production 
ponds before harvesting a production lot of catfish.
5. Inspection
FDA inspection program personnel conduct pre-operational 
sanitation inspections and monitor sanitary conditions of the 
establishment premises, facilities, and equipment during 
operations at every catfish and catfish product processing 
establishment, once or twice a year. However, NOAA/NMFS 
inspection program personnel conduct pre-operational sanitation 
inspections and monitor sanitary conditions of the processing 
establishment premises, facilities, and equipment continually 
44
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
       
      
    
  
 
    
during operations at about 18 of 23 catfish and catfish food 
product establishments, daily.  FDA and NOAA/NMFS inspection 
program personnel are responsible for observing the cleanliness, 
type, and wholesomeness of raw materials and finished products, 
the handling of ingredients, packaging, labeling, freezing, 
storing, and all other operations related to the processing and 
production of catfish and catfish products.  In those 
establishments that contract for NOAA/NMFS services, inspection 
program personnel are required to be on duty whenever catfish 
and catfish food products are processed; or packaged; and 
catfish and catfish food products are received or shipped
(Silva, 2001). According to FSIS discussions with industry 
experts, about 18 slaughtering and processing establishments 
annually pay the NMFS approximately $1.3 million for inspection 
services and certifications. These establishments provide office 
and locker space for NMFS inspection program personnel.
6. HACCP Plans and Third Party Audits
FSIS discussions with catfish experts of the catfish trade 
organizations found that about 16, or 70 percent, of the 23
slaughtering and processing establishments are subject to, at a 
minimum, an annual review by buyers or representatives of buyers 
for the verification of processes used at the establishment.  
The discussions also indicated that about 10, or 35 percent, of 
those 23 establishments were subject to certification, 
45
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
         
         
  
   
   
                                                 
  
 
verification, and endorsement from an independent, non-
government organization, using a formal, specified and regular 
procedure of audit and review.   
FSIS solicits more information on services and for third-
party auditors by the private sector.
Furthermore, 23, or 100 percent, of the domestic slaughter 
and processing establishments have written HACCP plans, based on 
discussions with experts of the catfish trade organizations and 
universities that have catfish extension programs.  HACCP
programs, as practiced by the catfish and catfish products 
processing industry, address quality control for catfish and 
non-catfish ingredients, proper processing for fresh, frozen,
and dried product, and finished product testing. A large share 
of catfish and catfish product processing establishments with 
HACCP programs or prerequisite programs likely maintain one or 
more logs to verify performance under these programs
12
. 
7. Refrigeration and Cooling in Processing Areas
Refrigeration and cooling in the processing area of the 
establishment significantly affect the conditions under which 
the growth of Salmonella spp. in catfish and catfish products
can occur (Hui, 2001).  FSIS, after discussions with catfish 
experts from trade organizations and universities, estimates

catfish experts.
46
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
      
       
     
   
  
that about 60 percent of catfish and catfish products are 
processed under refrigeration and cooling at a temperature at
45°F or lower, while the remaining (40 percent) products are at
between 45°and 59°F while in slaughtering and processing areas.  
There is no single temperature, but FSIS compliance guidance for 
maintaining sanitation of food-contact surfaces and utensils 
recommends minimum cleaning frequencies that increase with 
higher temperatures, with the cleaning frequencies increasing 
markedly with temperatures above 50 F to 55 F (See Sanitation 
Performance Standards Compliance Guide, 4-602.11 at 
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Frame/FrameRedirect.asp?main=http://www 
.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/SanitationGuide.htm). 
Traditionally, to help control microbial growth, FSIS has 
expected room temperatures where raw product is handled to be 
below 50 F. 
8. Sanitation
In addition to common sanitation practices, FSIS, after 
discussions with catfish industry experts, estimates that about 
80 percent of the processing establishments conduct a mid-shift 
clean-up.  In addition, FSIS projects based on discussions with 
industry experts that more than 80 percent of establishments
conduct sanitation inspections of non-product contact zones once 
47
 
 
 
 
      
        
    
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
    
 
 
  
per day before daily operations begin, before shift operations 
begin, or more than once per shift.  
9. Employee Training
The FSIS discussions with a catfish industry expert 
indicated that some of the establishments have a formal food 
safety course that is provided by professional trainers to newly 
hired employees.  Most of the establishments provide scheduled 
and unscheduled on-the-job food safety training for newly hired 
employees.  Some of the establishments conduct formal refresher 
courses in food safety, largely by establishment personnel.  All 
of the establishments conduct on-the-job food safety training. 
The expert representative, Juan Silva of Mississippi State 
University, also indicated that most of the establishments have 
at least one employee that has completed formal HACCP training 
(3-5 day course), with some having 1-3 employees that have 
completed such a training course.
B.  Human Health Baseline - Catfish Associated Human Illness
Using the foodborne disease outbreaks data from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, FSIS identified 7 reported
catfish-associated outbreaks with a total 66 reported illnesses 
from 1973 to 2007.  A catfish foodborne disease outbreak is 
defined as the occurrence of 2 or more cases of a similar 
illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food of 
catfish. The last recorded catfish-associated outbreak was in 
48
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
2007.  Disease etiology was reported for 3 of the 7 outbreaks 
identified: 1 outbreak was due to Enterotoxigenic E. coli, ETEC 
O169:H41, with 41 cases in 2003; 1 was due to a chemical with 2 
cases in 2000 but lack of further detail information about the 
chemical involved; and one was due to Salmonella Hadar with 10 
cases in 1991.  According to Wyatt et al., (1979) before FDA 
HACCP regulations were in effect, Salmonella spp. were found in 
21% of aquaculture live catfish in 1979 and can be harbored 
within live catfish for 30 days after exposure to high levels 
(Ward, 1989).
An increased probability of illness is associated with 
consumption of a variety of anthropogenic chemicals such as 
pesticides, environmental contaminants, and drugs. Various
chemicals have been detected in domestic and imported catfish
and catfish products; these compounds represent a potential 
hazard to consumers. 
Catfish and catfish products eaten by U.S. consumers are
consumed cooked, often deep fried, and minimizing
microbiological hazards.  However, some catfish steaks or 
fillets eaten by U.S. consumers are consumed after being cooked 
by microwave, broiling, or grilling.  Microwaving, broiling, and 
grilling likely have illness relative risks higher than that of 
deep frying because microwaving, broiling, or grilling may not 
49
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
sufficiently heat all parts of the catfish steak or fillet in 
order to kill all pathogens.
The effect of uncertainty about the baseline level of 
illnesses or illness relative risks and the effect of the HACCP 
plans and Sanitation SOPs on the reduction in illnesses or 
illness relative risks is examined in the FSIS draft risk 
assessment (USDA FSIS, December 2010) and Benefits Analysis
section, below. 
III.  Regulatory Alternatives 
The alternative of no rulemaking is unavailable. The 2008 
Farm Bill requires FSIS to issue regulations for mandatory 
inspection of catfish and catfish products.  Consistent with 
Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4, two alternatives 
were considered: (1) A more intensive approach in which an 
inspector would be stationed in a processing plant throughout an 
operating shift; (2) A less intensive approach in which an 
inspector would visit an establishment each day. Under either 
approach, the inspector would verify Sanitation SOPs and HACCP 
systems following procedures as instructed by FSIS’s automated 
system for assigning inspection procedures and would conduct 
microbiological, food chemistry, drug and other chemical residue 
sampling as directed or as necessary.  Also, under either 
alternative, FSIS would conduct periodic verification of 
controls at producer locations. The more intensive approach 
50
 
 
 
 
  
     
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
would also involve closer examination of incoming fish and 
outgoing product lots for adulteration or potential misbranding.
The regulatory alternatives for the implementation of HACCP and 
related requirements to the catfish and catfish products 
industry follow:
A.  Status Quo
Under the status quo, catfish and catfish product processing 
establishments would continue to be regulated by FDA and comply 
with HACCP-based, food safety management methods to control 
pathogens and prevent product contamination supplemented by the 
voluntary, fee-for-service inspection and certification programs 
administered by the NMFS.  The use of such programs could 
continue to grow among well-managed firms.  The emphasis on the 
use of client-driven food safety requirements and third party 
audits would ensure that the share of establishments with 
verified, effective food safety management practices would
further increase over time.  However, as previously stated, the 
alternative of no rulemaking is unavailable since the 2008 Farm 
Bill requires FSIS to issue regulations for mandatory inspection 
of catfish and catfish products.    
B.  Proposed Alternative Inspection Systems
Strictly in terms of implementing the FMIA with respect to 
catfish and catfish products, FSIS could take a prescriptive, 
command-and-control approach to inspection, as it has in the 
51
 
 
 
 
 
 
past with meat and poultry and currently does with egg products. 
Command-and-control requirements specify, often in great detail, 
how an establishment is to achieve a particular food-safety 
objective. They may involve the use of specific techniques or 
processing parameters; the review and approval of equipment, 
establishment drawings and specifications; and the review and 
approval of particular process control programs. FSIS, however, 
rejected this command-and-control approach in 1996 with the 
adoption of the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical 
Control Points (PR/HACCP) Systems final rule (61 FR 38806; Jul. 
25, 1996). Moreover, command-and-control approaches are 
generally disfavored, and less burdensome, more flexible 
approaches are generally preferred, under Executive Order 12866 
and OMB Circular A-4.
Thus, FSIS is proposing to adopt, as it has for meat and 
poultry, the somewhat less intensive, yet effective, approach to 
inspection that focuses on the verification of an 
establishment’s food safety system, which consists of an 
establishment’s HACCP plan, Sanitation SOPs, and prerequisite 
programs. As mentioned elsewhere in this document, the FSIS 
HACCP requirements for meat and poultry establishments are very 
similar to the FDA HACCP requirements for seafood processors (in 
21 CFR 123).
52
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
FSIS’s inspection approach is similar to that taken by NMFS 
in its voluntary continuous inspection program, discussed above, 
for seafood processing establishments.  Catfish and catfish 
products processing establishments that are already enrolled in 
the NMFS voluntary program could transition with relatively few 
adjustments into the FSIS mandatory inspection program. Those 
that are not in the NMFS program would have to make somewhat 
greater adjustments, in the areas of sanitation programs, prior 
label approval, documentation, and recordkeeping.
As for products that are to be imported into the United 
States, under the FMIA and the regulations that FSIS is 
proposing, to be eligible to ship catfish and catfish products 
to the United States, foreign countries would have to have 
inspection systems for catfish and catfish products that FSIS 
finds to be equivalent to the United States system. Officials 
of those inspection systems would have to certify individual 
processing establishments and ensure that products exported to 
the United States meet FSIS requirements. 
The evaluation of a country's inspection system to 
determine equivalence involves two steps: 
•	 FSIS conducts a document review of an evaluation of the 
country's laws, regulations, and other written 
information. 
53
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
    
  
     
   
 
•	 If FSIS preliminarily determines that the inspection 
system maintains standards equivalent to the requirements 
outlined in 9 CFR 327.2, a technical team would visit the 
country for an on-site review to evaluate the inspection 
system based on the information submitted to FSIS for the 
document review.
If the result of these two steps is a successful 
determination of equivalence, FSIS would begin rulemaking to add 
the country to the list of countries eligible to export meat, 
poultry and egg products to the United States.
IV.  	Cost Analysis
A.  Domestic Industries Compliance Costs
The major additional domestic compliance costs include 
those associated with the development, validation, and 
implementation of mandatory sanitation SOPs and mandatory HACCP 
plans that are different from the existing regulatory framework 
previously discussed (Table 1 and 2). FSIS would limit this 
analysis to the domestic industry only. FSIS is focusing only 
on domestic costs and is asking for information on costs to 
foreign producers. The rule would affect about 23 domestic 
establishments that slaughter and (primary) process catfish and 
catfish food products (NASS, 2009).  In addition, according to 
FSIS discussions with catfish industry and federal (FDA and 
54
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
NMFA) experts that have data on such establishments, the rule 
would affect about 10 domestic food establishments that conduct 
further (secondary) processing, including repackaging of catfish 
and catfish food products.  The compliance cost of several 
sanitation SOPs and HACCP measures rely on the projected mean
time required to perform related operations, such as 
recordkeeping and certification procedures.  The projections are 
based on the practices that are mostly not currently required. 
The projected frequencies, time requirements, and costs are 
based on information provided by FSIS’s discussions with 
industry experts familiar with HACCP and sanitation SOPs systems 
and the domestic catfish and catfish food products industry. 
The hourly wage rates used in the cost analysis are as 
follows: Quality Control (QC) manager--$34.41; Supervisors or QC 
technicians--$25.28; and production workers--$18.00. The 
compensation wage rates used in the analysis are based on those 
reported for employees at meat and poultry processing 
establishments in the PR/HACCP final rule. The rates are 
updated using the Employment Cost Index published by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS, 2010).  The compensation rates include 
33 percent overhead for employee benefits.  
55
 
 
 
  
 
       
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
      
  
  
 
B.  Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures Additional
Domestic Costs
The proposal requires that each establishment have a 
developed and implemented written sanitation standard operating 
procedures (SSOP) plan that is specific to its catfish and 
catfish food products operations.  While establishments are now 
not required to have a SSOP plan, some establishments operate 
under SSOP plans.  FSIS solicits comments on the proportion of 
catfish and catfish food products establishments that already 
have SSOP plans.
1. Plan Development and Initial Implementation: Additional
Costs
It is assumed that a quality control manager develops the 
written plan for SSOPs.  The average time required would be 8 
hours to prepare the first plan for a production process (e.g., 
production of individual quick frozen (IQF) product) and 4 hours 
for the second plan, if needed. FSIS recognizes that the time 
required for plan development would be determined by the number 
of establishment production processes, the types of products 
produced, volume of production, the quality and source of the 
catfish stock, establishment conditions, and other factors.  The 
one-time cost of plan development for the catfish and catfish 
food products industry is projected to be $5,093.  The

a 7 percent discount rate

2. Sanitation SOPs Recordkeeping and Record Storage
Additional Costs
The time requirements for recording are based on the time 
required to conduct two sets of sanitation observations per day, 
one for pre-operational sanitation procedures and one for 
operational sanitation. The observation and recording tasks 
associated with SSOPs recordkeeping are assumed to require an 
average of 15 minutes by a trained production employee.  The 
quality control technician or establishment management 
equivalent reviews records compiled by the production employee. 
This review is projected to average 10 minutes per day.  
13 Unless stated otherwise, all present value and annualized calculations will 
be made using a discount rate of 7 percent over a ten-year period.  
57
 
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
FSIS’s discussions with experts indicated that about half 
of the establishments conduct sanitation inspections of product 
contact zones more than once per shift, and 10 percent conduct 
such inspections once per shift before shift operations begin. 
The other 40 percent of establishments conduct such inspection 
on a basis that is less frequent than that foreseen by the 
proposal.  In addition, the discussions with industry experts
indicate that about 30 percent of establishments conduct 
sanitation inspections on non-product contact zones more than 
once per shift and that 10 percent conduct such inspections once 
per shift before shift operations begin.  The other 60 percent 
of establishments conduct such inspections on a basis that is 
less frequent.  The amount of time such inspections require is 
not known.  However, the level of effort in these activities 
might be indicated by the commitment of personnel resources. 
FSIS assumes for this analysis that about 60 percent of the 
establishments have a food safety manager, and that about 75 
percent have two or more employees that work in a quality 
control department.  Of the establishments with a quality 
control manager, FSIS assumes that about 85 percent of the 
establishments have at least 25 percent of that employee’s time 
devoted to managing food safety activities.  Based on these 
assumptions and expert opinions, FSIS estimates that between 62 
percent and 45 percent of the establishments conduct Sanitation

SOPs recordkeeping in a manner that is consistent with the 
provisions of the proposal.  For the purposes of this analysis, 
a compliance rate of 50 percent is used.  Based on these 
estimates, the projected annual costs to the industry would be 
about $32,100.

3. Sanitation SOPs Ongoing Additional Implementation Costs
Ongoing additional costs of increased cleaning frequency 
are associated with the sanitation SOPs because of relatively 
high room temperatures in the processing areas of some domestic 
processors. There is no single temperature, but FSIS compliance 
guidance for maintaining sanitation of food-contact surfaces and 
utensils recommends minimum cleaning frequencies that increase 
with higher temperatures, with the cleaning frequencies 
increasing markedly with temperatures above 50 F to 55 F (See 
59
 
 
 
 
     
Sanitation Performance Standards Compliance Guide, 4-602.11 at 
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Frame/FrameRedirect.asp?main=http://www 
.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/SanitationGuide.htm). 
Traditionally, to help control microbial growth, FSIS has 
expected room temperatures where raw product is handled to be 
below 50 F.  In some processing areas of affected 
establishments, where there may be somewhat higher ambient 
temperatures, there would be minor additional sanitation 
operating costs of additional cleaning labor and cleaning 
compounds. These processing areas that are cleaned at a higher 
frequency would not necessarily require additional capital 
investment to upgrade refrigeration or cooling equipment.  Also, 
these processing areas would not necessarily require associated 
additional recurring operating costs of electricity and 
maintenance to operate refrigeration or cooling equipment in 
order to lower the processing room temperature.  
Because about 3 domestic establishments are projected to 
operate processing at air temperatures above 50 to 55 degrees 
Fahrenheit (F), these establishments would need additional 
cleaning of food contact surfaces each day.  For this, 
additional labor for equipment cleaning and sanitation is 
projected to take 10 minutes per day billed at $18.00 per hour, 
or $3.00 (($18 / 60) x 10) for 10 minutes. FSIS projected that 
60
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
 
 
       
       
 
 
   
 
 
these establishments would work 260 days per year for an annual 
cost of about $780 ($3.00 per day x 260 days).  Furthermore, 
additional water, and cleaning and sanitizing materials are 
projected to cost $160 per year. Then, for each establishment 
this totals to $940 ($780 + $160) per year. Thus, for 3 
establishments, this totals to $2,820 (3 x $940) per year. In 
addition, in the first year, FSIS projected that each of about 
23 establishments would need to purchase about $130 of 
additional cleaning equipment such as new scrub brushes and 
water hoses.  For all 23 establishments this would total about 
$3,000 (23 x $130). 
FSIS asks for public comment and information on this issue
and would include the additional data in the analysis for the 
final rule.
4. Sanitation SOPs Training Additional Costs
Based on FSIS’s discussion with catfish experts, FSIS 
assumes that about 70 percent of the establishments’ training 
programs are conducted at their establishment. These programs 
are either a formal food safety course conducted by 
establishment personnel or are a scheduled on-the-job food 
safety program, also conducted by establishment personnel.  
However, FSIS assumes that conducting a SSOPs intervention 
program is a new requirement and consequently training would be 
conducted at all establishments.
61
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
      
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
          
             
          
          
         
              
          
 
         
         
              
               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
Training in Sanitation SOPs verification for catfish and 
catfish products processing establishments would likely take two 
hours for both a Quality Control (QC) technician and production 
worker for each shift at the establishment
14
. Training would be 
conducted once every three years, or in the first, fourth, 
seventh, and tenth year of the 10-year period of analysis. 
Training materials are obtained at no cost from the FSIS Center 
for Learning. The training cost per period is $2,511.  When the 
costs of the 4 training periods are annualized over a ten-year 
period, the cost is $1,011.

The annualized average cost is about $37,200. 
C.  Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems
Additional Domestic Costs
The proposal requires that each establishment have a 
developed, validated, and implemented written HACCP plan that is
specific to each process being performed in the catfish and 
catfish food products establishment.  While the establishment is 
already required to have a HACCP plan, this HACCP plan may not 
63
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
be validated on products.  FSIS asks for comments on the 
proportion of catfish and catfish products establishments that 
already have HACCP plans that are validated.  FSIS compliant 
HACCP plans would have the required validation on products.
However, for purposes of this analysis, FSIS assumes that many
catfish and catfish products processing establishments would
need to re-write their existing HACCP plans in order to be 
compliant with FSIS HACCP plans.  Establishments need not 
prepare HACCP plans for processes for which the hazards, CCPs, 
critical limits, corrective actions, monitoring and verification 
procedures, and recordkeeping systems are similar.  However, in 
order to have FSIS-compliant HACCP plans, the establishments may 
need to conduct validation on a product-by-product basis.  
For purposes of this analysis, there would be two processes 
employed in catfish and catfish products production 
(fresh/frozen and breaded products).  Fresh/frozen products 
include 4 primary categories: catfish fillets, whole catfish, 
catfish nuggets, and steak products.  Breaded catfish products 
include three primary categories: breaded catfish fillets, 
breaded catfish nuggets, and breaded catfish steak products.  In 
addition, there could be marinated products, individual quick 
frozen (IQF) products (e.g., fillets, steaks, and nuggets), 
cooked products, and smoked/dried products.  Each HACCP plan 
would include identification of the processing steps that 
64
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
       
 
 
 
 
 
present hazards; identification and description of the CCP for 
each identified hazard; specification of the critical limit that 
may not be exceeded at the CCP (and, if appropriate, a target 
limit); a description of the establishment monitoring 
procedures; a description of the corrective action to be taken 
if a critical limit is exceeded; a description of the records 
that would be generated and maintained regarding this CCP; and a 
description of the facility verification activities and the 
frequency at which they are to be conducted.  Establishments
would also be required to record observations when monitoring 
CCPs and to document any deviations and corrective actions.  
Such records are to be reviewed and certified by an employee not 
involved in recording observations. 
1. HACCP Plan Development, Validation, and Reassessment
Additional Costs
The proposal requires that the establishment review and 
analyze its processes. A HACCP-trained QC technician or other 
suitable personnel could perform the hazard analysis. 
The discussions with industry experts indicate that some 
(assumed to be about 80 percent) catfish and catfish product 
establishments have a written HACCP plan; that a significant 
share of these plans designate slaughter, breading, marinating,
and other processes as CCPs; and that a large share of these 
establishments maintain records to verify a number of HACCP 
65
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
                                                 
 
 
  
activities. Based on discussions with industry experts, FSIS 
assumes that about 75 percent of small establishments and about 
90 percent of large establishments have a written HACCP plan.  
Based on these discussions, there would be 4 one-process 
establishments and 11 two-process establishments that would be 
required to develop a HACCP plan
15
. 
Upon completion of the hazard analysis and development of 
the HACCP plans, establishments are required to determine 
whether the HACCP plan is functioning as intended.  During the 
initial validation period, establishments are to repeatedly test 
the adequacy of the CCPs, critical limits, monitoring and 
recordkeeping procedures, and corrective actions identified in 
the HACCP plan.  Activities conducted by the establishment that 
are associated with validation include the calibration of 
process-monitoring instruments, direct observations of 
monitoring activities and corrective actions, and review of 
records.
16 
The most critical aspect of the HACCP plan validation 
for catfish and catfish product processing establishments would
be to ensure that the chilling process employed at the 
establishment achieves the required level of stopping bacteria 
growth to validate the adequacy of CCP critical limits.
15 The number of one-process and two-process establishments in compliance with 
the HACCP establishment requirement is estimated. The number of affected 
establishments is estimated.

The projected one-time first-year cost of HACCP plan 
development and validation for a single process establishment is 
about $8,000.  For a two-process establishment, the cost is 
projected at about $6,000 per process, or a total of about 
$12,000.

In addition, all 23 processing establishments are 
required to conduct an annual reassessment of their HACCP plan 
which is estimated at about $70 per process in plan.  The total 
one-time first-year costs for plan development are projected to 
be about $98,000.  The annual reassessment thereafter is about 
$1,050 for the industry.

2. HACCP Training Additional Costs
Each catfish and catfish products processing establishment, 
or further processing food establishment is projected to employ 
a quality control (QC) manager and a quality control(QC)
technician to ensure compliance with the proposed measures. At 
a minimum, the quality control (QC) manager would have 
successfully completed a recognized HACCP training course of at 
least 3-5 days with an equivalent amount of time of training in 
the principles of HACCP, the application of these principles, 
and the development of a HACCP plan for catfish and catfish 
products. A QC technician would be responsible for day-to-day 
activities related to the HACCP plan implementation.  
FSIS’s industry discussions with experts indicate that 
HAACP-trained employees are likely found in a large share of 
catfish and catfish product establishments.  Further, FSIS 
estimates that about 54 percent (18 of 33) of the establishments 
employ a food safety manager. Based on FSIS’s discussions with 
catfish experts, FSIS estimates that about 75 percent of catfish 
and catfish product establishments have at least 2 or more 
employees that work in a quality control (QC) department and 
that 85 percent of the establishments have at least 1 employee 
that has completed a formal 3-5 day HACCP training course.  For 
the purposes of this analysis, 35 percent of establishments
would obtain training for a QC manager and QC technician for

each shift where processing operations are conducted.  Of the 16
establishments in need of HACCP training, 12 establishments
operate one shift and 4 operate two shifts.  Training would be 
conducted on the first year of implementation and also the sixth 
year to account for attrition. 
HACCP training course materials, including test materials, 
are available at no cost from the FSIS Center for Learning.  The 
projected time required to complete the course is 40 hours.  The 
course is self taught. The training material is the same as 
that used by FSIS to train its employees.  FSIS assumes that 
this method of instruction would be used rather than hiring a 
consultant to teach the course at the work site or to send 
employees to an off-site location.  Training costs per training 
period is projected at $47,700, with an annualized cost of 
$10,873.

3. HACCP Personnel Additional Cost
Personnel costs are associated with the activities of the 
QC manager who would be responsible for addressing and 
performing functions related to hazard analysis, plan 
development, plan validation, and review and assessment of 
critical limits and responses to deviations.  These activities 
are projected to require 5 percent and 10 percent of the QC 
manager’s time at one and two process facilities, respectively. 
The salary of QC managers is projected at $71,658, based on the 
hourly compensation rates used in the analysis.  The personnel 
costs associated with HACCP implementation are based on the 
expert opinion that about 60 percent of establishments employ a 
food safety manager, which is the equivalent of a quality 
control manager. The broader quality control activities 
associated with HACCP plan validation, review, and related tasks 
may be performed at the corporate level, given the similarity of 
plans and processes at catfish and catfish product 
establishments.  Based on these findings, the number of 
establishments that would not currently comply with the 
projected personnel time requirement related to hazard analysis, 
plan development, plan validation, and review and assessment of 
critical limits and responses to deviations are 5 one-process 
firms and 6 two-process firms. Based on these projections, the

4. HACCP Recordkeeping and Record Storage Additional Costs
The proposal requires facilities to record observations 
when monitoring CCPs and to document any deviations and 
corrective actions.  The rule also requires that such records be 
certified by an employee not involved in recording observations. 
HACCP records include measurements taken during processing, 
deviations from CCPs, corrective actions, verification check 
results, and related information including the identity of the 
product, the product code or production lot, and the date of the 
recording. 
Recordkeeping costs include the time it takes to make 
observations and record the results of those observations, plus 
the cost of certifying and maintaining records.  Total 
71
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
recordkeeping costs are the sum of the costs for three 
components: monitoring CCPs and recording findings, certifying 
records, and storing records.  The monitoring and recording 
costs are described by the formula:
RC = O x CP x T/60 x WR x D where
RC = Monitoring and recording costs,
O = Number of industry operations requiring recordkeeping,
CP = Number of CCP's per HACCP plan,
T = Recording time in minutes per CCP, 
WR = Wage rate for recording and monitoring, and
D = Days of operations during the year, in this case, 260.
The cost of certification is described by the formula:
C = S x CC x TC/60 x WC x D where,
C = Certification costs,
CC = Number of CCP's per plan,
S = Number of shifts,
TC = Time in minutes for certifying each CCP per shift, and
WC = Hourly wage rate for QC technician,
FSIS projects that 18 of the 33 establishments conduct 
recordkeeping and verification in varying degrees. FSIS 
considers the recordkeeping and verification practices at about 
15 establishments to be conducted in a manner that would be 
found at official meat and poultry establishments. These 
establishments constitute 45 percent (15/33) of the industry.

The remaining 55 percent, or 18 establishments, are considered 
not to be in compliance with the recordkeeping and monitoring 
requirements for the purposes of the analysis, even though a 
significant recordkeeping and monitoring may be performed at 
these establishments.

Other variables included the mean number of CCPs per plan 
and the mean amount of time for recording and reviewing records 
per CCP. The number of CCPs per catfish and catfish product 
processing establishment may vary considerably across the 
industry. The major variables affecting the number of CCPs at 
any individual establishment are the number and types of 
products produced, age of the establishment, whether or not the

establishment is an in-line processor, and the quality of the 
catfish stock.  FSIS technical personnel suggest 4 to 6 CCPs per 
HACCP plan. Another expert suggests a minimum of 3 CCPs.
18 
This 
source also states that it is important for processors to know 
the history of the catfish they receive, suggesting additional 
CCPs may be needed. Based on information obtained from industry 
experts and those familiar with catfish and catfish product 
processing, the number of CCPs is projected to be an average of 
5 per establishment per process.  Based on these factors, the 
projected annual cost of HACCP recordkeeping and monitoring is 
estimated to be $53,400.  FSIS seeks comment on the number of 
additional CCPs anticipated, taking into account the variables 
listed above. 
Recordkeeping storage costs were based on a national survey 
of storage costs showing an average annual cost of $8.40 per 
square foot in 1994, which was updated to $9.63 per square foot.  
Annual storage costs for HACCP records were assumed to be $60 
per establishment for a total of $1,080 (18 x $60).    
The total first-year additional cost of the proposed HACCP 
requirements for the catfish and catfish product industry is

The total additional costs of SSOPs and HACCP for the 
catfish and catfish food product processing domestic industry 
are shown in Table 14.  The first year and annual costs of these 
measures are $310,400 and $184,500, respectively. 
D.  Pre-harvest – Production and Transportation Additional
Domestic Costs
Under this proposal, FSIS would take account of the
conditions under which the catfish are raised and transported to 
the processing establishment. Catfish for human food must have 
75
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
grown and lived under conditions that would not render them 
unsound, unwholesome, unhealthy, or otherwise unfit for human 
food. 
The majority of the real and perceived concerns with the 
safety and quality of raw aquaculture products originate at the 
farm level.  These concerns include pathogen contamination (e.g. 
Salmonella), chemical contamination, and misused or unapproved 
chemotherapeutic drugs. 
Under scenario #1 of the proposal, FSIS assumes that 
catfish producers and haulers of live catfish to processing 
establishments would need to be included in SSOPs and HACCP 
plans of the receiving processing establishments. Furthermore, 
producers and haulers would likely need to put in place Good 
Aquaculture Practices (GAqPs) or Good Manufacturing Practices 
(GMPs).
In addition, FSIS projects that catfish producers would
have additional laboratory testing costs to monitor pond water 
and sediment for suspended solids, organic matter, nutrients, 
heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and industrial chemicals. 
FSIS would sample feed, fish, and pond water and sediment.
FSIS solicits information on the costs to the catfish 
producers because of the proposal.
In addition, FSIS assumes that about 50 percent, or 11 of 
the 23 catfish and catfish products processors, contract with 
76
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
about 11 loading-and-hauling firms.  These 11 firms capture and 
load the live catfish into their approximately 66 water-tanker 
trucks (using approximately 6 trucks per establishment), and 
then transport alive the catfish to the processing 
establishments. The approximately 11 firms that run their 66 
water-tankard trucks would likely need to upgrade about 50 
percent of the 66 trucks, or an upgrade of about 33 trucks.  The 
remaining 12 processing establishments run their own catching 
crews and hauling using approximately 5 trucks per establishment 
or a total of about 60 water-tankard trucks.  After 
implementation of the final rule, FSIS assumes that 50 percent 
of these 11 contracted firms or approximately 5 firms would be 
affected because of additional HACCP plans, SSOPs, and Pre­
requisite Program requirements for the transportation of the 
live catfish to the processing establishments.  
For transportation of live catfish to the processing 
establishment, the proposal requires sufficient water and oxygen 
to ensure catfish are not adulterated. FSIS projects that 
haulers would have a one-time cost of approximately $1,800 per 
truck to purchase and install equipment on each of their 63 (30
+ 33) trucks that would provide sufficient oxygen to ensure that 
catfish are not adulterated when they arrive at the slaughter 
and processing establishments.  Many of these trucks already 
77
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
    
   
 
have and use this equipment. FSIS assumes that about 126 trucks 
are used to haul catfish to the processing establishments.  
FSIS projects that the one-time cost would be approximately 
$56,700 (63 x 900) for the additional equipment.  Furthermore, 
FSIS projects that the operating cost annually for the oxygen 
injection and maintenance is 20 percent of the $900 cost of the 
equipment, or $180 per year per truck. If there are about 126 
trucks, the projected annual cost would be $22,680 (126 x 180).
FSIS solicits information on the number of firms and trucks 
that would be affected by the proposed rule, and the compliance 
cost to trucker firms or processing firms.
E.  Microbiological, Chemical, and Other Testing Additional
Domestic Costs
The proposed rule requires additional microbiological, 
chemical, and other testing. In addition, FSIS projects that 
catfish producers would have additional laboratory testing costs 
to monitor pond water and sediment for suspended solids, organic 
matter, nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and 
industrial chemicals. FSIS would sample feed, fish, and pond 
water and sediment.
FSIS solicits information on the testing frequency and 
costs to the catfish and catfish processors and catfish 
producers because of the proposal. Then, FSIS would include 
these costs in the cost analysis with the final rule.
78
 
 
 
    
  
 
  
 
 
     
  
 
  
F.  New Labels: Additional Domestic Costs
The proposed rule requires new label statements for all 
catfish and catfish products.  Additionally, statements must be 
printed on the principal display panel of the product. To 
determine the cost of this proposed regulation on the industry, 
a labeling cost model developed by researchers at RTI was used 
to project costs (Muth, 2001).  This model was originally 
developed for various consumer food products and was adapted for 
catfish and catfish products.  The one-time cost is for the 
manufacturing of the flexographic printing plates with the 
required information of the official inspection legend, place of 
manufacture, 100-percent net weight, safe-handling labeling for 
products that are not ready-to-eat.  These plates are assumed to 
have a useful life of at least 10 years. The printing of new 
catfish and catfish product labels is an additional cost because 
of this proposed rule.
For the scenario #1, based on the RTI analysis, FSIS 
projected that the one-time cost of the new labeling requirement 
for the processors is about $121,000, and annual recurring cost 
is about $18,000. For scenario #2, FSIS projected that the one­
time cost of the new labeling requirement for the processors is 
about $102,000, and annual recurring cost is about $11,000. The 
lower label cost for scenario #2 is due to the lower volume of 
79
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
        
 
 
           
             
            
            
            
  
 
 
 
 
     
 
  
 
 
  
  
labeled products.  Some of the importers repackage product and 
would need to add additional labels.

G.  Provision of Government Office Space and Equipment
Additional Costs
The proposal requires provision of Government office space 
and some equipment in each of the approximately 23 catfish and 
catfish products processing establishments, and in each of the 
approximately 10 catfish and catfish products further processing 
(processing-only) establishments. FSIS assumes that it would 
occupy the existing 18 NMFS offices of the 23 establishments 
that slaughter and process catfish and catfish products. 
However, FSIS would need new remodeled office space in about 15 
establishments – about 5 establishments that slaughter and 
process catfish and catfish products, and about 10 that further 
process catfish and catfish products. FSIS assumes that it 
80
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
would need at a minimum 150 (10 x 15) square feet of securable
office space with at least one desk with a drawer that can be 
locked, a chair, and a locker to hang clothes. In addition, the 
Government office needs to have a telephone and telephone 
connection, and 110-120 volt 20 ampere electrical outlet.  
Furthermore, the office needs ventilation, heating, cooling, and 
lighting that meets OSHA standards for office space.  Based on 
discussion with experts that construct office space, FSIS 
projects that this space would cost about $6 per square foot to 
remodel existing space, or $900 (6 x 150) per office.  
Furthermore, FSIS projects that it would cost about $200 to 
furnish the remodeled office space with a desk/table, chair, 
locker cabinet, and telephone. FSIS projects that the total 
one-time cost at $1,100 (900 + 200) per Government office that 
would be for exclusive use by FSIS. FSIS projects that the one­
time cost to the approximately 15 establishments for additional 
Government offices would be about $16,500 (15 x 1,100).  FSIS 
projects that the recurring costs would be about $40 per month 
for telephone service, electricity, heating, cooling, and other, 
or $480 (12 x 40) per year per office.  FSIS projects that the 
recurring annual cost to the approximately 15 establishments for 
the additional Government offices would be about $7,200 (15 x 
480).

H.  Re-inspection at Import Establishments Additional Cost
For the purposes of this analysis, FSIS assumes that the 
flow of imported catfish would not change as a result of this 
rulemaking. Specifically, we assume that countries which
currently export catfish to the U.S. processors would be able to 
obtain equivalency from USDA by the end of the proposed phase-in 
period. Thus, U.S. processors who rely on imported catfish 
would not face a shortage of catfish to process and would not
need to switch products they process. FSIS recognizes that this 
assumption may not be realistic. If countries that currently 
export catfish to the U.S. processors are not able to obtain 
equivalency before the implementation date, U.S. processors who 
rely on imported catfish may face a shortage of fish to process 
or would need to switch products they process leading to higher 
costs and lower profits. If so, additional costs would be 
incurred and those costs would have to be considered in a full 
analysis. Comments are requested on these issues.
The proposal requires import inspection establishments to 
provide facilities space for the re-inspection of catfish and 
catfish food products that meet the same sanitation requirements 
for the re-inspection of meat and poultry products.  This 
provision could apply to about 80 import establishments for 
scenario #1.  For scenario #2, this provision could apply to 
about 18 importers who import Ictaluridae. To carry out this 
82
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
task, FSIS randomly selects samples of imported catfish and 
catfish products and conducts various tasks including product 
examinations, net weight compliance checks, condition of the 
container, incubation of shelf-stable products, special 
examinations, and laboratory analyses. 
The proposal does not result in any changes to the 
maintenance, operation, or physical requirements of inspection 
houses where re-inspection activities are conducted.  FSIS
experts conclude that all import establishments conducting meat 
and poultry re-inspection activities could apply and be granted 
authority to conduct catfish and catfish product re-inspection
activities. Establishments would have to add a SSOPs plan to 
current written plans, but the costs of doing so are minimal.  
For scenario #1, FSIS projects that the recurring cost for about 
80 importers after the first year is about $600 each year, after 
a first year cost of about $1,800. For scenario #2, FSIS 
projects that the recurring cost for about 18 importers after 
the first year is about $400 each year, after a first year cost 
of about $500.
FSIS solicits information on the costs to the import 
establishments because of the proposal.
I.  Additional Agency Costs
There are a number of tasks that FSIS must undertake prior 
to and during the implementation of sanitation SOPs and HACCP 
83
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
  
 
  
 
plans in the catfish and catfish product processing, further 
processing, and production supply chain industries.  Costs 
currently incurred by FDA and NMFS would be incurred by FSIS, if 
the proposal is finalized.  In addition, NMFS would not generate 
revenues by providing voluntary inspection services to catfish 
processors. be transferable to FSIS, and likely these revenues
would no longer be available to NMFS.  FSIS in this analysis 
uses a net agency cost, after considering projected net cost 
savings of FDA and NMFS because they would be displaced by FSIS 
inspection services that would be free to the industry, except 
for overtime and other fees such as for export certificates.
1. Training and Personnel Additional Costs
The SSOP, HACCP, and RTE training has not been targeted for 
catfish and catfish product inspectors. New training would need 
to be developed based on the rule, and the inspection policies 
to verify implementation of the rule would be outlined in a 
directive. All catfish and catfish product inspectors would 
need the training.
The long-term objective of FSIS is to establish an 
inspection system where inspection program personnel would be 
equally qualified to conduct inspection activities at meat or 
poultry establishments, or maybe catfish and catfish product 
processing establishments.  To accomplish this objective, 
inspection program personnel would be cross-trained in meat, 
84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
poultry, and catfish and catfish product HACCP procedures and 
inspection tasks. 
Training for FSIS inspection program personnel is based on 
the following assumptions. Inspection program personnel 
assigned to catfish and catfish product processing 
establishments, catfish and catfish products further processing 
food establishments, and catfish production establishments could 
require one week of training on SSOPs and one week of training 
on HACCP.  They could complete training on the Performance Based 
Inspection System (PBIS) through computer-based training.  They 
could then complete the Other Consumer Inspection training by 
computer-based training, completing the modules that are 
applicable to the procedures that need to be performed in the 
establishments in their assignment.  As appropriate, inspection 
program personnel currently assigned to meat and poultry 
establishments could complete one week of training on catfish 
and catfish product processing.  The total costs (including 
travel, lodging, per diem, and training program) for a one-week 
training program is $1,125. For scenario #1, FSIS anticipates 
that it could train 109 catfish and catfish product inspection 
program personnel for three weeks each, for a total of 327 
training weeks at a one-time cost of $367,900 (109 x 3 x 
$1,125). The total number of training weeks provided to FSIS 
inspection program personnel is 377. Based on these 
85
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
assumptions, the cost of training FSIS inspection program 
personnel is expected to be $424,125 (377 x $1,125). For 
scenario #2 with fewer importers and a smaller volume of 
products to inspect, fewer FSIS inspection program personnel and 
fewer training weeks would be needed.  In this case, the 
training cost could be for about 10 percent fewer or about 340 
training weeks for FSIS inspection program personnel for about 
$382,500.  For both scenarios #1 and #2, replacement inspectors 
could be required during periods when inspectors at catfish and 
catfish product establishments are being trained.  The cost of 
replacement inspectors is projected at about $1,279 per week 
based on discussions with an FSIS district office. 
Consequently, for scenario #1, the projected one-time cost of 
replacement inspectors is about $418,200 (327 x $1,279).  For 
scenario #2, the projected one-time cost of replacement 
inspectors is about $371,000 (290 x $1,279).  The projected 
total one-time cost of training inspectors at catfish and 
catfish product establishments and further processing food 
establishments is $842,400, for scenario #1. For scenario #2, 
FSIS projects about 10 percent less cost, or about $760,000.
The annual salaries for each inspector are $54,900 for a 
recurring cost of $329,400, for scenario #1, and $329,400, for 
scenario 2.  One-time re-location costs are projected at $7,500 
per employee for a total of $45,000. The training costs could 
86
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
be the same as those identified above for a projected total of 
$20,250. The projected total one-time costs to FSIS for 
training related costs are $907,600, for scenario #1, and 
$818,000 for scenario #2.  For scenario #1, FSIS projects that 
its testing and other costs (e.g., packing and shipping samples, 
analyzing these samples, recording results in the Agency’s 
databases, and reporting results to the industry and the public) 
are about $12,018,900 per year (see Table 16). For scenario #2, 
FSIS projects that it’s testing and other costs would be about 
$9,000,000 per year because of a smaller volume of product yet 
testing for species identification would increase for this 
scenario.

2. Develop Generic HACCP Models and Sanitation SOPs Models
– Additional Costs
FSIS plans to assist catfish and catfish food product 
primary processing establishments, and food establishments that 
further (secondary) process catfish and catfish food products 
with HACCP and sanitation SOPs implementation.  A generic model, 
containing different process category examples for catfish and 
catfish food products, could be developed to assist catfish and 
catfish product establishments and catfish production 
88
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
 
  
 
establishments in the preparation of their HACCP plans.  The 
model is illustrative and could serve to minimize many obstacles 
to preparing a HACCP plan.  As was the case with meat and 
poultry HACCP implementation, FSIS could also invite members of 
the private sector to participate in ongoing small establishment
demonstration projects following promulgation of a final rule to 
show how HACCP systems can work under actual operating 
conditions.  Based on FSIS’s experience with assisting small 
meat and poultry establishments, the cost of FSIS activities to 
assist catfish and catfish product processing establishments, 
and further processing establishments with HACCP and Sanitation 
SOPs implementation is $125,000.
3. Re-inspection – Additional Costs
The proposal requires import inspection establishments to 
provide facilities for the re-inspection of catfish and catfish 
products that meet the same sanitation requirements for the re-
inspection of meat and poultry products. This provision could 
apply to about 80 establishments.  To carry out this task, FSIS 
randomly selects samples of imported meat and poultry products 
and conducts various tasks including product examinations, net 
weight compliance checks, condition of the container, incubation 
of shelf-stable products, special examinations, and laboratory 
analyses. 
89
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
       
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
The proposal does not result in any changes to the 
maintenance, operation, or physical requirements of inspection 
houses where re-inspection activities are conducted.  FSIS
experts conclude that all import establishments conducting meat 
and poultry re-inspection activities could apply and be granted 
authority to conduct catfish and catfish product re-inspection 
activities. Some training may be required for FSIS inspection 
program personnel located at these facilities.  These training 
needs could be addressed through current FSIS employee training 
programs. 
4. Microbiological, Chemical, and Other Testing –
Additional Costs
FSIS would conduct or purchase services to run 
microbiological, chemical, and other tests. FSIS would sample 
and test feed, fish, and pond water and sediment, for microbes, 
chemicals, and species determinations. FSIS projects that it 
would cost about $12,000,000 per year to collect, ship, and
analyze these samples; recording results in the Agency’s 
databases; and reporting results to the industry and the 
public).  Under the proposed scenario #2, the Ictaluridae
definition of catfish, FSIS would need to do relatively more 
test samples for speciation compared to scenario #1.

5. Total FSIS Additional Implementation and Annual Costs
For scenario #1, the projected total cost of FSIS 
additional implementation one-time first-year is $1,032,000, and 
annual cost of $15,302,000 per year, after the first year, are 
shown in Table 17.  For scenario #2, the projected total cost of 
FSIS additional implementation one-time first-year is $944,000, 
and annual cost of $11,625,000 per year, after the first year, 
are shown below.  Scenario #2 requires less FSIS resources 
because it has about 62 fewer importers and less volume of 
imported products to inspect than scenario #1.

supply chain industries of the proposed measures is projected at 
about $306,000.  The first year cost is projected at about 
$543,000. For the catfish and catfish food product domestic 
industry, the additional mean annual cost is projected at 
$187,000.  The projected additional mean estimated annualized 
cost is $240,000 (See Table 18).  The projected lower bound (10
th 
percentile) is $237,000, and the projected upper bound (90
th 
percentile) is $243,000.
19 
The present value of the mean cost, 
using a 7 percent discount rate over 10 years is projected at 
$1.7 million (Table 18). 
For scenario #2, the additional mean total first-year and 
one-time cost to the catfish and catfish food products domestic 
supply chain industries of the proposed measures is projected at 
about $286,000.  The first year cost is projected at about 
$516,000. For the catfish and catfish food product domestic 
industry, the additional mean annual cost is projected at 
$181,000.  The projected additional mean estimated annualized 
cost is $230,000 (See Table 18).  The projected lower bound (10
th 
percentile) is $227,000, and the projected upper bound (90
th

using a 7 percent discount rate over 10 years is projected at 
$1.6 million (Table 18). The results of the uncertainty analysis 
of the costs are in the economic model in Exhibit A below.
For scenario #1, the projected additional mean total 
annualized cost to the catfish and catfish food products supply 
chain industries of the provisions of the proposal analyzed is 
about $0.0008 per pound ($240,000 / 285 million pounds, in 2007) 
of aggregate processed catfish and catfish food products.
For scenario #2, the projected additional mean total 
annualized cost to the catfish and catfish food products supply 
chain industries of the provisions of the proposal analyzed is 
about $0.0011 per pound ($230,000 / 204 million pounds, in 2007) 
of aggregate processed catfish and catfish food products.
The cost of the provisions to the catfish and catfish food 
products industry compares to a 2006-2008 average price of $0.83
per pound for frozen whole catfish,
21 
$1.14 per pound for frozen 
catfish fillets,
22 
and $0.402 per pound for frozen catfish
nuggets. 
23 
These costs compare to an estimated cost of about 1 
cent per pound of meat and poultry associated with the Pathogen 
for each of the alternatives for the proposed rule. The stochastic model 

uses @RISK (Version 4.5, Palisades Corp.) to examine the effects of 

uncertainty.

For scenario #1, for the domestic industry and the 
government, the additional mean total first-year one-time cost 
to the catfish and catfish products supply chain industries and 
additional cost to the government of the proposed measures is 
projected at $1.3 million.  The additional mean total first-year

V. Potential Benefits
If the series of regulatory changes proposed by FSIS 
improves the implementation of sanitation and HACCP plans, they 
could reduce the prevalence and levels of microbial pathogens 
and other contaminants in catfish and catfish products by 
reducing pathogen numbers and other contaminants at critical 
points during processing and by denying the opportunity for 
growth of those pathogens that are present.  SSOPs and HACCP 
systems ensure process control through selected critical control 
points.  The HACCP plan requires that the establishment manager, 
quality control manager, and others establish CCPs for every 
hazard identified in the hazard analysis and critical limits at 
each CCP; establish a plan to monitor those CCPs; determine how 
deviations from critical limits would be handled; and establish 
procedures for validating that the plan is being followed and 
that it is properly controlling the identified hazards.
The analysis of benefits anticipates that catfish and 
catfish products establishments would be in compliance with the 
requirements for Sanitation SOPs and HACCP according to the 
implementation schedule. Based on discussions with industry 
experts, FSIS believes that a significant share of the catfish 
and catfish products industry is already compliant with many of 
the individual proposed measures. Even though compliance rates 
for some HACCP related activities may be relatively high, the 
97
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
performance of HACCP systems depends on how well all the 
elements are being performed. 
The proposed SSOPs and HACCP mitigations are not 
specifically incorporated into the analysis, and therefore, 
their benefits cannot be quantified.  Additional human health 
benefits are expected from the implementation of SSOPs and HACCP 
plans, as catfish and catfish products processing establishments
improve refrigeration or cooling in processing areas, 
sanitation, processing, and packaging practices.
To illustrate potential benefits, FSIS has assessed the 
annual numbers of new Salmonella spp. illnesses that would need 
to be reduced for societal benefits to equal additional costs. 
This can be written as:
Reduction in new human Illnesses per year = Annualized additional cost 
of proposed rule/Cost per new human illness 
The analysis of benefits anticipates that catfish and 
catfish product processing establishments would be in compliance 
with the requirements for HACCP Plan and Sanitation SOPs 
according to the implementation schedule. FSIS believes that a 
significant share of the domestic catfish and catfish products
industry HACCP plans is already compliant with many of the 
proposed measures. 
98
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
We chose Salmonella spp. to illustrate the potential 
benefits because the updated draft catfish risk assessment 
prepared by FSIS -- “Draft Risk Assessment of the Potential 
Human Health Effect of Applying Continuous Inspection to 
Catfish” (USDA FSIS, December 2010) -- identified Salmonella as 
a potential concern in catfish.  However, the number of human 
illnesses associated with catfish and catfish products is 
relatively small compared to that associated with meat and 
poultry products.  
Published literature reports that Salmonella spp. testing 
results show that a share of raw catfish and raw catfish food 
products tested positive for Salmonella spp. Table 19 shows the 
percentages of samples that tested positive for Salmonella spp. 
for catfish fillets, for 1979-2009.  The percentage of positive 
samples during this period for fillets ranged from 2.3 to 48.6 
percent. However, we note that some of these estimates are 
based on samples taken prior to full implementation of FDA’s 
seafood HACCP regulations of 1994.

A. Consequences of Illnesses
Following the Economic Research Service (ERS, 2009), FSIS 
assumes 3 illness severity levels of salmonellosis. They are 
classified as: mild, does not visit a physician and lasts 1-3 
days; moderate, visits a physician and lasts 2-12 days; or 
severe, which results in hospitalization and recovery and may 
last from 11-21 days.  The CDC estimates that 8.1 percent of the 
Salmonella spp. cases in 1997 could have resulted in physician 
visits, and that 1.2 percent of Salmonella spp. cases led to 
100
 
 
 
   
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
     
  
 
   
  
 
    
      
 
 
hospitalizations. Thus it is reasonable to conclude that the 
remaining 90.7 percent of gastrointestinal cases are mild and do 
not require a visit to a physician.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that salmonellosis leads 
to both acute and chronic illnesses. The acute illness that 
accompanies salmonellosis generally causes gastrointestinal 
symptoms that can lead to lost productivity and medical 
expenses. Salmonellosis may result in acute or chronic 
arthritis. Arthritis is characterized by limited mobility, pain 
and suffering, productivity losses, and medical expenditures. 
Finally, salmonellosis can result in death, especially in the 
elderly, children, and people with compromised immune systems.  
FSIS projected the costs for each of the severity levels shown 
in Table 20.
The benefits from this proposed regulation are presented 
both in monetary and non-monetary terms.  One way to measure the 
effects of foodborne illness is to use Quality Adjusted Life 
101
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
   
 
   
 
       
 
 
                                                 
   
Years (QALYs) or Quality Adjusted Life Days (QALDs). This 
method involves using a weighting system for determining how 
much less the utility of illness or death is to society or to 
the individual than the utility of good health. 
This analysis uses the ERS estimates for medical costs 
associated with salmonellosis (updated to 2004 dollars)
24 
(ERS, 
2009) and the FDA weights for QALDs.  The medical costs 
associated with arthritis are from Zorn & Klontz (1998).  
Applying the same methodology as FDA in projecting a monetary 
value for each QALD, using the value of a statistical life 
(VSL); and the value of a statistical life year (VSLY), FSIS
projects a mean annualized cost of about $18,000 per new average 
case of salmonellosis (FDA, 2009).
B. Potential Magnitude of Catfish-Related Illnesses
As previously noted, CDC data shows that one outbreak was 
directly attributed to Salmonella Hadar with 10 cases in 1991. 
However, due to under reporting of illness and the difficulty in 
attributing illness to a particular vehicle, the actual number 
of illnesses associated with catfish may be larger.
FSIS conducted an illustrative assessment of the potential 
risk to human health of catfish consumption, using the example 
of Salmonella contamination. Table 21 shows the projected 
number of new human illnesses annually for the baseline 
FSIS uses the Medical Care Services CPI inflator to express figures in 2004 dollars.

scenarios #1 (catfish order Siluriformes) and #2 (catfish family 
Ictaluridae).

The derivation and assumptions for the baseline data are 
described in the FSIS Draft Catfish Risk Assessment (USDA FSIS, 
December 2010).  FSIS requests comments on the use of these 
assumptions in the FSIS draft risk assessment. 
C. Break‐even Analysis
USDA has conducted a breakeven analysis that shows the 
number of new illnesses from Salmonella spp. that would need to 
be prevented to ensure that benefits in terms of the dollar 
savings from reduced medical costs and deaths, and the value of 
Quality Adjusted Life Days (QALDs)(FDA, 2009) to exceed the 
additional costs.  The analysis (Table 22) illustrates the 
minimum effectiveness required for positive net benefits for 
each scenario: scenario #1 (Siluriformes) and scenario #2 
(Ictaluridae).
103
 
 
 
      
 
  
 
       
  
 
 
 
    
      
  
 
  
 
 
 
We note there may be benefits from reduced exposure to 
other pathogenic microorganisms and chemical residues in catfish
and catfish food products not captured by these Salmonella spp. 
based estimate.
For the scenario #1, applying the proposed regulations to 
Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products, using the 
projected cost of an average case of Salmonella spp. of about 
$18,000, roughly 790 illnesses would need to be averted for 
benefits to exceed costs. If we assume the projected baseline 
human illnesses from the FSIS draft catfish risk assessment 
(USDA FSIS, December 2010) of about 2,300 new salmonellosis 
cases per year, then this is about 34 percent inspection 
effectiveness in reducing those new illnesses to where benefits 
exceed costs. This yields about 790 new illnesses avoided per 
year suggesting that the benefits may exceed costs under these 
assumptions (see Table 22).
For the scenario #2, applying the proposed regulations to 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products, using the 
projected cost of an average case of Salmonella spp. of about 
$18,000, roughly 590 illnesses would need to be averted for 
benefits to exceed costs. If we assume the projected baseline 
human illnesses from the FSIS draft catfish risk assessment
(USDA FSIS, December 2010) of about 1,764 new salmonellosis 
cases per year, then this is about 33 percent inspection 
104
 
 
 
 
    
  
effectiveness in reducing those new illnesses to where benefits 
exceed costs. This yields about 590 new illnesses avoided per 
year suggesting that the benefits may exceed costs under these 
assumptions (see Table 22).

VI.  Summary 
Summarizing the benefits, for scenario #1 and #2, the 
analysis anticipates that all catfish and catfish food product 
establishments would be in compliance with the requirements for 
SSOPs and HACCP by the end of the phased implementation outlined
in the preamble of the proposed rule.  From discussions with 
industry experts, FSIS believes that a significant share of the 
domestic catfish and catfish food products industry is compliant 
with many of the individual proposed measures; although because 
of differences between FDA and FSIS regulations, FSIS believes 
the industry would need time to make adjustments.  Even though 
domestic compliance rates for HACCP related activities may be 
relatively high, the performance of HACCP systems depends on how 
well all the elements – hazard analysis, monitoring of CCPs and 
106
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
     
 
  
 
  
critical limits, recordkeeping, verification -- are being 
performed. 
Summarizing the additional costs, for scenario #1, the 
projected additional mean total one-time first-year cost to the 
Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products domestic supply 
chain industries and to FSIS of the proposed measures is about 
$1.3 million.  The projected additional mean total first year 
cost, including the additional one-time cost and annual cost, to 
the Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products supply chain 
industries and to FSIS of the proposed measures is about $15.4
million. The projected additional mean annual costs after the 
first year to industry are about $240,000.  The projected total 
annualized average cost to the Siluriformes catfish and catfish 
food products supply chain industries of the provisions of the 
proposal analyzed is about $0.0008 per pound of aggregate 
catfish and catfish food products. 
Summarizing the additional costs, for scenario #2, the 
projected additional mean total one-time first-year cost to the 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products domestic supply 
chain industries and to FSIS of the proposed measures is about 
$1.2 million.  The projected additional mean total first year 
cost, including the additional one-time cost and annual cost, to 
the Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products supply chain 
industries and to FSIS of the proposed measures is about $11.7

million. The projected additional mean annual costs after the 
first year to industry are about $230,000.  The projected total 
annualized average cost to the Ictaluridae catfish and catfish 
food products domestic supply chain industries of the provisions 
of the proposal analyzed is about $0.0011 per pound of aggregate 
Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products.
The cost to the catfish and catfish food products industry 
compares to a 2006-2008 average price of $0.83 per pound for 
frozen whole Ictaluridae catfish,
25 
$1.14 per pound for frozen 
Ictaluridae catfish fillets,
26 
and $0.402 per pound for frozen 
Ictaluridae catfish nuggets.
27 
These costs compare to projected 
cost of about 1 cent per pound of meat and poultry associated 
with the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 
Points (PR/HACCP) rule of 1996 (Ollinger and Mueller, 2003).

VII.  Effects on Small Entities to Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Administrator certifies that, for the purposes of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-602), this proposed 
rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, under either scenarios, in 
the United States.  While this action would affect a substantial 
number of small entities, the action would likely not have a

Exhibit A.  Economic Model – Schedules of Costs for Scenarios
In the following two tables, the schedules of costs for 
each of the two scenarios for defining catfish are detailed by 
year. These are the costs projected for each of the components 
that are given in Tables 6 through 17 of the preliminary 
regulatory impact analysis (PRIA).  The totals are summarized in 
Table 18 of the PRIA.  The totals in these tables are the 10­
year total without applying any discount for determining the 
present values. The determination of the present values at 7 
percent over 10 years for each of these cost components was done

Exhibit B. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
The Administrator certifies that, for the purposes of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-602), this proposed 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, under either scenarios, in 
the United States.  While this action will affect a substantial 
number of small entities, the action will likely not have a 
significant effect on these small entities in the United States, 
as indicated in this initial regulatory flexibility analysis 
(IRFA).
FSIS considered two possible definitions for catfish:  
North American fish belonging to the family Ictaluridae, and all 
fish of the order Siluriformes. If catfish are defined as all 
fish of the order Siluriformes, FSIS will inspect domestic and 
imported catfish, including basa and swai.  If defined as fish 
of the family Ictaluridae, FSIS will inspect virtually all 
domestically produced and about 20-25 percent of imported 
Siluriformes. USDA is asking for public comments on the scope 
of the definition and will fully define and describe the term in 
the final rule.
The IRFA, therefore, describes the affected small 
businesses under both scenarios: Scenario #1 (Siluriformes) and 
Scenario #2 (Ictaluridae.) Scenario #1 principally affects 
about 1,300 commercial catfish farms, 15 commercial catfish feed 
117
 
 
 
 
 
 
mills, 11 commercial catfish loader/hauler (live-hauling) 
transporters, 23 catfish slaughter and primary processor 
establishments, 10 catfish further (secondary) processing-only 
establishments, and 80 catfish broker/importers for a total of 
1,439 entities. Of these 1,439 entities, all but 4 large 
catfish slaughter and primary processors meet the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) size criteria for small businesses in the 
food manufacturing classification or other categories, in that 
they have 500 or fewer employees. See Tables 3 of Section II-A 
of the PRIA. Scenario #2 includes all the entities of scenario 
#1 except 62 of 80 importer entities. All of the importer 
entities are considered to be small because they have 500 or 
less full-time equivalent (FTE) employees.  The 4 large catfish 
slaughter and processing entities are considered to be large 
because they have more than 500 FTE employees. The proposed 
action would affect a substantial number of small entities 
because the requirements would apply to all processing 
establishments in the catfish and catfish products industry that 
ship their products in interstate commerce and would to some 
extent pertain to fish-farming practices and live-haul 
transporters. However, the action would not have a significant 
effect on these small entities, as indicated in this IRFA. 
As discussed in the Cost Analysis, Section V of the PRIA, 
the projected additional average total annualized cost to the 
118
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
                                                 
  
 
  
 
  
  
domestic catfish and catfish products supply chain industries of 
the provisions of the proposal analyzed is about $0.0008 per 
pound ($240,000 / 285 million pounds, in 2007) of aggregate 
domestic and imported processed catfish and catfish products for 
scenario #1. For scenario #2, the additional annualized total 
cost is about $0.0011 per pound ($230,000 / 204 million pounds, 
in 2007). The projected additional average cost ($0.0008 to 
$0.0011 per pound of processed catfish and catfish products) of 
compliance to the provisions of the proposal compares to a 2006­
2008 average price of $0.83 per pound (round or live weight) for 
frozen unprocessed whole catfish,
29 
$1.14 per pound for frozen 
processed catfish fillets,
30 
and $0.40 per pound for frozen 
processed catfish nuggets.
31 
From the discussion in the Additional Agency Costs, Section 
I of the PRIA, NOAA / NMFS charges catfish processing entities 
about $0.009 per pound for its inspection service. Thus, for 
scenario #1, NOAA / NMFS inspection cost plus FSIS’s projected 
additional inspection cost equals about $0.0098 (0.009 + 0.0008) 
per pound (processed weight) of domestic catfish products. For 
scenario #2, NOAA / NMFS inspection cost plus FSIS’s projected 
29 Wholesale price. Source;  Catfish Market Statistics, National Agricultural 
Statistics Service, USDA.

Statistics Service, USDA.
31 Wholesale price. Source: Catfish Market Statistics Annual, National 
Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA.
119
 
 
 
 
 
additional inspection cost equals about $0.01 (0.009 + 0.0011) 
per pound. However, under this proposal, FSIS will not charge 
the catfish and catfish products processing industry for 
ordinary inspection services. This is a cost savings of about 
$0.009 per pound of domestic catfish and catfish products for 
NOAA / NMFS inspection service to about 18 of the catfish 
processing entities that used NOAA inspection service, including 
about 14 that are small processing entities. 
This projected additional average total cost of $0.0008 
(scenario #1) to $0.0011 (scenario #2) per pound of catfish to 
processing entities for compliance to FSIS’s HACCP and 
Sanitation SOPs (SSOPs) compares to an estimated total cost of 
about $0.01 per pound of meat and poultry associated with the 
Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points 
(PR/HACCP) rule of 1996 (Ollinger and Mueller, 2003).  
Therefore, if the projected additional total HACCP and SSOPs 
compliance cost is about $0.0008 per pound (scenario #1) or 
$0.0011 per pound (scenario #2) of processed catfish products to 
processing entities, then the additional compliance cost 
represents a relatively small proportion of the average sales 
prices of the fabricated catfish and catfish products that range 
from $0.40 per pound for nuggets to $1.14 per pound for frozen 
catfish fillets.
120
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
      
 
 
In Table 1B below, there are projected disaggregated mean 
total additional costs of the proposed measures for the affected 
1,435 small entities of scenario #1 and 1,373 small entities of 
scenario #2. For scenario #1, the total additional annualized 
cost is about $204,400 for the 1,435 small entities or an 
additional average annualized cost of about $142 ($204,400 / 
1,435) per small entity. This compares to an additional 
compliance cost of about $240,000 for both the 1,435 small and 
the 4 large entities – a total of 1,439 entities. This is an 
additional average cost of about $167 ($240,000 / 1,439) per 
entity (small and large).
For scenario #2, the total additional annualized cost is 
about $195,100 for the 1,373 small entities or an additional 
average annualized cost of about $142 ($195,100 / 1,373) per 
small entity. This compares to an additional compliance cost of 
about $230,000 for both the 1,373 small and the 4 large entities 
– a total of 1,377 entities. This is an additional average 
annualized cost of about $167 ($230,000 / 1,377) per entity 
(small and large).
When disaggregated by sector, Tables 2B (scenario #1) and 
3B (scenario #2) below, there are 29 small entities of the total 
33 processing (primary plus secondary) entities. Of the 29 
small processing entities, 19 are small slaughter/primary 
processors and 10 are small secondary processing-only entities.  
121
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
For the 19 small primary processors, the projected mean 
annualized total aggregated costs per entity affected, at a 7% 
discount rate over 10 years, is about $4,668 ($88,700 / 19).  
However, the estimated annual aggregated catfish and catfish 
products revenue of the 19 primary processing entities is about 
$463 million. Thus, the estimated annual aggregated catfish and 
catfish products revenue is about $24 million ($463 million / 
19) per small primary processing entity. Therefore, the 
projected proportion of this additional cost to estimated 
revenue is relatively small at about 0.02 percent ($4,668 / $24 
million) per slaughter/primary processing entity.
There are about 10 small secondary catfish and catfish 
products processing-only entities.  For the 10 small secondary 
processors entities, the projected mean annualized total 
aggregated costs per entity affected, at a 7% discount rate over 
10 years, is about $5,300 ($53,100 / 10).  However, the 
estimated annual aggregated catfish and catfish products revenue 
of the 10 secondary processing entities is about $180 million. 
Thus, the estimated annual aggregated catfish and catfish 
products revenue is about $18 million ($180 million / 10) per 
small secondary processing entity. Therefore, the proportion of 
this projected additional cost to estimated revenue is 
relatively small at about 0.03 percent ($5,300 / $18 million) 
per secondary processing entity.
122
 
 
 
     
 
 
     
 
 
     
For the 1,300 small entities of the catfish producers the 
projected mean annualized total aggregated costs per entity 
affected, at a 7% discount rate over 10 years, is about $20 
($25,800 / 1,300). However, the estimated annual aggregated 
catfish revenue for the 1,300 catfish production entities is 
about $359.2 million. Thus, the estimated annual aggregated 
catfish revenue is about $300,000 ($359 million / 1,300) per 
small catfish-producer entity.  Therefore, the proportion of 
this projected additional cost to estimated revenue is 
relatively small at about 0.007 percent ($20 / $300,000) per 
catfish-producer entity. 
For the 15 small entities of the catfish feed mills, the 
projected mean annualized total aggregated costs per entity 
affected, at a 7% discount rate over 10 years, is about $20 
($300 / 15). However, the estimated annual aggregated catfish 
feed mill revenue for the 15 catfish feed mill entities is about 
$159.8 million. Thus, the estimated annual aggregated catfish-
feed-mill revenue is about $11 million ($160 million / 15) per 
small catfish-feed-mill entity.  Therefore, the proportion of 
this projected additional cost to estimated revenue is 
relatively small at about 0.0002 percent ($20 / $276,000) per 
catfish-feed-mill entity.
For the 11 small entities of commercial catfish loader-
hauler (live-hauling) transporters, the projected mean 
123
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
annualized total aggregated costs per entity affected, at a 7% 
discount rate over 10 years, is about $2,000 ($23,700 / 11). 
However, the estimated annual aggregated catfish loader-hauler 
revenue for the 11 commercial catfish live-hauling transporter 
entities is about $15 million.  Thus, the estimated annual 
aggregated catfish live-hauling transporter revenue is about 
$1.4 million ($15 million / 11) per small catfish live-hauling 
transporter entity. Therefore, the proportion of this projected 
additional cost to estimated revenue is relatively small at 
about 0.15 percent ($2,000 / $1.4 million) per catfish live-
hauling transporter entity.
For scenario #1, for the 80 small entities of commercial 
catfish broker/importers the projected mean annualized total 
aggregated costs per entity affected, at a 7% discount rate over 
10 years, is about $160 ($12,800 / 80). However, the estimated 
annual aggregated catfish broker/importers revenue for the 80 
commercial catfish broker/importers entities is about $160 
million of catfish and catfish products.  Thus, the estimated 
annual aggregated catfish and catfish products broker/importers 
revenue is about $2.0 million ($158 million / 80) per small 
catfish broker/importer entity. Therefore, the proportion of 
this projected additional cost to estimated revenue is 
relatively small at about 0.008 percent ($160 / $2.0 million) 
per catfish broker/importer entity.
124
 
 
 
     
 
   
 
     
For scenario #2, for the 18 small entities of commercial 
catfish broker/importers the projected mean annualized total 
aggregated costs per entity affected, at a 7% discount rate over 
10 years, is about $194 ($3,500 / 18). However, the estimated 
annual aggregated catfish broker/importers revenue for the 18 
commercial catfish broker/importers entities is about $36 
million of catfish and catfish products.  Thus, the estimated 
annual aggregated catfish and catfish products broker/importers 
revenue is about $2.0 million ($36 million / 18) per small 
catfish broker/importer entity. Therefore, the proportion of 
this projected additional cost to estimated revenue is 
relatively small at about 0.01 percent ($194 / $2.0 million) per 
catfish broker/importer entity.
Scenario #1 and scenario #2 will have an unknown effect on a 
substantial number of foreign small entities that export catfish 
and catfish products to the United States. Imported catfish and 
catfish products will have to be inspected under a foreign 
system that is equivalent to that of the United States and from 
establishments that the foreign inspection authority has 
certified as complying with United States requirements.
This proposed rule would directly and indirectly affect 
multiple sectors of the U.S. economy. These effects are likely 
on numerous small firms, jobs (i.e., employment) and on the 
government (i.e., local, state and federal).  Some of the likely 
125
 
 
 
 
      
 
affected (directly and indirectly) sectors, in addition to the 
types of entities already mentioned in Exhibit B, Table 2, 
include food service and restaurant firms, consumers, and 
government agencies.
FSIS is asking for more information on how this proposed 
action will affect domestic and foreign entities. Then, this 
information will be analyzed in the final regulatory impact 
analysis (FRIA) of the final rule.
