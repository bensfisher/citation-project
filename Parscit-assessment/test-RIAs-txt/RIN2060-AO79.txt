SECTION 1 

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 

1.1 Background 
On December 26, 2007, President Bush signed the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations 
Amendment, which authorized funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to 
develop and publish a draft rule on an accelerated schedule:  
[N]ot less than $3,500,000 shall be provided for activities to develop and publish 
a draft rule not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and a 
final rule not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to 
require mandatory reporting of GHG emissions above appropriate threshold in all 
sectors of the economy. 
The accompanying explanatory statement stated that EPA shall “use its existing authority 
under the Clean Air Act” to develop a mandatory GHG reporting rule.  
The agency is further directed to include in its rule reporting of emission resulting 
from upstream production and downstream sources, to the extent that the 
Administrator deems it appropriate. The Administrator shall determine 
appropriate thresholds of emissions above which reporting is required, and how 
frequently reports shall be submitted to EPA. The Administrator shall have 
discretion to use existing reporting requirements for electric generating units 
under Section 821 of the Clean Air Act. 
EPA is considering different options for the design of the reporting rule, including 
options that have different thresholds above which sources must measure and report their GHG 
emissions. The estimated costs and benefits for some alternatives are likely to exceed $100 
million. Hence, a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be developed.  
1.2 Role of the Regulatory Impact Analysis in the Rulemaking Process 
1.2.1 Legislative Roles 
This report analyzes the estimated regulatory impacts of the mandatory reporting 
program that EPA has developed, in accordance with the FY08 Appropriations language, under 
the authority of Sections 114 and 208 of the Clean Air Act [CAA]. Section 114 provides EPA 
broad authority to collect data for the purpose of “carrying out any provision” of the Act (except 
for a provision of Title II with respect to manufacturers of new motor vehicles or new motor 
1-1 

  
                                                 
       
  
 
vehicle engines). Section 114(a)1 of the CAA authorizes the Administrator to, inter alia, require 
certain persons (see below) on a one-time, periodic or continuous basis to keep records, make 
reports, undertake monitoring, sample emissions, or provide such other information as the 
Administrator may reasonably require. This information may be required of any person who (i) 
owns or operates an emission source, (ii) manufactures control or process equipment, (iii) the 
Administrator believes may have information necessary for the purposes set forth in this section, 
or (iv) is subject to any requirement of the Act (except for manufacturers subject to certain title II 
requirements). The information may be required for the purposes of developing an 
implementation plan, an emission standard under sections 111, 112 or 129, determining if any 
person is in violation of any standard or requirement of an implementation plan or emissions 
standard, or “carrying out any provision” of the Act (except for a provision of title II with respect 
to manufacturers of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines).2 Section 208 of the CAA 
provides EPA with similar broad authority regarding the manufacturers of new motor vehicles or 
new motor vehicle engines, and other persons subject to the requirements of parts A and C of 
title II.  
The scope of the persons potentially subject to a section 114(a)(1) information request 
(e.g., a person “who the Administrator believes may have information necessary for the purposes 
set forth in” section 114(a)) and the reach of the phrase “carrying out any provision” of the Act 
are quite broad. EPA’s authority to request information reaches to a source not subject to the 
CAA, and may be used for purposes relevant to any provision of the Act. Thus, for example, 
utilizing sections 114 and 208, EPA could gather information relevant to carrying out provisions 
involving research (e.g., section 103(g)); evaluating and setting standards (e.g., section 111); and 
endangerment determinations contained in specific provisions of the Act (e.g., 202); as well as 
other programs.  
While the Agency has published (July 11, 2008) an advanced notice of proposed 
rulemaking to explore the broader policy implications of regulating GHGs under the CAA, the 
Agency believes that establishing a mandatory reporting program for facilities emitting GHGs or
supplying fuel and chemicals that will eventually be emitted as GHGs is necessary in order to 
inform and analyze future climate policy. This rule intends to provide a comprehensive data that 
cover a broad range of sectors in the economy, thereby establishing a solid foundation on which 
informed future climate decisions may be made. 
1The joint explanatory statement refers to “Section 821 of the Clean Air Act” but section 821 was part of the 1990 
CAA Amendments and was not codified into the CAA itself. 
2Although there are exclusions in section 114(a)(1) regarding certain title II requirements applicable to
manufacturers of new motor vehicle and motor vehicle engines, section 208 authorizes the gathering of
information related to those areas.  
1-2 

  
 
 
                                                 
 
The Agency considered a wide range of determining factors when selecting the 
recommended alternative for this rule. These included the consideration of costs and benefits, 
which are essential to making efficient, cost-effective decisions for implementation of these 
standards. Other important considerations included the language of the Appropriations Act and 
the accompanying explanatory statement related to source categories; consistency with other 
CAA or state-level regulatory programs that typically require facility or unit level data and; the 
relative accuracy of different monitoring approaches and the monitoring methods already in use 
within the regulated industries; and the potential burden placed on small businesses associated 
with a range of reporting thresholds. 
This RIA is intended to inform the public about the selection criteria for this rule, which 
include, but are not limited to, the potential costs and benefits that may result when the
mandatory reporting program is implemented. 
1.2.2 Role of Statutory and Executive Orders 
There are several statutes and executive orders that dictate the manner in which EPA 
considers rulemaking and that apply to any public documentation. The analysis required by these 
statutes and executive orders is presented in Section 6. 
EPA presents this RIA pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the guidelines of Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-4 and EPA’s Economic Guidelines.3 These 
documents present guidelines for EPA to assess the benefits and costs of the selected regulatory 
option, as well as options that are more stringent or less stringent. The costs of the proposed 
mandatory reporting program are described in Section 4 of this RIA; the economic impact 
analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis of the program are presented in Section 4. The benefits 
of the proposed rule are discussed in Section 5. 
1.2.3 Market Failure or Other Social Purpose 
OMB Circular A-4 indicates that one of the reasons a regulation such as the proposed 
rule may be issued is to address market failure. The major categories of market failure include 
inadequate or asymmetric information, externalities, and market power. The proposed mandatory 
GHG reporting rule seeks to address inadequate or asymmetric information between and among 
GHG emitters and various other stakeholders including the public.  
3U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Circular A-4, September 17, 2003: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ 
circulars/a004/a-4.pdf.

While some sectors of the U.S. economy report emissions of GHGs, and there are other 
sources of information about GHG emissions, the proposed rule would provide comprehensive 
data on emissions from sources throughout the economy. There currently is significant variation 
in which sectors of the U.S. economy report GHG emissions and methods used for calculations. 
As a result, existing information is inadequate or various stakeholders have very different 
information on which to base decisions about GHG emission levels and possible reductions. 
An externality occurs when one party’s actions impose uncompensated benefits or costs 
on another party. Environmental problems are a classic case of externality. Although not its 
primary focus of the proposed rule, the GHG reporting program will provide information on for 
future climate policies designed to address externalities. Since GHGs are an externality, the lack 
of information on their emissions means the information asymmetry leads to an inefficient 
outcome, and providing such information is a necessary step to internalize the externality.  
1.2.4 Illustrative Nature of the Analysis 
This analysis is illustrative of the types of costs and benefits that may accrue as a result of 
the program. The estimates of costs reflect existing production levels in each affected sector, and 
estimates of emissions are based on 2006 data. When the reporting program takes effect, actual 
patterns of economic activity and emissions may differ from current conditions. However, these 
data provide estimates of baseline conditions and estimated costs of compliance. 
1.3 Overview and Design of the RIA 
This RIA comprises seven sections. Following this introductory section, Section 2 
describes affected sectors of the economy and reviews existing reporting programs. Section 3 
describes the development of the proposed rule, including control options and analyses of 
alternative scenarios. Section 4 characterizes baseline conditions and presents engineering 
estimates of the costs of complying with the proposed rule. Section 5 presents an assessment of 
the monitoring and reporting costs by sector, an examination of uncertainty related to 
measurement accuracy of monitoring methods prescribed, and an assessment of potential impacts 
on small entities. Section 6 presents a qualitative examination of potential benefits of the 
proposed rule. Section 7 provides a discussion of the Agency’s compliance with executive orders 
and other statutes during the development of the proposed rule. Section 8 describes EPA’s 
conclusions and findings. 
1.3.1 Baseline and Years of Analysis 
Data used for the analysis represent the most recent data available on estimates of GHG 
emission by sector, productive capacity, existing emissions monitoring, and reporting activities 
1-4 

  
 
by sector. While EPA recognizes that economic growth and changes in the structure of the 
economy over time will likely result in changes in both emissions and costs by sector, attempting 
to project these changes would lead to an increased level of uncertainty without conveying 
comparable improvements in the assessment. Thus, EPA uses data representing essentially 
current conditions as a proxy for conditions present when the rule takes effect. Such estimates 
are inherently uncertain because data needed for more precise measurements are not available. 
The data collected by the rule would greatly enhance future estimates. 
1.3.2 Developing the Proposed GHG Reporting Rule Considered in this RIA 
In order to ensure a comprehensive consideration of GHG emissions, EPA organized the 
development of the proposed rule around seven categories of processes that emit GHGs: 
(1) fossil fuel combustion: stationary, (2) fossil fuel combustion: mobile, (3) fuel suppliers, 
(4) industrial processes, (5) industrial GHG suppliers, (6) fossil fuel fugitive emissions, and 
(7) biological processes. For each category, EPA evaluated the requirements of existing GHG 
reporting programs, obtained input from stakeholders, analyzed reporting options, and developed 
the general reporting requirements and specific requirements for each of the GHG emitting 
processes. 
EPA examined existing GHG reporting programs prior to developing the proposed rule. 
Although the mandatory GHG rule is unique, EPA carefully considered other federal and state 
programs during development of the proposed rule. One of EPA’s goal was to develop a 
reporting rule that, to the extent possible and appropriate, is consistent with existing GHG 
emission estimation and reporting methodologies in order to reduce the burden of reporting for 
all parties involved. We document our review of GHG monitoring protocols for each source 
category used by federal, state, regional, and international voluntary and mandatory GHG 
programs, and our review of state mandatory GHG rules. The proposed monitoring and GHG 
calculation methodologies for many source categories are the same as, or similar to, the 
methodologies contained in state reporting programs. 
EPA’s overall rulemaking approach began with identification of anthropogenic sources in 
the U.S. GHG Inventory and International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The proposed rule 
would require reporting of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and other fluorinated compounds 
(e.g., NF3 and HFEs) as defined in the rule. The . The IPCC focuses on CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and SF6 for both scientific assessments and emissions inventory 
purposes because these are long-lived, well-mixed GHGs not controlled by the Montreal 
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. These GHGs are directly emitted by 
1-5 

                                                  
  
    
human activities, are reported annually in EPA’s Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
and Sinks, and are the common focus of the climate change research community. The IPCC also 
included methods for accounting for emissions from several specified fluorinated gases in the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.4 These gases include 
fluorinated ethers, which are used in electronics and anesthetics and as heat transfer fluids. Like 
the other six GHGs that must be reported, these fluorinated compounds are long-lived in the 
atmosphere and have high global warming potentials (GWPs). In many cases these fluorinated 
gases are used in expanding industries (e.g., electronics) or as substitutes for HFCs. As such, 
EPA is proposing to include reporting of these gases to ensure that the Agency has an accurate 
understanding of the emissions and uses of these gases, particularly as those uses expand.  
EPA then conducted a review of existing methodologies and reporting programs (e.g., 
California Air Resources Board [CARB], The Climate Registry [TCR], 1605b of the Energy 
Policy Act). EPA’s review of existing reporting programs and measurement methodologies 
employed by existing federal and state programs is described in Section II of the Preamble to the 
Proposed Rule. EPA used this information to inform its selection of measurement and reporting 
methods for this rulemaking. 
 Once EPA had a complete list of source categories relevant to the U.S., the Agency 
systematically reviewed those source categories against the following criteria to develop the list 
to the source categories included in the proposal:  
(1) include source categories that emit the most significant amounts of GHG emissions, 
while also minimizing the number of reporters, and  
(2) include source categories that can be measured with an appropriate level of accuracy. 
Source categories that would be required to report were identified. Sources were then screened 
by several key criteria, looking at the number of reporters versus the coverage of emissions under 
various thresholds, relevant and appropriate measurement methodologies, measurement 
accuracy, and administrative burden. Based on the source level screening activities, possible 
reporting methodologies for the selected sources were developed. The reporting methodologies 
identified fall into several categories including, direct measurement, calculating emissions based 
on site-specific information, and calculating emissions based on default emissions factors. In 
general, for the proposed rule, EPA selected a combination of direct emission measurement and 
calculations based on site-specific information. 
4The 2006 IPCC Guidelines are found here: http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/methodology-reports.htm. For additional
information on these gases please see Table A-1 in proposed 40 CFR part 98, subpart A and the Industrial GHG 
Suppliers Technical Support Document (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-141). 
1-6 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once the source categories and methodologies had been identified, EPA evaluated 
different rule options across the following dimensions: 
 Threshold (level of emissions below which entities are not required to report); 
– 	 1,000 tons CO2e/year; 
– 	 10,000 tons CO2e/year; 
– 	 25,000 tons CO2e/year; 
– 	 100,000 tons CO2e/year; 
– 	 Equivalent capacity based threshold where data exists; 
 Methodology for measuring emissions; 
– 	 Direct measurement; 
– 	 Facility specific calculation methods; 
– 	 Default emissions factors; 
 Frequency of reporting: Annually, quarterly, or some other frequency; 
 Verification responsibility: EPA, third party, or self-certification without independent 
verification?
The Agency examined several options for each dimension to identify the preferred or
recommended option. The options and alternatives evaluated are described in detail in Section 3. 
Section 4 details the engineering cost analysis which outlines the monitoring and reporting 
activities and costs for each source required to report. 
1.3.3 Evaluating Costs and Benefits 
To assist in the selection of the recommended option EPA conducted an economic impact 
analysis across the above dimensions. EPA estimated the costs of complying with each of the 
reporting alternatives, and assessed the cost-effectiveness of each alternative by examining the 
costs per million metric ton of CO2 equivalent (MMtCO2e) reported. This cost-effectiveness 
metric was considered in combination with other important factors such as the potential impacts 
on small entities, consistency with other CAA or state-level regulatory programs and monitoring 
methods already in use within the regulated industries.  
1.4 Recommended Greenhouse Gas Reporting Alternative 
The recommend option for this proposed rule is outlined below. Section 5 provides cost 
comparisons for each alternative evaluated under the following four dimensions. The 
recommended option strikes a balance between impacts on small entities, consistency with other 
programs, costs incurred by the reporting entities, and emissions coverage.  
1-7 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Threshold: Hybrid approach 
– 	 A facility that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e/year reports emissions from all 
sources for which there are methods or  
– 	 An equivalent capacity threshold for source categories where data exist 
– 	 An “all-in” threshold for source categories where analyses indicate that all 
facilities emit more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e/year or that only a few facilities 
emit marginally below this level. 
– 	 May select other thresholds where already reporting (e.g., Acid Rain Program
[ARP]) or due to unique issues (e.g., GHG generation threshold for landfills) 
– 	 Equivalent capacity threshold provided where data exist 
 Methodology: Combination of direct measurement and source-specific calculation 
methodologies 
– 	 Direct measurement of emissions from units at facilities that are already required 
to collect and report data using continuous emission monitoring systems under 
other Federally enforceable programs, including for other regulatory programs
(e.g., CO2 emissions from Electricity Generating Units [EGUs] in ARP;
requirements of NSPS, NESHAP, SIP) 
– 	 Source-specific calculation methods using facility-specific information for other 
sources at the facility  
 Frequency: Annual 
– 	 All reporters
– 	 Exception: those already reporting quarterly for existing mandatory programs
(e.g., Acid Rain Program, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Energy 
Information Administration) 
 Verification: Self-certification with EPA verification

SECTION 2 

REGULATORY BACKGROUND 

The intent of this proposed rule is to collect accurate and timely GHG emissions data that 
can be used to inform future policies. Although the mandatory GHG rule is unique, EPA 
carefully considered other federal and state programs during development of the proposed rule. 
The reporting program will supplement rather than duplicate other U.S. government GHG 
programs. We outline EPA’s overall rulemaking approach, sources considered, and summarize 
our review of GHG monitoring protocols for each source category used by federal, state, 
regional, and international voluntary and mandatory GHG programs, and our review of state 
mandatory GHG rules below. For example, the proposed monitoring and GHG calculation 
methodologies for many source categories are the same as, or similar to, the methodologies 
contained in state reporting programs. The remainder of the section provides an overview of 
related existing programs and discusses their relevance in the development of this rule.
2.1 EPA’s Overall Rulemaking Approach 
In response to the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Amendment, EPA has developed 
this proposed rulemaking. The components of this development are explained in the following 
subsections. 
2.1.1 Identifying the Goals of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting System 
The mandatory reporting program will provide comprehensive and accurate data which 
will inform future climate change policies. Potential future climate policies include research and 
development initiatives, economic incentives, new or expanded voluntary programs, adaptation 
strategies, emission standards, a carbon tax, or a cap-and-trade program. Because we do not 
know at this time the specific policies that will be adopted, the data reported through the 
mandatory reporting system should be of sufficient quality to support a range of approaches. 
Also, consistent with the Appropriations Amendment, the reporting rule proposes to cover a 
broad range of sectors of the economy.  
To these ends, we identified the following goals of the mandatory reporting system: 
 Obtain data that is of sufficient quality that it can be used to support a range of future 
climate change policies and regulations. 
 Balance the rule coverage to maximize the amount of emissions reported while 
excluding small emitters.  
2-1 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Create reporting requirements that are consistent with existing GHG reporting 
programs by using existing GHG emission estimation and reporting methodologies to 
reduce reporting burden, where feasible. 
2.1.2 Developing the Proposed Rule 
In order to ensure a comprehensive consideration of GHG emissions, EPA organized the 
development of the proposed rule around seven categories of processes that emit GHGs: 
(1) fossil fuel combustion: stationary, (2) fossil fuel combustion: mobile, (3) fuel suppliers, 
(4) industrial processes, (5) industrial GHG suppliers, (6) fossil fuel fugitive emissions, and 
(7) biological processes. For each category, EPA evaluated the requirements of existing GHG 
reporting programs, obtained input from stakeholders, analyzed reporting options, and developed 
the general reporting requirements and specific requirements for each of the GHG emitting 
processes. 
2.1.3 Evaluation of Existing Greenhouse Gas Reporting Programs 
A number of State and regional GHG reporting systems currently are in place or under 
development. EPA’s goal is to develop a reporting rule that, to the extent possible and 
appropriate, would rely on similar protocols and formats of the existing programs and, therefore, 
reduce the burden of reporting for all parties involved. Therefore, each of the work groups 
performed a comprehensive review of existing voluntary and mandatory GHG reporting 
programs, as well as guidance documents for quantifying GHG emissions from specific sources. 
These GHG reporting programs and guidance documents included the following: 
 International programs, including the IPCC, the EU Emissions Trading System, and 
the Environment Canada reporting rule; 
 U.S. national programs, such as the U.S. GHG inventory, the ARP, DOE 1605(b) 
voluntary registry, and voluntary GHG partnership programs (e.g., Natural Gas 
STAR); 
 State and regional GHG reporting programs, such as TCR, RGGI, and programs in 
California, New Mexico, and New Jersey; 
 Reporting protocols developed by nongovernmental organizations, such as 
WRI/WBCSD; and  
 Programs from industrial trade organizations, such as the American Petroleum
Institute’s Compendium of GHG Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas 
Industry and the Cement Sustainability Initiative’s CO2 Accounting and Reporting 
Standard for the Cement Industry, developed by WBCSD.
2-2 

  
 
 
 
 
In reviewing these programs, we analyzed the sectors covered, thresholds for reporting, 
approach to indirect emissions reporting, the monitoring or emission estimating methods used, 
the measures to assure the quality of the reported data, the point of monitoring, data input needs, 
and information required to be reported and/or retained. We analyzed these provisions for 
suitability to a mandatory, Federal GHG reporting program, and compiled the information. A 
summary of existing reporting programs examined is provided in Section 2.4. The full review of 
existing GHG reporting programs and guidance may be found in the docket at EPA-HQ-OAR­
2008-0508-054. 
2.1.4 Stakeholder Outreach to Identify Reporting Issues 
Early in the development process, we conducted a proactive communications outreach 
program to inform the public about the rule development effort. We solicited input and 
maintained an open door policy for those interested in discussing the rulemaking. Since January 
2008, EPA staff have held more than 100 meetings with stakeholders, including the following: 
 trade associations and firms in potentially affected industries/sectors; 
 state, local, and tribal environmental control agencies and regional air quality 
planning organizations; 
 state and regional organizations already involved in GHG emissions reporting, such 
as TCR, CARB, and Western Climate Initiative (WCI); and 
 environmental groups and other nongovernmental organizations. 
 We also met with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), which have programs relevant to GHG emissions. 
During the meetings, we shared information about the statutory requirements and 
timetable for developing a rule. Stakeholders were encouraged to provide input on key issues. 
Examples of topics discussed included existing GHG monitoring and reporting programs and 
lessons learned, thresholds for reporting, schedules for reporting, scope of reporting, handling of 
confidential data, data verification, and the role of states in administering the program. As 
needed, the EPA technical workgroups followed up with these stakeholder groups on a variety of 
methodological, technical, and policy issues. EPA staff also provided information to tribes 
through conference calls with different Indian tribal working groups and organizations at EPA 
and through individual calls with tribal board members of TCR.  
For a full list of organizations EPA met with when development this proposal please see 
the memo found at EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-055.

2.1.5 Analysis of Emissions by Sector 
For each of the source categories mentioned in Section 2.4, EPA compiled information 
on current conditions in the category, including information about existing monitoring equipment 
or reporting frameworks, estimated emissions of GHGs, and estimated productive capacity or 
throughput. Incremental costs of measuring GHG emissions and conducting reporting activities 
were estimated under each scenario. The scenarios vary the conditions of the reporting rule with 
respect to the size of the firm required to report, the frequency of reporting, who verifies 
emissions, and the type of measurement required by sector. The scenarios are listed in Section 3.
EPA also reviewed the benefits to stakeholders, including the public, the government, and 
industry, of a reporting system in a qualitative analysis. These benefits are outlined in Section 5. 
2.2 Sources Considered 
Seven technical subgroups at EPA considered emissions sources from several broad 
categories, as shown in Table 2-1. Using screening criteria based on the feasibility of monitoring, 
verifying, and measuring these sources, the technical subgroups developed reporting 
methodologies for the sources in Table 2-2.

Industrial processes: Emissions result from the physical or chemical 
transformation of materials in the mineral (e.g., cement, lime, glass), metal
(e.g., iron, steel, ferroalloy, aluminum) and chemical (e.g., HCFC-22 
production, nitric acid, petrochemical) industries. 
Fugitive emissions1: Intentional and unintentional emissions result from the 
extraction, processing, storage, and transport of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and 
gas) to the point of final use.
Biological processes: Sources that may be considered include emissions 
from sources in the waste, agricultural, and forestry sectors (e.g., landfills, 
waste water treatment, and manure management operations).
Upstream  
Fuel suppliers Producers/refiners/importers: Reporting from fuel providers and importers 
(e.g., petroleum refiners and importers, coal mines, gas processing plants, 
LNG importers).  
Industrial gas suppliers Producers/importers: Reporting from producers and importers from
industrial gases (e.g., HFC, PFC, SF6, CO2, and N2O). 
Mobile Sources 
Mobile combustion Emissions from vehicles and engines in use: Reporting from vehicle 
manufacturers and heavy duty and nonroad engine manufacturers. Sources
include passenger cars, large/heavy duty truck cabs and chassis, light and
medium duty trucks and vans, motorcycles, and other miscellaneous vehicles 
and engines.  
1. This definition of fugitive emissions is derived from the definition of fugitives outlined in the 2006 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and is consistent
with the use of the term in the development of GHG inventories. In non-GHG related reporting efforts, fugitives are 
more narrowly defined to be emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other
functionally-equivalent opening. 
Some source categories were excluded as a result of this screening step, such as 
emissions from land use changes and agricultural soils, fugitive emissions from selected oil and 
gas operations, and vehicle fleets. Vehicle fleet emissions are covered by reporting from fuel 
suppliers as part of the oil and gas production. Other emissions sources were excluded due to the 
large uncertainty associated with measuring, monitoring, and verifying the emissions. Further

detail regarding the rationale for the exclusion of sources can be found in Section IV of the 
Preamble for this rule.

Consistent with the appropriations language regarding reporting of emissions from
“downstream sources,” EPA is proposing reporting requirements from facilities that directly emit 
GHGs above a certain threshold as a result of combustion of fuel or processes. The majority of 
the direct emitters included in this proposal are large facilities in the electricity generation or 
industrial sectors. In addition, many of the electricity generation facilities are already reporting 
their CO2 emissions to EPA under existing regulations. As such, these facilities have only a 
2-6 

  
 
minimal increase in the amount of data they have to provide EPA on their CH4 and N2O 
emissions. The typical industrial facilities that are required to report under this proposal have 
emissions that are substantially higher than the proposed thresholds and are already doing many 
of the measurements and quantifications of emissions required by this proposal through existing 
business practices, voluntary programs, or mandatory state-level GHG reporting programs.  
For more information about the thresholds included in the proposal please refer to 
Section IV.C of the preamble and for more information about the requirements for specific 
sources refer to Section V of the preamble for the proposed rule.  
Consistent with the appropriations language regarding reporting of emissions from
“upstream production,” EPA is proposing reporting requirements from upstream suppliers of 
fossil fuel and industrial GHGs. In the context of GHG reporting, “upstream emissions” refers to 
the GHG emissions potential of a quantity of industrial gas or fossil fuel supplied into the 
economy. For fossil fuels, the emissions potential is the amount of CO2 that would be produced 
from complete combustion or oxidation of the carbon in the fuel. In many cases, the fossil fuels 
and industrial GHGs supplied by producers and importers are used and ultimately emitted by a 
large number of small sources, particularly in the commercial and residential sectors (e.g., HFCs 
emitted from home A/C units or GHG emissions from individual motor vehicles). To cover these 
direct emissions would require reporting by hundreds or thousands of small facilities. To avoid 
this impact, the proposed rule does not include all of those emitters, but instead requires 
reporting by the suppliers of industrial gases and suppliers of fossil fuels. Because the GHGs in 
these products are almost always fully emitted during use, reporting these supply data will 
provide an estimate of national emissions while substantially reducing the number of reporters. 
For this reason, the proposed rule requires reporting by suppliers of coal and coal-based 
products, petroleum products, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), CO2 gas, and other 
industrial GHGs. 
2.3 	 How the Proposed Mandatory GHG Reporting Program is Different from the 
Federal and State Programs EPA Reviewed 
The various existing state and federal programs EPA reviewed are diverse. They apply to 
different industries, have different thresholds, require different pollutants and different types of 
emissions sources to be reported, rely on different monitoring protocols, and require different 
types of data to be reported, depending on the purposes of each program. None of the existing 
programs require nationwide, mandatory GHG reporting by facilities in a large number of 
sectors, so EPA’s proposed mandatory GHG rule development effort is unique in this regard. 
2-7 

 Although the mandatory GHG rule is unique, EPA carefully considered other Federal and 
State programs during development of the proposed rule. Documentation of our review of GHG 
monitoring protocols for each source category used by Federal, State, and international voluntary 
and mandatory GHG programs, and our review of State mandatory GHG rules can be found at 
EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-056. The proposed monitoring and GHG calculation methodologies 
for many source categories are the same as, or similar to, the methodologies contained in State 
reporting programs such as TCR, CCAR, and State mandatory GHG reporting rules and similar 
to methodologies developed by EPA voluntary programs such as Climate Leaders. The reporting 
requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 75 are also being used for this proposed rule. Similarity in 
proposed methods will help maximize the ability of individual reporters to submit the emissions 
calculations to multiple programs, if desired. EPA also continues to work closely with states and 
state-based groups to ensure that the data management approach in this proposal will lead to 
efficient submission of data to multiple programs..  
The intent of this proposed rule is to collect a reasonable estimate of GHG emissions data 
that can be used to inform future policy decisions. One goal in developing the rule is to be 
consistent with the GHG protocols and requirements of other state and federal programs, where 
appropriate, in order to make use of existing cooperative efforts and reduce the burden to 
facilities submitting reports to other programs. However, we also need to be sure the mandatory 
reporting rule collects facility-specific data of sufficient quality to achieve the Agency’s 
objectives for this rule. The rule must require facilities to report all of the information EPA 
needs. Therefore, some reporting requirements of this proposed rule are different from other 
federal and state programs.  
2.4 Existing Reporting Programs 
A number of voluntary and mandatory GHG programs already exist or are being 
developed at the State, regional, and Federal levels. These programs have different scopes and 
purposes. Many focus on GHG emission reduction, whereas others are purely reporting 
programs. In addition to the GHG programs, other Federal emission reporting programs and 
emission inventories are relevant to the proposed GHG reporting rule. Several of these programs 
are summarized in this section.  
In developing the proposed rule, we carefully reviewed the existing reporting programs, 
particularly with respect to emissions sources covered, thresholds, monitoring methods, 
frequency of reporting and verification. States may have, or intend to develop, reporting 
programs that are broader in scope or are more aggressive in implementation because those 
2-8 

  
 
programs are either components of established reduction programs (e.g., cap and trade) or being 
used to design and inform specific complementary measures (e.g., energy efficiency). Where 
possible, we built upon concepts in existing Federal and State programs in developing the 
mandatory GHG reporting rule. 
2.4.1 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 
The U.S. greenhouse gas inventory, prepared by EPA’s Office of Atmospheric Programs
in coordination with the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, is an impartial, policy-neutral 
report that tracks annual GHG emissions. The annual report presents historical U.S. emissions of 
CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6. 
The United States submits the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks to 
the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as 
an annual reporting requirement. The UNFCCC treaty, ratified by the United States in 1992, sets 
an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the challenge posed by climate 
change. The United States has submitted the GHG inventory to the United Nations every year 
since 1993. The annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks is consistent with
national inventory data submitted by other UNFCCC parties, and uses internationally accepted 
methods for its emission estimates. 
In preparing the annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, EPA 
leads an interagency team that includes the Department of Energy (DOE), USDA, the 
Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Defense (DOD), the State Department, 
and others. EPA collaborates with hundreds of experts representing more than a dozen federal 
agencies, academic institutions, industry associations, consultants, and environmental 
organizations. The Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks is peer-reviewed 
annually by domestic experts and by UNFCCC, and undergoes a 30-day public comment period, 
and is peer reviewed annually by UNFCCC review teams. 
The Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks is a comprehensive, top-
down national assessment of national greenhouse gas emissions, and uses top-down national 
energy data and other national statistics (e.g., on agriculture). To achieve the goal of 
comprehensive national emissions coverage for reporting under the UNFCCC, most GHG 
emissions in the report are calculated via activity data from national-level databases, statistics, 
and surveys. The use of the aggregated national data means that the national emissions estimates 
are not broken down at the geographic or facility level. In contrast, this reporting rule focuses on 
bottom-up data and individual sources above appropriate thresholds. Although it will provide 
2-9 

 more specific data, it will not provide full coverage of total annual U.S. GHG emissions, as is 
required in the development of the Inventory in reporting to the UNFCCC. 
The mandatory GHG reporting rule will help to improve the development of future 
national inventories for particular source categories or sectors by advancing the understanding of 
emission processes and monitoring methodologies. Facility, unit, and process level GHG 
emissions data for industrial sources will improve the accuracy of the Inventory by confirming 
the national statistics and emission estimation methodologies used to develop the top-down 
inventory. The results can indicate shortcomings in the national statistics and identify where 
adjustments may be needed. 
Therefore, although the data collected under this rule will not replace the system in place 
to produce the comprehensive annual national Inventory, it can serve as a useful tool to better 
improve the accuracy of future national-level inventories. 
2.4.2 Federal Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Programs 
EPA and other federal agencies operate a number of voluntary GHG reporting and 
reduction programs that EPA reviewed when developing this proposal, including Climate 
Leaders, several non-CO2 voluntary programs, the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
partnership, the SmartWay Transport Partnership program, the National Environmental 
Performance Track Partnership, and the DOE 1605(b) voluntary GHG registry. Several other 
federal voluntary programs encourage emissions reductions, clean energy, or energy efficiency; 
this summary does not cover them all (for additional information see Review of Existing 
Programs, EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-054). This summary focuses on programs that include 
voluntary GHG emission inventories or reporting of GHG emissions reduction activities for 
sectors that were considered for inclusion in this rulemaking.  
2.4.2.1 Climate Leaders 
Climate Leaders is an EPA partnership program that works with companies to develop 
GHG reduction strategies. Over 250 industry partners in a wide range of sectors have joined this 
program. Partner companies complete a corporate-wide inventory of GHG emissions and 
develop an inventory management plan using Climate Leaders protocols. Each company sets 
GHG reductions goals and submits to EPA an annual GHG emissions inventory documenting 
their progress. The annual reporting form provides corporate-wide emissions by type of 
emissions source.  
2-10 

  
 
 
2.4.2.2 Non-CO2 Voluntary Partnership Programs 
Since the 1990s, EPA has operated a number of non-CO2 voluntary partnership programs
aimed at reducing emissions from GHGs such as methane, SF6, and PFCs. There are four sector-
specific voluntary methane reduction programs: Natural Gas STAR, Landfill Methane Outreach 
Partnership (LMOP), Coalbed Methane Outreach Programs (CMOP), and Ag STAR. In addition, 
there are sector-specific voluntary emissions reduction partnerships for high global warming 
potential gases. The Natural Gas STAR partnership encourages companies across the natural gas 
and oil industries to adopt practices that reduce methane emissions. LMOP and CMOP 
encourage voluntary capture and use landfill and coal mine methane, respectively, to generate 
electricity or other useful energy. These partnerships focus on achieving methane reductions. 
Industry partners voluntarily provide technical information on projects they undertake to reduce 
methane emissions on an annual basis, but they do not submit methane emissions inventories. 
AgSTAR encourages beneficial use of agricultural methane from manure management systems 
but does not have partner reporting requirements. 
There are two sector-specific partnerships to reduce SF6 emissions: the SF6 Emission 
Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems, with over 80 participating utilities, and the 
SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for the Magnesium Industry. Partners in these programs 
implement practices to reduce SF6 emissions and prepare corporate-wide annual inventories of 
SF6 emissions using protocols and reporting tools developed by EPA. There are also two 
partnerships focused on PFCs: The Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership (VAIP) promotes 
technically feasible and cost-effective actions to reduce PFC emissions; industry partners track 
and report PFC emissions reductions. Similarly, the Semiconductor Industry Association and 
EPA formed a partnership to reduce PFC emissions in which a third party compiles data from
participating semiconductor companies and submits an aggregate (not company-specific) annual 
PFC emissions report.  
2.4.2.3 Combined Heat and Power Partnership 
The Combined Heat and Power partnership is an EPA partnership that cuts across sectors. 
It encourages use of CHP technologies to generate electricity and heat from the same fuel source, 
thereby increasing energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions from fuel combustion. 
Corporate and institutional partners provide data on existing and new CHP projects but do not 
submit emissions inventories. 
2-11 

  
 
 
 
2.4.2.4 SmartWay Transport Partnership 
The SmartWay Transport Partnership program is a voluntary partnership between freight 
industry stakeholders and EPA to promote fuel efficiency improvements and GHG emissions 
reductions. Over 900 companies have joined including freight carriers (railroads and trucking 
fleets) and shipping companies. Carrier and shipping companies commit to measuring and 
improving the efficiency of their freight operations using EPA-developed tools that quantify the 
benefits of a number of fuel-saving strategies. Companies report progress annually. The GHG 
data that carrier companies report to EPA is discussed further in Section V.QQ.4b of the 
preamble. 
2.4.2.5 National Environmental Performace Track Partnership 
The Performance Track Partnership is a voluntary partnership that recognizes and 
rewards private and public facilities that demonstrate strong environmental performance beyond 
current requirements. Performance Track is designed to augment the existing regulatory system
by creating incentives for facilities to achieve environmental results beyond those required by 
law. To qualify, applicants must have implemented an independently-assessed environmental 
management system, have a record of sustained compliance with environmental laws and 
regulations, commit to achieving measurable environmental results that go beyond compliance, 
and provide information to the local community on their environmental activities. Members are 
subject to the same legal requirements as other regulated facilities. In some cases, EPA and states
have reduced routine reporting or given some flexibility to program members in how they meet 
regulatory requirements. This approach is recognized by more than 20 states that have adopted 
similar performance-based leadership programs. 
2.4.2.6 1605(b) Voluntary Registry 
The DOE EIA established a voluntary GHG registry under Section 1605(b) of the Energy 
Policy Act of 1992. The program was recently enhanced and a final rule containing general 
reporting guidelines was published on April 21, 2006 (71 FR 20784); the rule is contained in 10 
CFR Part 300. Unlike EPA’s proposal, which requires reporting of greenhouse emissions from
facilities over a specific threshold, the DOE 1605(b) registry allows anyone (e.g., a public entity, 
private company, or an individual) to report their emissions and their emissions reduction 
projects to the registry. Large emitters (e.g., anyone that emits over 10,000 tons of CO2e per 
year) who wish to register emissions reductions must submit annual company-wide GHG 
emissions inventories following technical guidelines published by DOE and must calculate and 
report net GHG emissions reductions. The program offers a range of reporting methodologies 
from stringent direct measurement to simplified calculations using default factors and allows the 
2-12 

                                                  
reporters to report using the methodological option they choose. In addition, as mentioned above, 
unlike EPA’s proposal, sequestration and offset projects can also be reported under the 1605(b) 
program. There is additional flexibility offered to small sources who can choose to limit annual 
inventories and emissions reduction reports to a single type of activity rather than reporting 
company-wide GHG emissions, but must still follow the technical guidelines. Reported data are 
made available on the Internet in a public use database. 
2.4.2.7 Summary 
These voluntary programs are different in nature from the proposed mandatory GHG 
emissions reporting rule. Industry participation in the programs and reporting to the programs is 
entirely voluntary. A small number of sources report, compared to the number of facilities that 
will likely be affected by the proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule. Most of the EPA 
voluntary programs do not require reporting of annual emissions data, but are instead intended to 
encourage GHG reduction activities and track partner’s successes in implementing such projects. 
For the programs that do include annual emissions reporting (e.g., Climate Leaders, DOE 
1605[b]) the scope and level of detail are different. For example, Climate Leaders’ annual reports 
are generally corporate-wide and do not contain the facility and process-level details that would 
be needed by a mandatory program to verify the accuracy of the emissions reports.  
At the same time, aspects of the voluntary programs serve as useful starting points for the 
mandatory GHG reporting rules. Greenhouse gas emission calculation principles and protocols 
have been developed for various types of emission sources by Climate Leaders, the DOE 
1605(b) program, and some partnerships such as the SF6 reduction partnerships and SmartWay. 
Under these protocols, reporting companies monitor process or operating parameters to estimate 
greenhouse emissions, report annually, and retain records to document their GHG estimates. 
Through the voluntary programs, EPA, DOE, and participating companies have gained 
understanding of processes that emit GHGs and experience in developing and reviewing GHG 
emission inventories. 
2.4.3 Federal Mandatory Reporting Programs 
2.4.3.1 Acid Rain Program  
The Acid Rain Program (ARP) and NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) are cap-and­
trade programs designed to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx5. As a part of those programs, 
facilities that serve a generator larger than 25 megawatts (MW) to report emissions. The 40 CFR 
5For more information about these cap and trade programs see http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/ 
2-13 

  
 
Part 75 continuous emissions monitoring rule establishes monitoring and reporting requirements 
under these programs. The regulations in 40 CFR part 70 require continuous monitoring and 
quarterly and annual emissions reporting of CO2 mass emissions, SO2 mass emissions, NOx 
emission rate, and heat input. Part 75 contains specifications for the types of monitoring systems 
that may be used to determine CO2 emissions and sets forth operations, maintenance, and quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) requirements for each system. In some cases, EGUs are 
allowed to use simplified procedures other than CEMS(e.g., monitoring fuel feed rates and 
conducting periodic sampling and analyses of fuel carbon content) to determine CO2 emissions. 
Under the regulations, affected EGUs must submit detailed quarterly and annual CO2 emissions 
reports using standardized electronic reporting formats. If CEMS are used, the quarterly reports 
include hourly CEMS data and other information used to calculate emissions (e.g., monitor 
downtime). If alternative monitoring programs are used, detailed data used to calculate CO2 
emissions must be reported. 
The joint explanatory statement accompanying the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations 
Amendment specified that EPA could use the existing reporting requirements for electric 
generating units under section 821 of the 1990 CAA Amendments. As described in Sections 
V.C. and V.D. of this preamble, because the part 75 regulations already require reporting of high 
quality CO2 data from EGUs, the GHG reporting rule proposes to use the same CO2 data rather 
than require additional reporting of CO2 from EGUs. They will, however, have to include 
reporting of the other GHG emissions, such as CH4 and N2O, at their facilities. 
2.4.3.2 Toxics Release Inventory 
TRI requires facility-level reporting of annual mass emissions of approximately 650 toxic 
chemicals. If they are above established thresholds, facilities in a wide range of industries report 
including manufacturing industries, metal and coal mining, electric utilities, and other industrial 
sectors. Facilities must submit annual reports of total stack and fugitive emissions of the listed 
toxic chemicals using a standardized form which can be submitted electronically. No information 
is reported on the processes and emissions points included in the total emissions. The data 
reported to TRI are not directly useful for the GHG rule because TRI does not include GHG 
emissions and does not identify processes or emissions sources. However, the TRI program is 
similar to the proposed GHG reporting rule in that it requires direct emissions reporting from a 
large number of facilities (roughly 23,000) across all major industrial sectors. Therefore, EPA 
reviewed the TRI program for ideas regarding program structure and implementation. 
2-14 

  
2.4.3.3 Vehicle Reporting 
EPA’s existing criteria pollutant emissions certification regulations, as well as the fuel 
economy testing regulations which EPA administers as part of the CAFE program, require 
vehicle manufacturers to measure and report CO2 for essentially all of their light duty vehicles. 
In addition, many engine manufacturers currently measure CO2 as an integral part of calculating 
emissions of criteria pollutants, and some report CO2 emissions to EPA in some form. 
2.4.4 Other EPA Emissions Inventories 
2.4.4.1 National Emissions Inventory 
EPA compiles the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), a database of air emissions 
information provided primarily by state and local air agencies and tribes. The database contains 
information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, 
as well as hazardous air pollutants. Stationary point source emissions that must be inventoried 
and reported are those that emit over a threshold amount of at least one criteria pollutant. Many 
states also inventory and report stationary sources that emit amounts below the thresholds for 
each pollutant. The point source NEI includes over 60,000 facilities. Required point source 
information consists of facility identification information; process information detailing the types 
of air pollution emission sources, air pollution emission estimates (including annual emissions), 
control devices in place, stack parameters, and location information. The NEI differs from the 
proposed GHG reporting rule in that the NEI contains no GHG data, and the data are reported 
primarily by State agencies rather than directly reported by industries . However, in developing 
the proposed rule, EPA used the NEI to help determine sources that might need to report under 
the GHG reporting rule. We considered the types of facility, process and activity data reported in 
NEI to support the emissions data as a possible model for the types of data to be reported under 
the GHG reporting rule. We also considered systems that could be used to link data reported 
under the GHG rule with data for the same facilities in the NEI.
2.4.5 State and Regional Voluntary Programs for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting  
A number of States have demonstrated leadership and developed corporate voluntary 
GHG reporting programs individually or joined with other States to develop GHG reporting 
programs as part of their approaches to addressing GHG emissions. This section of the preamble 
summarizes two prominent voluntary efforts. In developing the greenhouse rules, EPA reviewed 
the relevant protocols used by these programs as a starting point. We recognize that these 
programs may have additional monitoring and reporting requirements than those outlined in the 
proposed rule in order to provide distinct program benefits. 
2-15 

  
 
2.4.5.1 California Climate Action Registry
The California Climate Action Registry (CCAR) is a voluntary GHG registry already in 
use in California. CCAR has released several methodology documents, including a general 
reporting protocol, general certification (verification) protocol, and several sector-specific 
protocols. Companies submit emissions reports using a standardized electronic system. Emission 
reports may be aggregated at the company level or reported at the facility level. 
2.4.5.2 The Climate Registry 
The Climate Registry (TCR) is a partnership formed by U.S. and Mexican states, 
Canadian provinces, and tribes to develop standard GHG emissions measurement and 
verification protocols and reporting system capable of supporting mandatory or voluntary GHG 
emission reporting rules and policies for its member states. TCR has released a final General 
Reporting Protocol that contains procedures to measure and calculate GHG emissions from a 
wide range of source categories. They have also released a general verification protocol, and an 
electronic reporting system. Founding reporters (companies and other organizations that have 
agreed to voluntarily report their GHG emissions) implemented a pilot reporting program in 
2008. Annual reports will be submitted covering six GHGs. Corporations must report facility-
specific emissions broken out by type of emission source (e.g., stationary combustion, electricity 
use, direct process emissions) within the facility.  
2.4.6 	 State and Regional Mandatory Programs for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting 
and Control 
Several individual States and regional groups of States have demonstrated leadership and 
are developing or have developed mandatory GHG reporting programs and GHG emissions 
control programs. This section of the preamble summarizes two regional cap-and-trade programs 
and several State mandatory reporting rules. We recognize that, like the current voluntary 
regional and State programs, State and regional mandatory reporting programs may evolve or 
develop to include additional monitoring and reporting requirements than those included in the 
proposed rule. In fact, these programs may be broader in scope or more aggressive in 
implementation because the programs are either components of established reduction programs 
(e.g., cap and trade) or being used to design and inform specific complementary measures (e.g., 
energy efficiency). 
2.4.6.1 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a regional cap-and-trade program that 
covers CO2 emissions from EGUs larger than 25 MW in member states in the Mid-Atlantic and 
2-16 

  
 
 
 
                                                 
 
Northeast. The program goal is to reduce CO2 emissions to 10% below 1990 levels by the year 
2020. RGGI will utilize the CO2 reported to and QA/QCed by EPA under 40 CFR Part 75 to 
determine compliance of the EGUs in the cap-and-trade program. In addition, the EGUs in RGGI 
that are not currently reporting to EPA under the Acid Rain and NOx Budget programs (e.g., co­
generation facilities) will start reporting their CO2 data to EPA for QA/QC, similar to the sources 
already reporting. Certain types of offset projects will be allowed, and GHG offset protocols 
have been developed. The states participating in RGGI have adopted state rules (based on a 
model rule) to implement RGGI in each state. The RGGI cap-and-trade program took effect on 
January 1, 2009. 
2.4.6.2 Western Climate Initiative 
WCI is another regional cap-and-trade program being developed by a group of Western 
States and Canadian provinces. The goal is to reduce GHG emissions to 15 percent below 2005 
levels by the year 2020. Draft options papers and program scope papers were released in early 
2008, public comments were reviewed, and final program design recommendations were made in 
September 2008. Other elements of the program, such as reporting requirements, market 
operations, and offset program development continues. Several source categories are being 
considered for inclusion in the cap and trade framework. The program might be phased in, 
starting with a few source categories and adding others over time. Points of regulation for some
source categories, calculation methodologies, and other reporting program elements are under 
development. The WCI is also analyzing alternative or complementary policies other than cap­
and-trade that could help reach GHG reduction goals. Options for rule implementation and for 
coordination with other rules and programs such as TCR are being investigated.  
2.4.7 State Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rules 
Seventeen states have developed, or are developing, mandatory GHG reporting rules.6 
The docket for this rule contains a summary of these state mandatory rules (EPA-HQ-OAR­
2008-0508-056). Final rules have not yet been developed by some of the states, so details of 
some programs are unknown. Reporting requirements have already effect in twelve states as of 
2009; the rest will begin between 2010 and 2012. Reporting is typically annual, although some
states require quarterly reporting for EGUs, consistent with RGGI and ARP.  
State rules differ with regard to which facilities must report and which GHGs must be
reported. Some states require all facilities that must obtain Title V permits to report GHG 
6These are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
2-17 

  
 
 
 
 
emissions. Others require reporting for particular sectors (e.g., large EGUs, cement plants, 
refineries). Some state rules apply to any facility with stationary combustion sources that emit a 
threshold level of CO2. Some apply to any facility, or to facilities within listed industries, if their 
emissions exceed a specified threshold level of CO2e. Many of the state rules apply to six GHGs 
covered by this proposed rule (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs, SF6); others apply 
only to CO2 or a subset of the six gases. Most require reporting at the facility level, or by unit or 
process within a facility. 
The level of specificity regarding GHG monitoring and calculation methods varies. Some
of the states refer to use of protocols established by TCR or CCAR, to industry-specific protocols 
(such as methods developed by the American Petroleum Institute [API]), to accepted
international methodologies such as IPCC, and/or to emission factors in EPA’s Compilation of

2.1.7.1 California Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule 
The mandatory reporting rule of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is an 
example of a state rule that covers multiple source categories and contains relatively detailed 
requirements, similar to this proposal developed by EPA. According to the CARB proposed rule 
(originally proposed October 19, 2007, and revised on December 5, 2007), monitoring must 
begin on January 1, 2009, and the first reports will be submitted in 2010. The rule requires 
facility-level reporting of all GHGs (except PFCs) from cement manufacturing plants, electric 
power generation and retail markets, cogeneration plants, petroleum refineries, hydrogen plants, 
and facilities with stationary combustion sources emitting greater than 25,000 tons CO2 per year. 
Part 75 (ARP) data will be used for EGUs. The CARB rule contains specific GHG estimation 
methods that are largely consistent with CCAR protocols, and also rely on API protocols and 
IPCC/European Union protocols for certain types of sources. California continues to participate 
in other national and regional efforts, such as TCR and WCI, to assist with developing consistent 
reporting tools and procedures on a national and regional basis.

SECTION 3 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED MANDATORY REPORTING RULE 
To develop the Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule, EPA considered various dimensions of 
the reporting program and developed and evaluated several options for each dimension. After a 
preliminary evaluation of the options for each dimension, a recommended reporting program
alternative was selected. Several possible program alternatives were selected, generally by 
varying one dimension at a time, while retaining the recommended option for the other 
dimensions. These alternatives were then evaluated based on estimated cost, cost-effectiveness 
(cost per ton of emissions reported), and estimated impacts on small entities. This process is 
discussed in greater detail below. 
3.1 Rule Dimensions for Which Options Were Identified 
Possible designs for the Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule were developed by varying 
options across four dimensions: 
1. 	 Thresholds: In the language of the appropriations bill that calls for the development 
of the reporting rule, the EPA Administrator is called upon to identify “appropriate 
thresholds” above which facilities are required to report their GHG emissions. 
Thresholds may be based on production or productive capacity, or they may be based 
on emissions. 
2. 	 Measurement Methodology: To be able to report their GHG emissions, facilities 
will be required to measure them using an appropriate methodology. Generally, 
measurement methodologies may be based on instrumentation and direct 
measurement, or on calculation of measurements based on other data available to the 
facility (e.g., activity data and emissions factors). 
3. 	 Reporting Frequency: Reporting frequency may be annual, quarterly, or monthly.  
4. 	 Verification: For QA/QC purposes, a facility’s reported emissions of GHG could be 
verified, either by the Agency receiving the report (EPA, in this case), or by a third 
party, or reported emissions could be self-certified by the reporter without 
independent verification. 
The options EPA considered for each dimension are discussed below and summarized in 
Table 3-1. 
3.1.1 Thresholds 
Three options were considered in setting the threshold above which reporting of GHG 
emissions will be required: capacity-based thresholds, emissions-based thresholds, or a hybrid of 
the two. Within each option, various definitions and levels of the threshold were examined.

Table 3-1. Options Considered in Developing Scenarios (Recommended Option Indicated 
by Shading) 
Threshold Methodology Frequency Verification 
Capacity-based Direct measurement (CEMS) Quarterly for all EPA verifies 
Emissions based 1,000t CO2e Hybrid: Direct measurement Annual for all except Third-party verifier 
for facilities already quarterly for facilities 
reporting and facility-specific already reporting 
calculations for others quarterly
Emissions-based 10,000 Default emissions factors
tCO2e from EPA 
Emissions-based 25,000 Existing federal data used for 
tCO2e measurement of fuel 
suppliers 
Emissions-based 100,000
tCO2e 
Hybrid: 25,000 tCO2e unless 
already reporting based on
capacity under another
program
Only upstream sources report
emissions 
Option 1: Capacity-based threshold 
A capacity-based threshold would be defined based on the emitting facility’s throughput, 
production, or productive capacity. In defining the capacity-based threshold, EPA considered 
that using a source-level capacity measure for the threshold might be a more straightforward way 
for facilities to know that they must report their GHG emissions, but the data on source-level 
capacity is not currently universally available to EPA. 
Option 2: Emissions-based threshold 
Option 2 involves the use of actual facility-level emissions of GHGs, measured in metric 
tons of CO2-equivalent emissions (tCO2e). Various levels were considered, ranging from 1,000 
tCO2e to 100,000 tCO2e. Obviously, lower thresholds would require more sources to participate 
in the reporting program. The emissions threshold was analyzed for upstream producers as well. 
In those cases the analyses were done on the quantity of emissions that would occur when the 
fuel supplied was combusted or the chemicals supplied were used or released to the atmosphere 
at the end of life of the product. An emissions based threshold was not considered for 
manufacturers of motor vehicles and engines due to current reporting requirements that require 
manufacturers to report in terms of an emissions rate. Given current data availability, an 
3-2 

  
emissions-based threshold will generally focus on larger, emissions-intensive industries for 
which emissions data are readily calculated or measured.  
Option 3: Hybrid (recommended)
The hybrid threshold option is a combination of three general groups: capacity, 
emissions, or entire source category (“All in”). The thresholds developed are generally 
equivalent to a facility-wide threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2e per year of actual 
emissions. The preference is to establish thresholds for as many source categories as possible 
based on a capacity metric, for example, tons of product produced per year. A capacity-based 
threshold is least burdensome, because a facility would not have to estimate emissions to 
determine if the rule applies. However, EPA faces two key challenges in trying to develop 
capacity thresholds. First, in most cases, data are insufficient to determine an appropriate 
capacity threshold. Secondly, for some source categories, defining the appropriate capacity 
metric is infeasible. For example, for some source categories, GHG emissions are not related to 
production capacity, but are more affected by design and operating factors. 
3.1.2 Measurement Methodology 
EPA identified three measurement methodology options, ranging from installing 
emissions monitoring equipment on all sources to using default emissions factors to estimate 
emissions. The measurement methodology options are discussed below.  
All sources required to report under this rule will also be required to report electricity 
usage data. This will provide a better understanding of how electricity is used in the economy 
and the major industrial sectors. The rule would not provide for adjustments to take into account 
the purchases of renewable energy credits or other mechanisms. Monitoring of electricity use is 
accomplished through accounting of kilowatt hours billed for on utility statements. 
Option 1: Direct measurement for all reporters 
This option would apply direct measurement requirements to all reporters. This would 
require facilities to use continuous emissions monitoring systems in the stacks from stationary 
combustion units and industrial for solid fuel and processes emissions, continuous measurement 
of solid fuel use (or solid fuel production for upstream producers), and fuel flow meters for 
liquid and gaseous fuels and for upstream producers.  
3-3 

  
  
 
 
Option 2: Hybrid of direct measurement where already used and facility-specific calculation for 
other sources (recommended)
EPA’s recommended measurement methodology option would require direct 
measurement of emissions from units at facilities that already are required to collect and report 
data using CEMS under other Federally enforceable programs (e.g., ARP, NSPS, NESHAP, 
SIPs). facilities to use direct measurement of emissions where facilities are already using CEMS 
(e.g., ARP) andFacilities with units that do not have CEMS installed could calculate emissions 
using facility-specific information and methods specified in the rule. 
Option 3: Default emissions factor calculation for both combustion and process emissions 
Under Option 3, EPA would require facilities to base their reported emissions on 
simplified calculations performed at the facility level, based on EPA-provided default factors 
combined with the type of fuel combusted, the type of process, production rate, and/or the 
quantity of fuel/chemical inputs used.  
3.1.3 Reporting Frequency 
EPA identified two options for reporting frequency: quarterly reports or annual reports. 
To minimize costs, EPA recommends annual reports, except for those facilities already reporting 
quarterly under another program. 
Option 1: Quarterly 
Under Option 1, all reporters would be required to submit their emissions data quarterly. 
Option 2: Annually (recommended)
Under Option 2, EPA would require all reporters to submit their emissions data annually, 
except for those facilities already reporting data quarterly to the Energy Information 
Administration or for existing mandatory reporting programs, such as ARP or the Mine Safety 
and Health Administration (MSHA) program. 
3.1.4 Verification
For QA/QC purposes, facility emissions reports could be verified by an outside entity, 
whether the government or a private third party. A third option is self-certification by the 
reporter without any independent verification. 
Option 1: EPA as verifier (recommended)
Under this option, the reporter submits and self-certifies emissions data and other 
specified activity data directly to EPA., and EPA would review the emissions estimates and the 
3-4 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
supporting data contained in the reports, and perform other activities (e.g., comparison of data 
across similar facilities, site visits) to verify that the reported emissions data are accurate and 
completeperform the QA/QC checks using the submitted information. This is the approach used 
for verification under ARP and a number of other EPA and federal programs. 
Option 2: Third-party verifier 
Under this option, the reporter would self-certify their emissions data and also hire a 
private firm to verify their data and estimation methods prior to submitting the emissions data to 
EPA. The private firm would likely be required to be selected from a list of such firms that have
been pre-certified by EPA. This third-party verification is similar to the approach used for the 
California mandatory reporting rule and the Climate Registry.
3.2 Recommended Options 
As described above, EPA evaluated a variety of options for each dimension of the 
proposed GHG reporting program, and selected a preferred or recommended option for each 
dimension. Table 3-1 illustrates the options examined under each dimension, and shows the 
recommended option by shading. We summarize the recommended option for each dimension 
below. 
 Threshold: Hybrid approach 
– 	 A facility that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e/year or more reports all sources for 
which there are methods.  
– 	 The thresholds fall generally into three groups: capacity, emissions, or entire 
source category (“All in”). The capacity and “all-in” thresholds are roughly 
equivalent to 25,000 metric tons CO2e/year. 
– 	 A facility may be subject to a capacity threshold when already reporting (e.g., 
ARP) or to another type of threshold due to unique issues or where an emissions-
based threshold is not practical (e.g., GHG generation threshold for landfills). 
 Measurement Methodology: Hybrid approach, with source-specific methodologies 
– 	 A facility must use direct measurement of stationary combustion and some 
process sources where CEMS are currently installed and the facility is required to 
collect and report data using CEMS under other Federally enforceable programs
(e.g., ARP, NSPS, NESHAP, SIPs).
– 	 A facility must use source-specific calculation methods contained in the rule and 
site-specific data to calculate emissions fromfor other sources at the facility. 
 Reporting Frequency: Annual 
– 	 All reporters would report their emissions annually. 
3-5 

  
– 	 An exception exists for those already reporting quarterly for existing mandatory 
programs (e.g., ARP, MSHA, EIA). 
 Verification: Self-certification with EPA verification 
– 	 A facility would report emissions data and supporting information directly to 
EPA; EPA will use the information to verify the data. 
3.3 Alternative Scenarios Evaluated 
EPA developed alternative reporting scenarios and assessed the costs and emissions 
associated with each. Alternative scenarios were developed by creating the recommended 
scenario (the recommended option for each dimension, as shown in Table 3-1), then varying the 
levels in one dimension while keeping the other three dimensions at the recommended options. 
The alternative reporting scenarios evaluated are listed below: 
1. 	 A 1,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
2. 	 A 10,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
3. 	 A 100,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
4. 	 Direct techniques (CEMS, flow meters) are used to measure emissions; recommended 
option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
5. 	 Default emissions factors (simplified methods) are used to measure emissions; 
recommended option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
6. 	 Existing federal data used for measurement of fuel suppliers; recommended option 
for threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources.  
7. 	 EPA uses default carbon content for fuel suppliers; recommended option for 
threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources. 
8. 	 Reporting is quarterly; recommended option for threshold, methodology, and verifier. 
9. 	 Verification is done by a third party; recommended option for threshold, 
methodology, and frequency. 
10. Only upstream sources report emissions; recommended option for methodology, 
frequency, and verifier. 
The evaluation of the alternative reporting scenarios will allow policy makers to see the impact 
of each variation and assess their cost compared to the recommended option. Total costs, 
emissions, and cost-effectiveness of the alternative reporting scenarios are discussed in 
Section 4. Additionally, Section 5 provides a qualitative exploration of the effect on emissions 
coverage and total cost by moving to substantially lower thresholds such as 100 or 250 tCO2e.

3.4 Data Quality for this Analysis 
For this analysis, EPA gathered existing data from EPA, industry trade associations, 
states, and publicly available data sources (e.g., labor rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
[BLS]) to characterize the processes, sources, sectors, facilities, and companies/entities affected. 
Costs were estimated based on the data collected and engineering analysis and models provided 
by EPA and its contractors. EPA staff and contractors provided engineering expertise, 
knowledge of existing facility conditions and activities (e.g., whether CO2 or non-CO2 CEMS 
were already in use for combustion sources in specific sectors, typical labor hours required for 
developing QA plans and performing fuel sampling), and an estimate of incremental activities 
required to comply with the rule. Existing models, such as EPA’s CEMS cost model, were used 
across sectors to ensure consistency of cost inputs and assumptions. 
The most important elements affecting the data quality for this analysis include the 
number of affected facilities in each source category, the number and types of combustion units 
at each facility, the number and types of production processes that emit GHGs, process inputs 
and outputs (especially for monitoring procedures that involve a carbon mass balance), and the 
measurements that are already being made for reasons not associated with the proposed rule (to 
allow only the incremental costs to be estimated). Many of the affected sources categories, 
especially those that are the largest emitters of GHGs (e.g., electric utilities, industrial boilers, 
petroleum refineries, cement plants, iron and steel production, pulp and paper) are subject to 
national emission standards. In the development of those national standards, detailed background 
information was gathered to characterize the industry (e.g., number of facilities, types of 
processes, capacity), and this information was a valuable source of high quality data. The 
background information for standards development, often collected from industry surveys, was 
supplemented from numerous sources, including industry surveys from the U.S. Census Bureau, 
trade associations, and operating permits, for example. Information on measurements that are 
already made (and thus would not be associated with the proposed rule) was obtained from
discussions with industry representatives, knowledge gained from previous site visits, and other 
sources. The data collected to characterize the facilities in the various source categories are 
judged to be of good quality and the best that is publicly available. 
Other elements affecting the quality of the data include estimates of labor hours to 
perform specific activities, cost of labor, and cost of monitoring equipment. Estimates of labor 
hours were based on previous analyses of the costs of monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping 
for other rules; information from the industry characterization on the number of units or process 
inputs and outputs to be monitored, and engineering judgment. Labor costs were taken from the 
3-7 

  
BLS and adjusted to account for overhead. Monitoring costs were generally based on cost 
algorithms or approaches that had been previously developed, reviewed, accepted as adequate, 
and used specifically to estimate the costs associated with various types of measurements and 
monitoring. The data quality associated with these elements of the cost analysis is analogous to 
the quality of data used in the development of numerous other Information Collection Requests 
for the different industrial source categories.

SECTION 4 

ENGINEERING COST ANALYSIS 

4.1 Introduction 
EPA estimated costs of complying with the proposed rule for process emissions of GHGs 
in each affected industrial facility, as well as emissions from stationary combustion sources at 
industrial facilities and other facilities, and emissions of GHGs from mobile sources. EPA used 
available industry and EPA data to characterize conditions at affected sources. Incremental 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting activities were then identified for each type of facility, 
and the associated costs were estimated. We present the reporting and verification requirements 
by source categories in Table 4-1.

Note: Many facilities that would be affected by the proposed rule emit GHGs from multiple sources. The facility 
must assess every source category that could potentially apply to each when determining if a threshold has been
exceeded. If the threshold is exceed for any source category, the facility must report emissions from all source 
categories, including those source categories that do not exceed the applicable threshold. 
4.2 Overview of Cost Analysis 
The costs of complying with the proposed rule will vary from one facility to another, 
depending on the types of emissions, the number of affected sources at the facility, existing 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting activities at the facility, etc. The costs include labor 
4-15 

  
costs for performing the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting activities necessary to comply 
with the proposed rule. For some affected facilities, costs include monitoring, recording, and 
reporting of GHG emissions from production processes and from stationary combustion units. 
For other facilities, the only emissions of GHGs are from stationary combustion. All costs 
referred to in this section are reported in 2006 dollars.  
For each source category, we first provide a general overview of baseline reporting (if 
data are available); two costs components associated with this information collection; labor costs 
(i.e., the cost of labor by facility staff to meet the information collection requirements of the 
proposed rule); and capital and operating and maintenance costs (e.g., the cost of purchasing and 
installing monitoring equipment or contractor costs associated with providing the required 
information). Additional details of the data, methods, and assumptions underlying the costs are 
documented in a separate cost appendix and in accompanying Technical Support Documents 
(TSDs). The TSDs also include information on the assumptions and methods used to identify 
representative entities or groups of entities used to develop the cost analysis for each subpart. 
4.2.1 Baseline Reporting 
When data are available to determine how many companies are currently implementing 
approaches consistent with the proposed methods at the facility level to meet internal GHG 
management programs or state or voluntary reporting programs at the domestic or international 
level, we include a discussion of the baseline reporting practices. When data are not available, 
we are assuming that none of the facilities in these source categories are currently reporting 
emissions and that many of the proposed requirements will result in “new” or “full” costs to meet 
reporting requirements. Specifically, we are assuming that there will be additional costs for any 
sampling and testing in the requirements in proposed methods (i.e., carbon contents of process 
inputs, such coke, coal, carbonate composition, or actual emissions). We are also assuming that 
additional costs will be incurred for preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, performing the 
calculations, reporting the results, and maintaining records. The only significant element for 
these sources that we know is performed routinely by all companies is that they have
measurements and records of consumption of raw materials such as feedstocks, carbonates, and 
reducing agents as part of their routine operation for accounting purposes. 
4.2.2 Reporting Costs 
To ensure consistency in the development of cost estimates across all sources, EPA 
developed a cost spreadsheet template that each subpart used to compile, document, and 
calculate per unit reporting costs. Please refer back to Section 3 for information on the subpart 
4-16 

  
 
 
 
  
                                                 
 
     
process for source categories. Detailed instructions were provided along with the cost 
spreadsheet template that clearly explained the data to be compiled and calculated. The template 
included three tables; analysis of reporting thresholds, analysis of monitoring and reporting 
options, and unit costs for monitoring and reporting. Key variables and data fields were clearly 
defined to ensure that each sub group developed costs around a standard set of methods and 
assumptions (e.g., method for annualization of capital costs, interest rate to be applied to capital). 
Labor Costs. The costs of complying with and administering this proposed rule include 
the time of managers, technical, and administrative staff in both the private sector and the public 
sector. Staff hours are estimated for activities including 
 monitoring (private): staff hours to operate and maintain emissions monitoring 
systems; 
 reporting (private): staff hours to gather and process available data and reporting it to 
EPA through electronic systems; and 
 assuring and releasing data (public): staff hours to quality assure, analyze, and release 
reports. 
Staff activities and associated labor costs may vary over time. Thus, cost estimates are 
developed for start-up, first-time reporting, and subsequent reporting. 
Loaded hourly labor rates (also referred to as “wage rates”) were developed for several 
labor categories to represent the employer costs to use an hour of employees’ time in each of the 
manufacturing sector labor categories used in this analysis. The labor categories correspond to 
the job responsibilities of the personnel that are likely to be involved in GHG emissions 
monitoring activities at the manufacturing facility level to comply with the rulemaking.  
For purposes of this study, EPA adopted the methodology used by Cody Rice (2002) to 
calculate the wage rates for the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program. Thus, the wage 
rates calculated for different labor categories included the employer costs for employee 
compensation (comprising the basic wages and the corresponding benefits) and the overhead 
costs to the employer.7 
For each labor category, the following formula was used to calculate the wage rates: 
7For each employee, the employer also incurs overhead costs (comprising the rental costs of the office space, 
computer hardware and software, telecommunication and other equipments, organizational support, etc.) 
required for and used by the employee to effectively fulfill his/her job responsibilities. These costs are over and
above the employee compensation costs. 
4-17 

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loaded Hourly Labor Rate ($/hr.) = Basic Wages ($/hr.) * (1 + Benefits Loading Factor +  

Overhead Loading Factor).
 
The benefits loading factor corresponds to the relative share of benefits compensation in 
the total employee compensation (comprising basic wages and benefits). Although the benefits 
factor tends to vary by labor category and by industry (0.37 to 0.50), for purposes of this 
analysis, we have assumed the benefits loading factor to remain the same for each labor category 
across all industries within the manufacturing sector due to a lack of availability of necessary 
industry-specific data on benefits paid to employees. 
The overhead loading factor corresponds to the share of overhead costs to the employer 
relative to the total employee compensation. For purposes of this analysis, we have also adopted 
the same overhead loading factor that Cody Rice (2002) used in her wage rate calculations. Thus 
the overhead loading factor that we used in the wage rate calculations remains the same for all 
labor categories and across all industry types within the manufacturing sector. The overhead 
loading factor was assumed to be 0.17.  
The loaded labor rates for eight labor categories are used in the analysis and are also 
reported in the appropriate sectors labor cost tables in the following sections. They include 
 electricity manager: $88.79; 
 refinery manager: $101.31; 
 industrial manager: $71.03; 
 lawyer: $101.00; 
 electricity engineer/technician: $60.84; 
 refinery engineer/technician: $63.89; 
 industrial engineer/technician: $55.20; and 
 administrative support: $29.65. 
Capital and O&M Costs. This includes the cost of purchasing and installing monitoring 
equipment or contractor costs associated with providing the required information. Selected 
subparts do not require capital expenditures because the selected monitoring option does not 
require capital equipment or the reporter already owns the necessary monitoring equipment. 
Equipment costs include both the initial purchase price of monitoring equipment and any 
facility/process modification that may be required. For example, the cost estimation method for 
mobile sources involves upstream measurement by the vehicle manufacturers. This may require 
4-18 

  
 
an upgrade to their test equipment and facility. Based on expert judgment, the engineering costs 
analyses annualized capital equipment costs with the appropriate lifetime and interest rate 
assumptions. Cost recovery periods vary by industry (5 to 15 years) with one-time capital costs 
are amortized at a rate of 7%.  
Although not proposed, costs of electricity purchase reporting are included in RIA to 
demonstrate the cost of this provision on which comment is requested. We estimate the annual 
cost of this provision if included to be only $376,000, which results in a slight overestimate of 
costs for the actual proposal. Under this provision, if included in the final rule, all sources 
required to report under this rule would also be required to report electricity purchase data. This 
will provide a better understanding of how electricity is used in the economy and the major 
industrial sectors. Monitoring of electricity purchases is accomplished through accounting of 
kilowatt hours billed for on utility statements. It was assumed that 1 hour of engineer/technician­
level time was required per year for each entity to report their electricity use at a cost of $29.65 
per hour. Additional recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs were also 
added to the majority of sectors.  
A potentially large number of facilities would need to calculate their emissions in order to 
determine whether or not they had to report under the proposed rule. Therefore, to further 
minimize the burden on those facilities, we are proposing that any facility that has an aggregate 
maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units less than 30 
mmBtu/hr may presume it has emissions below the threshold. According to our analysis, a 
facility with stationary combustion units that have a maximum rated heat input capacity of less 
than 30 mmBtu/hr, operating full time (e.g., 8,760 hours per year) with all types of fossil fuel 
would not exceed 25,000 metric tons CO2e/yr (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-049). Under this 
approach, we estimate that 30,000 facilities will have to assess whether or not they have to report 
based on stationary combustion activities. Of the 30,000, approximately 13,000 facilities would 
likely meet the threshold and have to report.  Therefore, an additional 17,000 facilities may have 
to assess their applicability but potentially not meet the threshold for reporting. The proposed 
rule requires facilities to follow methodologies in the rule to make a determination. It is assumed 
that a facility would utilize a fuel sampling methodology. The costs for this activity are outlined 
below: 
 Planning costs assumed to include: 
– 2 hours (industrial engineer/technician) for regulatory review 
– 4 hours (industrial engineer/technician) to resolve questions  
4-19 

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
– 4 hours (industrial engineer/technician) to develop sampling approach 
 Recordkeeping and reporting costs assumed to include: 
– 2 hours (industrial engineer/technician) for data reduction and review 
 Fuel sampling costs assume 1 hour (industrial engineer/technician) and $150 lab cost 
per sample. 
Using the labor costs presented in Section 4.2.2 (industrial engineer/technician—$55.20/hr) the 
total cost of the determination activity would be $867.60 per facility. These costs would be for a 
one-time fuel sampling and are based on the costs for monthly fuel sampling outlined in Section 
4.3. We are soliciting comment and gathering information on an alternative means of reporting 
determination that would provide simplified emissions calculation tools for certain source 
categories. The use of such tools could reduce the cost of the determination activity. The total 
cost of determination for these 17,000 facilities estimated to be below the selected threshold is 
not included in the total cost of the rule presented in this RIA.  
4.2.3 	 Cost Analysis Summary by Subpart 
At the end of this Section 4, we summarize the total facilities covered, emissions covered, 
and the cost information for each subpart. The data are the basis for the economic impact 
analysis described in detail in Section 5 of this document. This chapter provides these data, as 
well as background information needed to understand the engineering costs analysis conducted 
for each source and the reporting option selection.
4.3 	 Subpart C—General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources & Subpart D— 
Electricity Generation and other Stationary Combustion Sources 
Stationary combustion sources include stationary fossil fuel combustion units producing 
GHG emissions. Stationary combustion units include electricity generating units, boilers, 
furnaces, turbines, and kilns, among others. Costs for monitoring GHG emissions from stationary 
combustion sources were developed for several monitoring categories, listed in Table 4-2. Due to 
the methodological approaches taken, separate costing analyses were performed for monitoring 
methods for combustion-related CO2 emissions and monitoring methods for non-CO2 emissions 
(e.g., CH4 and N2O). For combustion-related non-CO2 emissions, EPA will use IPCC default 
emissions factors. These factors will be applied based on the fuel type used, thus there is minimal 
cost to reporters for combustion-related non-CO2 emissions. 
4-20 

  
 
For costing purposes, the monitoring categories for CO2 were divided into those that 
required the installation of new stack monitoring equipment (namely CEMS) and those that 
relied on analysis of fuels that are combusted. For the stack monitoring categories, different costs 
were assumed based on existing configurations of CEMS equipment. 
A range of data sources were used to develop these per unit cost estimates. These datasets 
include information currently collected by EPA under existing programs and other proprietary 
databases. 
For estimating costs for units within the electricity generation sector, data currently 
collected under the Acid Rain Program was used. The data includes both fuel usage and CEMS 
equipment installed. Additionally, EPA’s EGrid database of electricity generation in the United 
States contained information on facilities that are not reporting to the Acid Rain Program. The 
majority of those data are provided to EGrid from DOE’s Energy Information Administration 
(EIA) survey forms. The database Velocity Suite® (Ventyx, 2008) was also used to cross-
reference these information sources.
For units in industrial sectors, the primary sources of data on individual units were EPA 
analyses on certain industrial sectors, and a characterization of the U.S. boiler population. 
Information on existing CEMS was collected from data already reported to EPA’s NOx Budget 
Trading Program. An overall examination of the fuels used in the industrial sector was 
performed using data from EIA’s 2002 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS). 
For large emitters in the commercial sector, EIA’s 2003 Commercial Building Energy 
Consumption Survey (CBECS) was referenced, as well as EEA’s Characterization of the U.S. 
Industrial Commercial Boiler Population.  
From these datasets, the appropriate information on the fuel being used at facilities was 
gathered. Foremost, data was collected that allowed the determination to be made on whether a 
solid fuel was being combusted at a large stationary combustion unit. In the event that a solid 
fuel was combusted by such a large unit, additional details were available to understand existing 
CEMS equipment and the appropriate upgrade costs to meet the requirements being proposed in 
this rule. For those facilities that combusted natural gas or petroleum fuels, only a fuel analysis is 
required, and the appropriate costing scenario was then applied. 
4.3.1 Labor Costs 
Both first year and annual labor costs were constructed by estimating the number of staff 
hours required to perform the activities and multiplying them by the relevant wage rate. Wage 
rates to monetize staff time were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wage rates for 
4-21 

 other various labor categories (e.g., manager, environmental engineer, engineering technician, 
administrative support) were used as appropriate. A detailed breakdown of labor costs and other 
costs for each monitoring category is provided in Table 4-2. Additional cost details for each 
monitoring category are included in Tables 4-2a to 4-2i. These tables describe the 
requirements/activities for each category and show the labor hours and costs, consultant costs, 
and other direct costs (ODCs). 
4.3.2 Capital and O&M Costs 
In addition to labor costs, some firms must also purchase equipment in order to comply 
with the proposed rule. Equipment purchase costs are upfront costs, frequently paid for over a 
period of time. Therefore, these costs are annualized costs over a 15-year timeframe (which 
corresponds to the expected lifetime of the equipment) and discounted at a rate of 7%. Firms 
complying with the proposed rule will incur O&M costs each year. These costs can be separated 
into a labor component, accounted for in the above discussion of labor costs, and other direct

4.3.3 Units Covered 
The number of units estimated to report at the 1,000, 10,000, 25,000 hybrid, and 100,000 
ton thresholds are reported in Table 4-3. The unit counts reported in this table cover all subparts 
of the reporting program with the exception of Subpart H—cement production, Subpart Y— 
petroleum refineries, and Subpart Q—iron and steel production. In these cases, the engineering 
workgroups directly estimated labor, capital, and O&M costs associated with monitoring 
stationary fossil fuel combustion units producing GHG emissions. All estimates were generated 
using many of the above mentioned industry-specific databases, as well as expert judgment by 
industry experts and EPA.  
4.4 Subpart E—Adipic Acid Production 
Overview. Costs were developed for the following proposed monitoring method for 
estimating N2O emissions from adipic acid production.  
Labor Costs. A majority of the labor costs are associated with planning ($1,800) and 
sampling and analysis activities ($2,300). These costs cover process emissions. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $2,500 of O&M costs related to equipment, 
performance testing, and travel. These costs cover process emissions.

4.5 Subpart F—Aluminum Production 
Overview. Aluminum production capacities at U.S. primary production facilities are 
generally comparable (low hundreds of thousands of metric tons). Costs were therefore 
developed for a single model facility based on reported average labor burdens and annualized 
average non-labor costs (Table 4-6 and Table 4-7). 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $19,700; a majority of the costs are associated with 
sampling and analysis activities performed by an industrial engineer/technician ($17,700).  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $600 of sampling O&M costs. These costs cover 
process emissions.  
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) costs.

4.6 	 Subpart G—Ammonia Manufacturing 
Baseline Reporting. We do not know how many ammonia manufacturing companies are 
estimating and reporting emissions at the facility level to meet internal GHG management 
programs or state or voluntary reporting programs at the domestic or international level. We are 
assuming that no ammonia manufacturing facilities are currently reporting emissions and that 
many of the proposed requirements will result in “new” or “full” costs to meet reporting 
requirements.  
We are assuming that the proposed requirements will result in “full” costs primarily to 
meet EPA’s reporting requirements. Specifically, we assume that additional costs will be 
incurred for preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, sampling and analysis of feedstock for 
carbon content, performing the calculations, reporting the results, and maintaining records. The 
only significant element of the approach that we know is performed routinely by all companies is 
that they have measurements and records of fuel and feedstock consumed as part of their routine 
operation for accounting purposes. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. The selected option requires continuous measurement of fuel; 
internal development of the methodology and monitoring plan for calculating emissions from
production process; managers’ reviews of samples per sampling period; contacting supplier to 
get the carbon content of the reducing agent; and QA/QC of supplier information on carbon 
content of the reducing agent. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $3,300 in the first year and $2,100 in subsequent years; 
a majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis activities performed by an 
industrial engineer/technician (approximately $2,400 in the first year and $1,300 in subsequent 
years). 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $800 of sampling O&M costs.

4.7 	Subpart H—Cement Production 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as EPA’s Climate 
Leaders and DOE’s Climate Vision, DOE’s 1605b), some facilities are reporting emissions 
source categories. The analysis is based on the understanding that cement facilities perform daily 
sampling and LCA of their raw materials to determine carbonate and organic carbon contents, as 
part of their normal business operations. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. If continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) are available, 
direct measurement of combustion-related and process-related CO2 emissions from cement kilns 
using CEMS is used. If CEMS are not available, facility-specific non-CEMS-based emissions 
estimates are to be developed using the mass-balance approach based on facility-specific analysis 
of carbonate and non-carbonate contents of clinker produced and raw material consumption and 
CKD usage and disposal. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $6,700 in the first year and $5,100 in subsequent years; 
a majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis activities performed by an 
industrial engineer/technician (approximately $5,200 in the first year and $4,700 in subsequent 
years). 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. There is $300 in O&M sampling costs and reporting requires approximately $2,200 for 
contractor costs for software development and maintenance costs. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

a These costs correspond to incremental costs of monitoring emissions using non-CEMS method, via sampling. 
These costs are applicable only for the cement plants that do not have NOx or CO2 CEMS. Eighty-two plants were
identified to have no CEMS installed on their kilns. 
b Corresponds to internally developing the methodology and monitoring plan for calculating emissions from the 
production process. 
c Includes incremental sampling costs, including manger's review. The costs correspond to a laboratory chemical 
analysis of nonfuel raw material inputs—carbonate and total organic carbon contents of 6 inputs, on average (the
number of nonfuel raw material inputs used in cement facilities is in the range of 2 to 10). 
d Includes costs of developing emissions calculations, based on raw material-specific carbon and carbonate 
measurements, raw material consumption data, and facility-specific CKD contents of fuels developed through 
chemical analysis or other methods approved by EPA. Also includes the costs of calculating CH4 and N2O 
emissions using emissions factors, if directed by EPA, and performing QA/QC of GHG emission calculations. 
Includes the incremental costs for regular monitoring of total quantity of all nonfuel raw material inputs (will vary 
by the type and number of raw materials to be measured and the monitoring method) and cement kiln dust, 
including QA/QCing and assembling data, as well. Plants do this activity as part of normal business operations
and incremental costs reflect additional procedures that they need to put in place to standardize the process for 
regulatory data verification and onsite auditing.

4.8 Subpart I—Electronics Manufacturing 
Overview. This analysis is based on the costs of monitoring fluorinated GHG emissions 
from semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Semiconductor facilities constitute the vast 
majority of the electronics facilities likely to report under the rule, and EPA has acquired a 
detailed understanding of semiconductor facilities and their emissions through the PFC 
Reduction/Climate Partnership for Semiconductors, which has been in place since 1995. 
In the proposed rule, semiconductor facilities with production capacities of 10,500 m2 
silicon or greater are considered “large” facilities and those with production capacities less than 
10,500 m2 silicon are considered “small” facilities. “Small” and “large” facilities are subject to 
different reporting requirements, as detailed below under “Monitoring Costs.” These differences 
lead to different annual costs for “small” and “large” semiconductor facilities.  
Other electronics manufacturing facilities (MEMs, Flat Panel Display, Photovoltaics) use 
fewer types of PFCs than the semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Therefore, cost estimates 
4-41 

     
        
         
         
   
  
     
 
for these other types of electronics facilities were developed by scaling the costs for the small 
semiconductor facilities to account for the use of a smaller set of gases. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $14,200 in the first year and subsequent years; a 
majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis activities performed by an 
industrial engineer/technician (approximately $11,300 in the first and subsequent years).  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $14,200 of sampling O&M costs. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) costs.

Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. Reporting requires annual carbon balance using monthly off-site 
sampling by facilities to determine carbon content of each carbonaceous input. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $9,600 in the first year and $8,000 in subsequent years; 
a majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis activities performed by an 
industrial engineer/technician ($8,100 in the first year and $7,500 in subsequent years).  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $12,000 of sampling O&M costs. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.11 	 Subpart L–Fluorinated Gas Production 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as EPA’s Climate 
Leaders and DOE’s Climate Vision, DOE’s 1605b), some facilities are reporting emissions 
source categories. 
Overview. The model fluorinated GHG production facility is one that produces 
fluorinated GHGs, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and a number of fluorinated ethers. Fluorinated 
GHGs can escape during the production process. Emissions can occur from leaks at flanges and 
connections in the production line, from byproduct streams that are imperfectly separated from
the main product stream, and during the filling of tanks or other containers to be shipped on 
trucks and railcars. These are considered fugitive emissions from the production process. For the 
purposes of estimating costs, the single model is a facility that produces fluorinated GHGs.  
Fugitive emissions are calculated using a mass-balance or yield approach. In this 
approach, emissions are equated to the difference between the expected production of each 
fluorinated GHG based on the consumption of reactants and the measured production of that 
fluorinated GHG, accounting for yield losses related to byproducts and wastes.  
Under the proposed rule, owners or operators would be required to use scales and/or flow 
meters with an accuracy of 0.2% of full scale to measure reactants, products, byproducts and 
wastes. In addition, they would be required to perform daily mass balance calculations for each 
product produced. In this calculation, they would be required to account for any product that was 
inadvertently mixed into the byproducts or wastes using equipment and methods (e.g., gas 
chromatography) with an accuracy of 5 percent or better at the concentrations of the process 
samples. 
Labor Costs. Reporting requires 4 hours of labor at a cost of $237. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M requirements for 
this subpart. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned stationary combustion costs 
as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).

4.13 	 Subpart N—Glass Production 
Baseline Reporting. For glass production, we are not sure how many companies are 
currently estimating and reporting emissions at the facility level to meet internal GHG 
management programs or state or voluntary reporting programs at the domestic or international 
level. Therefore, we are assuming that no glass production facilities are currently reporting 
emissions and that many of the proposed requirements will result in “new” or “additional” costs 
to meet reporting requirements. 
However, many glass production facilities are currently tracking much of the data 
required to estimate process-related CO2 emissions on a routine basis (carbonate inputs, supplier 
information on carbonate composition of inputs). We are assuming that the proposed 
requirements will result in “additional” costs primarily to meet EPA’s reporting requirements. 
For example, we assume that additional costs incurred will be for preparing monitoring and 
QA/QC plans, performing the calculations, reporting the results, and maintaining records 
(essentially developing a monitoring plan, reporting, recordkeeping, and QA/QC).  
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. Reporting requires monthly onsite measurements of the weight 
fraction of carbonate inputs (i.e., calcite, dolomite, and sodium carbonate) and calcination 
fractions. This method uses IPCC default emission factors. 
Labor Costs. Reporting requires 25 hours of labor at a cost of $1,500 in the first year. In 
subsequent years, 7 hours are required at a cost of $464.  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M requirements for 
this subpart. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3).

4.14 	 Subpart O—HCFC-22 Production 
Overview. Three HCFC-22 production facilities operated in the United States in 2006. 
For the purpose of estimating costs, a model facility was developed by taking the average of
facility-specific cost estimates; the facility-specific cost estimates vary primarily depending on 
the process architecture of each facility. Hence, the model facility is an average facility that 
incurs the average of costs across all facilities.  
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $5,600 in the first year and subsequent years; a 
majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis activities.  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M requirements for 
this subpart. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as

4.15 Subpart P—Hydrogen Production 
Overview. The estimated 77 merchant hydrogen production facilities in the United States 
range in capacity from around 6 to almost 200,000 metric tons of hydrogen per year. Even so, the 
same amount of data are collected for each facility, and therefore the monitoring cost for each 
site is the same. The feedstock mass balance cost data are calculated for merchant hydrogen 
production facilities using natural gas, other hydrocarbon gases and liquids, and solid fuels (coal, 
pet coke) as feedstock. For this analysis, there is no distinction in the feedstock mass balance 
cost data for the various feedstock materials. 
The monitoring approach is a hybrid method which combines direct measurement by 
CEMS, where CEMS components are currently employed for other purposes, and the fuel and 
feedstock mass balance approach at facilities where CEMS are not currently employed or at 
facilities where combustion or process CO2 emissions are emitted via secondary stacks or vents. 
CEMS-method facilities will have CO2 monitoring in place and will retrofit CEMS by installing 
a stack flow meter. CEMS costs have been addressed under Stationary Combustion in the RIA, 
consequently, this cost analysis is focused on only those facilities that will use the fuel and 
feedstock mass balance approach. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $3,100 in the first year and $1,500 in subsequent years; 
a majority of the labor costs are associated with planning and sampling and analysis activities 
(including manager’s review).

4.16 Subpart Q—Iron and Steel Production 
Baseline Reporting. Through voluntary domestic initiatives (such as DOE’s Climate 
Vision), the U.S. iron and steel industry as a sector has undertaken voluntary efforts to develop a 
simple protocol (based on default emission factors), educate association members, and track 
emission intensity of production (more information is available at: 
http://www.climatevision.gov/sectors/steel/index.html). 
Several iron and steel companies in the United States and abroad have recommended and 
are using a carbon balance approach similar to the proposed method. Based on private 
communications with steel industry representatives and general knowledge of plant operations, it 
is recognized that many of the measurements required for that approach, such as the amount of 
specific feedstocks consumed, production rates from each process, process gas (coke oven gas, 
blast furnace gas) production and consumption, and purchased fuel consumption, are already 
routinely measured and used for accounting purposes (e.g., determining the cost of production), 
process control, and yield calculations. For example, U.S. steel plants report many of these 
measurements to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), and AISI compiles annual 
nationwide statistics from the reported information (e.g., see http://www.steel.org/AM/ 
Template.cfm?Section=Statistics). Consequently, the proposed approach offers an advantage in 
that it would use a significant amount of information that is already readily available to 
companies and their facilities. 
4-55 

  
However, it is not clear how many companies are currently implementing this approach 
at the facility level to meet internal GHG management programs or state or voluntary reporting 
programs at the domestic or international level. Therefore, we are assuming that iron and steel 
production facilities are not currently reporting emissions and that many of the proposed 
requirements will result in “new” or “additional” costs to meet reporting requirements. For 
example, we assume that additional costs will be incurred for preparing monitoring and QA/QC 
plans, sampling and analysis of process inputs and outputs for carbon content, performing the 
calculations, reporting the results, and maintaining records. The only significant element of the 
approach that we know is performed routinely by all companies is that they have measurements 
and records of process inputs and outputs as part of their routine operation. 
Labor Costs. The labor costs are associated with all activities are $146,000 in the first 
year and $112,000 in subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Annualized performance testing costs are estimated to be $2,400. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned stationary combustion costs 
as described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.17 	 Subpart R—Lead Production 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as EPA’s Climate 
Leaders and DOE’s Climate Vision, DOE’s 1605b), some facilities are reporting emissions 
source categories. The analysis assumes that facilities have measurements and records of
consumption of raw materials such as reducing agents as part of their routine operations and for 
accounting purposes. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. Reporting requires Annual carbon balance using monthly 
measurement of the carbon content of up to three reductants (e.g., metallurgical coke) sent off-

4.18 Subpart S—Lime Manufacturing 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such DOE’s Climate Vision, 
DOE’s 1605b), the National Lime Association (NLA), which represents 95% of the domestic 
commercial lime production sector, has undertaken voluntary efforts to develop a GHG 
emissions protocol (based on facility specific information), educate association members, and 
track emissions intensity of production (more information is available at: 
http://www.climatevision.gov/sectors/lime/index.html). 
NLA members have recommended and are using the NLA method. For example, U.S. 
lime manufacturing facilities report many of these measurements to NLA, and NLA compiles 
annual nationwide statistics from the reported information. Consequently, the proposed approach 
offers an advantage in that it would use a significant amount of information that is already 
readily available to companies and their facilities. 
Given that NLA represents a significant number of lime producers and a significant 
amount of domestic lime production, we are assuming that lime production facilities are 
currently collecting the data to report process related CO2 emissions at the facility level (monthly 
lime production, CaO and MgO content of lime products, calcinations of byproducts). We are 
assuming that the proposed requirements will result in “additional” costs primarily to meet 
EPA’s reporting requirements. For example, we assume that additional costs incurred will be for
preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, performing the calculations, reporting the results, and 
maintaining records (essentially developing a monitoring plan, reporting, recordkeeping, and 
QA/QC). 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. 
Labor Costs. The labor costs are associated with planning are $1,600 in the first year and 
subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment and O&M requirements for 
this subpart. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3).

4.19 Subpart T—Magnesium Production 
Overview. Costs for estimating GHG emissions from magnesium production and 
processing facilities were estimated for emissions of SF6 and other cover gases. Estimating SF6 
and other cover gas GHG emissions requires facility-specific data on cover gas consumption. 
The primary cover gas of concern is SF6, with replacement compounds such as HFC-134a also 
being tracked when utilized. The methodology for which cost estimates were developed is based 
upon a simple estimate of cover gas consumption by facility. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $2,700 in the first year and subsequent years; a 
majority of the labor costs are associated with sampling and analysis ($1,900) and reporting 
activities ($700). 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $150 of reporting and sampling O&M costs. The costs 
are associated with process emissions. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.20 Subpart V—Nitric Acid Production 
Overview. Costs were developed for the following proposed monitoring option for 
estimating N2O emissions from nitric acid production. The proposed option is to follow the Tier 
3 approach established by IPCC using non-continuous monitoring: directly monitor N2O 
emissions and determine the relationship between nitric acid production and the amount of N2O 
emissions (i.e., develop a site-specific emissions factor). The site-specific emissions factor and 
production rate (activity level) is used to calculate the emissions. Annual testing of N2O 
emissions would also be required to verify the emission factor over time. Testing would also be 
required whenever significant process changes are made.  
This option uses non-continuous direct monitoring of N2O emissions to determine the 
relationship between nitric acid production and the amount of N2O emissions. As the production 
rate changes, a new N2O emission rate could be calculated. Annual testing of N2O emissions 
would also be required to verify the emission factor over time. Testing would also be required 
whenever significant process changes are made. 
The proposed monitoring method for calculating process emissions from nitric acid 
production would involve this facility-level calculation on a monthly basis and stack testing on 
an annual basis. Each facility needs to internally develop the methodology and monitoring plan 
for calculating the process emissions from the nitric acid production process.

4.21 	 Subpart W—Oil and Natural Gas Systems 
Overview. For each of the industry segments, operations had to be divided into single 
units or model facilities at three levels; “small,” “medium,” and “large.” The monitoring costs 
were then developed per size level of a model facility. A model facility of a given level can be 
defined as the most convenient and logical unit with appropriate emissions source counts that can 
aggregate to any size company to determine its monitoring costs. For example, in onshore natural 
gas transmission, a compressor station as a facility was modeled at the different levels. Any 
transmission company can determine its monitoring costs by assigning model facility costs to its 
facilities that are closest to the appropriate level of the model facility. 
For each of the sources designated for monitoring, both equipment and component counts 
were determined to define individual model facilities. For onshore natural gas processing, 
onshore natural gas transmission, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage and import 
facilities, emissions source counts for medium facilities were assigned the national average 
activity factors from the National Inventory. The related uncertainty in those activity factors 
were used to determine the lower bound on emissions source counts, and assigned to a “small” 
facility. Similarly, the upper bound on emissions source counts was assigned to a “large” facility. 
In the case of offshore petroleum and natural gas production, MMS GOADS-2000 data analysis 
by EPA was used in the same fashion as the national inventories. In some cases, the uncertainty 
estimates were not applicable. For example, if the uncertainty is over 100%, it would predict a 
negative lower bound for emissions source counts. For these cases, expert judgment was used. 
Expert judgment was also used, where necessary, to adjust emissions source counts to reflect real 
world scenarios. 
4-66 

 Labor Costs. To evaluate labor costs, it was necessary not only to determine the amount 
of time required for all of the tasks associated with monitoring, but also to determine who will 
perform each task. For the sake of this analysis, four labor categories were used. Assigning labor 
hours for all cost elements was based on expert judgment. When assigning hours, the size of the 
facility and role of the labor categories were taken into consideration.  
Capital and O&M Costs. The labor costs associated with performing the actual annual 
monitoring were omitted from the table above. For these costs it was assumed that all labor will 
be performed by middle managers, junior engineers, and senior operators. Middle managers will 
spend a total of 2 hours overseeing the monitoring process per quarter, but will not perform any 
of the monitoring. It was assumed that junior engineers will do all of the monitoring, except in 
cases where senior operators will log any activity data required to estimate emissions over the 
course of the quarter. Several equipment types are common between different onshore segments 
and different facility sizes, but the actual monitoring time will not change per equipment unit. 
For example, reciprocating compressors are found in all onshore segments for facilities of almost 
all sizes. Screening a single reciprocating compressor for leaks was assumed to take 2 hours 
onshore, and that will not change by segment or facility size. What changes is the number of 
reciprocating compressors. Thus, a series of universal assumptions about onshore monitoring 
times were created. These were multiplied by the emissions source counts assigned to each of the 
model facilities to determine the required labor hours. Once the labor hours were calculated, by 
category, for each of the cost elements, they were multiplied by the associated labor rates to 
estimate labor costs per facility. The only remaining facility costs are due to the annualized 
capital costs and travel, lodging, and shipping to conduct the actual emissions monitoring. 
The capital costs related to monitoring emissions and archiving of information consists of 
purchasing equipment for emissions detection, emissions measurement, and information storage. 
All costs are reported in 2006 U.S. dollars and annualization was assumed over an equipment life 
of 5 years with a 7% interest rate. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned stationary combustion costs 
as described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.22 Subpart X—Petrochemical Production 
Overview. Each petrochemical production facility would measure the flow rate and 
carbon content (or composition) of each feedstock and each product. Flow rates would be 
measured continuously, and carbon content would be measured at least once per week. The 
difference in the carbon content between the feedstocks and the products would provide an 
estimate of the process-based CO2 emissions. Facilities would also measure the flow and carbon 
content of supplemental fuel used in combustion units that supply energy to the petrochemical 
process at the recommended frequency for stationary fuel combustion sources. For this analysis, 
natural gas was assumed to be the supplemental fuel, which means the flow would be measured 
continuously, and the carbon content would be measured once per month. This information 
4-68 

 would be used in the applicable equations for stationary fuel combustion sources to estimate the 
CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from combustion sources associated with petrochemical 
processes. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $14,800 in the first year and $10,800 in subsequent 
years; a majority of the labor costs are associated with quality assurance and control checks, 
recordkeeping, and planning activities. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Equipment O&M costs approximately $1,800 per year and performance testing requires 
approximately $1,900 per year.  
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use costs only.

4.23 Subpart Y—Petroleum Refineries 
Overview. For costing purposes, the monitoring options were divided into those that 
required the installation of new monitors and those that did not. As described below, the costs 
associated with installing and operating a new monitor also include costs of QA/QC checks and 
reporting. Costs for monitoring options that are not expected to require new monitoring systems 
were estimated by the anticipated amount of labor needed to carry out the monitoring option. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $12,300 in the first year and $6,500 in subsequent 
years; a majority of the labor costs are associated with planning, QA/QC checks, and 
recordkeeping and reporting and planning activities. These costs cover process emissions and 
stationary combustion sources.  
Capital and O&M Costs. Average annualized capital equipment requirements are $1,200 
per year. Equipment O&M costs approximately $7,300 per year. These costs cover process 
emissions and stationary combustion sources. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use and recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) costs.

4.24 Subpart Z—Phosphoric Acid Production 
Baseline Reporting. We are not aware of any phosphoric acid production facilities that 
are estimating and reporting emissions for internal GHG management programs or for state or 
voluntary reporting programs at the domestic or international level. Thus, we are assuming that 
no phosphoric acid production facilities are currently reporting emissions and that many of the 
proposed requirements will result in “additional” costs to meet reporting requirements.  
Facilities are tracking and collecting the data required for estimating emissions such as 
such as phosphate rock feed rates and sampling and testing phosphate rock for its inorganic 
carbon contents. According to Jasinski (2008), the companies conduct analysis on the rock 
frequently to determine the P2O5 content and the level of impurities. According to CF industries 
(Falls, 2008), they analyze a composite of incoming phosphate rock for carbon contents on a 
daily basis. The phosphate rock consumed or entering the digestion process is also measured on a 
daily basis. 
Therefore, we are assuming that the proposed requirements will result in “additional” 
costs primarily to meet EPA’s reporting requirements. Specifically, we assume that additional 
costs will be incurred for preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, performing the calculations, 
reporting the results, and maintaining records. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed.

Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. 
Labor Costs. The labor costs are associated with planning are $1,600 in the first year and 
$500 in subsequent years related to industrial process emissions.  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment and O&M requirements for 
this subpart related to industrial process emissions.  
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.26 	 Subpart BB—Silicon Carbide Production 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as EPA’s Climate 
Leaders and DOE’s Climate Vision, DOE’s 1605b), some facilities are reporting emissions 
source categories. The analysis assumes that facilities have measurements and records of
consumption of the amount of petroleum coke as part of their routine operations and for 
accounting purposes. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. Reporting requires estimating CO2 emissions based on quarterly 
measurement of the amount of petroleum coke consumed. This method uses plant-specific 
carbon content and carbon oxidation factors. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $2,200 in the first year and $1,000 in subsequent years; 
a majority of the labor costs are associated with planning ($1,600). Planning costs fall to $500 in 
subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $800 of sampling O&M costs. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as 
described in subpart C (Table 4-3).

4.27 Subpart CC—Soda Ash Manufacturing 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as DOE’s Climate 
Vision, DOE’s 1605b), the Industrial Minerals Association North America (IMA-NA), which 
represents soda ash producers as a sector, has undertaken voluntary efforts to develop a GHG 
emissions protocol (based default emissions factors), educate association members about 
measuring and reporting GHG emissions, and track emissions intensity of production for the 
sector (more information is available at: http://www.climatevision.gov/sectors/minerals/ 
index.html). 
We do not know how many soda ash companies are currently implementing this 
approach at the facility level to meet internal GHG management programs or state or voluntary 
reporting programs at the domestic or international level. We are assuming that no soda ash 
production facilities are currently reporting emissions and that many of the proposed 
requirements will result in “new” or “additional” costs to meet reporting requirements.  
However, soda ash production facilities are currently collecting and tracking the data 
required for estimating process-related CO2 emissions on a routine basis. We understand that 
soda ash producers sample and measure purity of soda ash and/or trona in-house on a routine 
basis (i.e., inorganic carbon contents of trona). We are assuming that the proposed requirements 
will result in “additional” costs primarily to meet EPA’s reporting requirements. Specifically, we 
are assuming that additional costs incurred will be for preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, 
performing the calculations, reporting the results, and maintaining records (essentially 
developing a monitoring plan, reporting, recordkeeping, and QA/QC).  
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are associated with planning ($1,600). Planning costs fall 
to $500 in subsequent years.

4.28 Subpart DD—Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) from Electric Power Systems 
Overview. The model facility for electric power systems is an electric utility that operates 
an average amount (nameplate capacity) of SF6-containing transmission equipment. Costs are not 
expected to vary widely among utilities because all utilities would track the same set of 
quantities (SF6 stored, acquired, and disbursed; equipment installed and retired), and the costs of 
tracking and reporting these quantities are relatively modest.  
The model facility is assumed to already have the capital and technical capability to 
monitor and report emissions of SF6 using a mass-balance formula. To use the formula, facilities 
must track their SF6 inventory in cylinders, SF6 acquisitions, and SF6 disbursements, as well as 
their equipment commissioning and decommissioning. These data are already tracked by 
utilities, but not necessarily as closely and comprehensively as required to develop all utility 
level mass-balance inputs. Thus, as discussed below, the model facility is assumed to incur some
costs for tracking and reporting SF6 emissions. 
Labor Costs. Total labor costs are $2,200 in the first year and subsequent years; a 
majority of the labor costs are associated with planning activities ($1,600).  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements. A small 
amount of O&M recordkeeping is required ($12).  
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use and reporting ($500) costs.

4.29 Subpart EE—Titanium Dioxide Production 
Baseline Reporting. In this sector, data are not available on how many companies are 
currently estimating and reporting GHG emissions at the facility level to meet internal GHG 
management programs or state or voluntary reporting programs at the domestic or international 
level. We are assuming that no titanium dioxide production facilities are currently reporting 
emissions and that many of the proposed requirements will result in “new” or “additional” costs 
to meet reporting requirements.  
However, many titanium dioxide production facilities are currently tracking much of the 
data required to estimate process-related CO2 emissions on a routine basis (calcined petroleum
coke consumption). We are assuming that the proposed requirements will result in “additional” 
costs primarily to meet EPA’s reporting requirements. For example, we assume that additional 
costs incurred will be for preparing monitoring and QA/QC plans, performing the calculations, 
reporting the results, and maintaining records (essentially developing a monitoring plan, 
reporting, recordkeeping, and QA/QC). 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. 
Labor Costs. The labor costs are associated with planning are $1,600 in the first year and 
$500 in subsequent years related to industrial process emissions.  
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment and O&M requirements for 
this subpart related to industrial process emissions.  
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned stationary combustion costs as

4.30 Subpart FF—Underground Coal Mines 
Overview. For purposes of this RIA, each mine exceeding the MSHA threshold was 
assumed to have two ventilation shafts where quarterly sampling was conducted. For mine 
degasification systems, only those systems where degasification systems are in place were 
considered. For these facilities, one degasification well per facility was assumed. For remote gob 
gas vent wells/holes that do not currently monitor degasified gas volumes produced, incremental 
costs are also associated with installing simple monitoring equipment on these remote gob gas 
vent holes. For purposes of developing costs, five gob wells were assumed per long wall panel, 
applied to the approximately 40 long wall mines in the United States that do not monitor such 
vents.1 
Labor Costs. For coal mining, labor categories include manager, industrial 
engineer/technician, and administrative support. The labor costs are associated with oversight, 
auditing, and/or duplication of MSHA inspectors during quarterly inspections to estimate 
ventilation air emissions. Total labor costs are approximately $15,600 in the first year and 
$15,400 in subsequent years. The majority of these costs ($8,000) are associated with sampling 
and analysis activities. 
Capital and O&M Costs. The capital investment is $6,200. Using a lifetime of 4 years 
and an interest rate of 7%, the annualized capital expenditures are approximately $1,700 per 
affected entity. An additional $4,000 of O&M costs are required per year. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned 
recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.31 	 Subpart GG—Zinc Production 
Baseline Reporting. Under voluntary domestic initiatives (such as EPA’s Climate 
Leaders and DOE’s Climate Vision, DOE’s 1605b), some facilities are reporting emissions 
source categories. The analysis assumes that facilities have measurements and records of
consumption of raw materials such as reducing agents as part of their routine operations and for 
accounting purposes. 
Overview. Insufficient data was available to differentiate costs for compiling data and 
conducting sampling across different facilities; hence, model facilities were not developed. 
Professional judgment was used to develop cost estimates and sampling frequency was assumed 
not to differ by facility size. Reporting requires annual carbon balance using monthly off-site 
sampling of the amount of carbon contained in the reducing agent, usually metallurgical coke.  
Labor Costs. A majority of the labor costs are associated with planning ($1,600 in the 
first year) and sampling and analysis activities ($1,600). Planning activity costs fall to $500 in 
subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment requirements for this 
subpart. Reporting requires approximately $2,400 of sampling O&M costs. The costs are 
associated with process emissions. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is assigned additional stationary combustion 
costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3). 
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.32 Subpart HH—Landfills 
Overview. Costs were developed to model emissions using the IPCC waste model (or 
similar model) using the waste composition option (all landfills). Tables 4-60 and 4-61 report the 
average values for all landfills (MSW only, pulp and paper, and food processing). 
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $900 per entity in the first 
year and $400 in subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. The capital investment is $1,600. Using a lifetime of 15 years 
and an interest rate of 7%, the annualized capital expenditures are approximately $175 per 
affected entity. There is an additional $500 in equipment O&M costs per year. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use and recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) costs.

4.33 	Subpart II—Wastewater 
Overview. For this source category, EPA evaluated ethanol refinery wastewater treatment 
plants, pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment plants, and petroleum refinery wastewater 
treatment plants to represent the types of wastewater treatment systems with the greatest
potential to exceed the GHG threshold. These costs were added to the appropriate industrial 
subpart (J, AA, and Y). 
For each industry category, EPA first attempted to locate any plant-level datasets that 
would allow direct calculation of GHG emissions by plant. Where plant-level data were 
incomplete, EPA used default national-level data from the National Inventory to fill in missing 
data. Where plant-level data were unavailable, EPA instead determined the production levels for 
each industry that would trigger emissions over any of the thresholds of interest, and used best 
professional judgment to estimate how many plants would meet the production levels. 
For pulp and paper mills, EPA used the most readily available plant-level dataset, which 
contains 94 of the largest U.S. pulp and paper mills (as of 1995). The dataset contains pulp 
production data collected by U.S. EPA’s Office of Water during development of national 
effluent limitation guidelines and standards for this industry. As such, the mills are not identified 
by name. Because the dataset did not include plant-specific information on wastewater 
generation rates, influent BOD or COD levels, or treatment processes on site, EPA used default 
values from the National Inventory.  
For petroleum refineries, EPA obtained a plant-specific dataset from the Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), with refinery capacity for all facilities as of January 2007. 
4-91 

  
  
         
        
       
         
       
 
   
The EIA data did not include plant-specific information on wastewater generation rates, influent 
BOD or COD levels, or treatment processes on site. Therefore, EPA used default values from the 
National Inventory and other reporting guidelines. 
Labor Costs. The annual cost to operate the continuous measurement system includes the 
cost to calibrate the analyzers monthly and to compile annual emission reports. These tasks are 
assumed to require 14 hours per year for an industrial technician. The annual costs also include 
$200 for gas analyzer calibration kits. The total annual costs including labor and calibration kits 
are $973. EPA estimates that 2 hours of labor is needed per month to collect and organize flow 
data, for a total annual cost of $871. EPA estimates that 1 hour of labor is needed for each 
sampling episode. Each COD wastewater sample is estimated to have analytical costs of $30, 
based on an average of laboratory rate schedules. EPA assumed monthly sampling episodes, 
which results in an annual sampling cost of $995. 
Capital and O&M Costs. EPA assumes that continuous gas composition monitoring from
anaerobic digestion systems would require a continuous gas composition analyzer, a temperature 
sensor, a gas pressure sensor, and a data logger. The total capital cost for these items is $3,280– 
$4,000; EPA estimates these costs to be $3,640. For wastewater treatment operations, EPA used 
an equipment lifetime of 10 years and interest rate of 7% to annualize capital costs. Annualized 
capital costs are $344 per year. The costs only apply to ethanol facilities and nine meat 
processing facilities.

4.34 	 Subpart JJ—Manure Management 
Baseline Reporting. Farms maintain records on the number and types of animals present; 
however, they generally do not run calculations for CH4 and N2O generation. It is therefore 
assumed that the costs for monitoring and reporting emissions are new costs. 
Overview. For this source category, EPA developed a number of model farms to 
represent the manure management systems that are most common on large farms and have the 
greatest potential to exceed the GHG thresholds. Operations were divided into model farms 
representing 12 distinct manure management systems:  
 a beef farm with a pasture system; 
 a beef feedlot; 
 a dairy farm with an anaerobic lagoon system without solid separation; 
 a dairy farm with an anaerobic lagoon system with solid separation; 
 a dairy farm with a liquid/slurry system without solid separation; 
 a dairy farm with a liquid/slurry system with solid separation;
 a farrow-to-finish swine farm with a deep pit system; 
 a farrow-to-finish swine farm with an anaerobic lagoon system; 
 a caged layer farm with an anaerobic lagoon system; 
 a caged layer farm with manure drying; 
4-93 

  
 
 
 
 a turkey farm with bedding (litter); and 
 a broiler farm with bedding (litter). 
EPA determined the number of head that would need to be present at each model farm to 
reach the reporting threshold under consideration (assuming no anaerobic digester is present on 
the farm. Based on information from EPA’s Development Document for the Final Revisions to 
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Regulation and the Effluent 
Guidelines for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), model dairy farms were 
assumed to have population distributions that are comprised of 63% dairy cows, 19% dairy 
heifers, and 19% calves. At each model dairy farm, the heifers and calves were assumed to be 
managed on dry lots, and the dairy cows were managed on liquid systems (either anaerobic 
lagoons or liquid/slurry systems). The population distributions for beef and swine were estimated 
based on the U.S. total populations from the National Inventory; this estimate assumes that all 
U.S. farms would have the same distribution of animal types.  
Labor Costs. Assigning labor hours for all cost elements was based on expert judgment. 
First year planning requires 10 hours at a cost of $228. EPA estimates annual costs for manure 
sampling based on The Cost Methodology for the Final Revisions to the National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System Regulation and the Effluent Guidelines for Concentrated Animal 
Feeding Operations (EPA, December 2002, EPA-821-R-03-004). Labor costs for manure 
sampling are estimated to be $16.12 an hour for farm labor with an hour of labor needed for each 
sampling episode. Each sample is estimated to have analytical costs of $40. EPA assumed 
monthly sampling episodes, which results in an annual sampling cost of $193. The farm owner is 
responsible for collecting the data required to perform the calculations required by the rule. 
These data include the population of animals at the facility, the average weight of the animals, 
and the annual average ambient temperature. The annual gathering of these data, performing the 
calculations, and completing the paperwork are estimated to require 4 hours at an estimated cost 
of $198. The annual cost to operate the continuous measurement system includes the cost to 
calibrate the analyzers monthly and to compile annual emission reports. These tasks are assumed 
to require 14 hours per year at a rate of $49.53 per hour for the farm owner or designee. The 
annual costs also include $200 for gas analyzer calibration kits. The total annual cost, including 
labor and calibration kits, is $693. 
Capital and O&M Costs. For one farm, reporting requiring continuous gas composition 
monitoring equipment for anaerobic digestion systems would require a continuous gas flow 
meter, a continuous gas composition analyzer, a temperature sensor, a gas pressure sensor, and a 
data logger; the total capital cost is $6,750. EPA used an equipment lifetime of 10 years and an

interest rate of 7% to annualize capital costs. Annualized capital costs are $961 per year. For the 
other 42 farms, a manure sampler is required with a total capital cost of $30. Annualized capital 
costs are $4 per year. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use, recordkeeping ($1,700 per entity) and reporting ($500) costs.

4.35 	 Subpart KK—Suppliers of Coal and Coal-based Products & Subpart LL— 
Suppliers of Coal-based Liquid Fuels 
Overview. All coal mines are required to report under this rule. A mine is defined as any 
facility considered by MSHA to be actively engaged in the production of coal during the 
reporting year. There are two model facilities: those producing 100,000 tons or more annually 
during the reporting year (large mines) and those producing less than 100,000 tons annually 
(small mines). A section for facilities that produce liquid fuel from coal is also includes in this 
rule. However, since no such facilities are in operation in the United States, a cost analysis was 
not conducted. It is anticipated that such facilities may be in operation in the future. 
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $6,800 per entity in the first 
year and $2,500 in subsequent years. Most of the costs are related to registration and monitoring. 
Capital and O&M Costs. The annualized capital expenditures and O&M are less than $5 
per year. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use only.

4.36 Subpart MM—Suppliers of Petroleum Products 
Overview. All refineries are required to report under this rule. The unit of reporting is the 
individual refinery. No distinction has been made between the sizes of refineries for estimating 
the monitoring costs because the rule would require additional processing of data that refineries 
already collect and report. Under the rule, individual operating refineries are the reporters as 
opposed to the parent company. For example, Exxon Corporation owns and operates six 
refineries within the United States. Each operating refinery will be a reporter under this rule, not 
Exxon Corporation. 
Capital and O&M Costs. The capital investment is $1,600. Using a lifetime of 15 years 
and an interest rate of 7%, the annualized capital expenditures are approximately $175 per 
affected entity. There is an additional $500 in equipment O&M costs per year. 
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $9,300 per entity in the first 
year and $3,500 in subsequent years. Most of the costs are related to registration and monitoring. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).

 Mohawk in upstate; and other LDCs in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Each 
operating company in each state will be a reporter under this rule, not National Grid.  
The rule covers all natural gas processing plants. The unit of reporting is the processing 
plant or facility. As defined in the rule, these are plants designed to separate and recover natural 
gas liquids (NGLs) or other gases and liquids from a stream of produced natural gas and to 
control the quality of natural gas marketed. Thus, the plants covered deliver pipeline quality 
natural gas to pipelines but not include field gathering and boosting stations or fractionation 
plants that do not deliver processed gas but only fractionate NGL streams. Companies may own 
more than one processing plant: each plant is required to report under this rule. No distinction 
has been made between the sizes of natural gas processors for estimating the monitoring costs 
because the rule only would require additional processing of data that natural gas processors 
already collect as part of their ongoing business and report on EIA Form 816. 
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $1,300 per entity in the first 
year and $800 in subsequent years. Most of the costs are related to registration and monitoring. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M expenses. 
Stationary Combustion Costs. This subpart is not assigned additional stationary 
combustion costs as described in subpart C (Table 4-3).  
Electricity Use, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Costs. This subpart is assigned electricity 
use only.

4.38 Subpart OO—Suppliers of Industrial Greenhouse Gases  
Overview. The industrial gas supply category includes facilities that produce N2O or 
fluorinated GHGs (e.g., HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and fluorinated anesthetics), importers of N2O 
or fluorinated GHGs, and exporters of N2O or fluorinated GHGs. As described below, costs were 
estimated for model facilities that encompass the likely combinations of these entities and 
activities. In addition, because importers of fluorinated GHGs and N2O frequently also import 
CO2, and because importers would be required to sum their CO2-equivalent imports across gases 
to determine whether they exceeded the reporting threshold, this analysis considers imports of 
CO2. While a TSD was prepared for imports of gas in products, EPA is not proposing to require 
that importers of products report. Thus, imports in products are not included in the totals below. 
However, EPA estimates that the burden and cost per importer for importers of pre-charged 
products would be comparable to (slightly smaller than) those estimated below for producers and 
importers of bulk gases. 
There are four model facilities that fall under Industrial Gas Supply. Each one represents 
the specific reporting activities (production, import, export, transformation, or destruction) and 
costs relevant to each category. 
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $1,300 per entity in the first 
year and $800 in subsequent years. Most of the costs are related to registration and monitoring. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M expenses.

4.39 Subpart PP—Suppliers of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) 
Overview. All 13 existing CO2 capture sites and CO2 production well sites are included in 
the cost estimate. The monitoring option for each site involves a CO2 flow meter, and therefore 
the monitoring cost for each site is the same. Hence, model facilities were not needed for 
characterizing the facility and estimating the relevant costs.  
Labor Costs. Labor costs are estimated to be approximately $237 per entity in the first 
year and subsequent years. 
Capital and O&M Costs. There are no new capital equipment or O&M expenses.

4.40 Mobile Sources 
Mobile source costs for the proposed rule are estimated for upstream vehicles and engine 
manufactures and are associated with the fixed certification costs of a new regulation. Typically, 
our cost analysis focuses on variable costs associated with engine or vehicle technologies needed 
to meet new emissions standards. However, since we are not proposing new emission standards, 
the proposed requirements have no such variable costs. Certification costs, including those 
estimated here, are typically modest relative to the much larger costs of redesigning and 
modifying vehicles and engines to comply with new emissions standards. Costs are categorized 
into reporting and recordkeeping (labor) costs, new test equipment/facility (equipment) costs, 
and incremental testing (operating and maintenance) costs. 
4.40.1 Source Description and Baseline Reporting 
The concept of a reporting “threshold” for mobile engine manufacturers differs from the 
approach proposed for other sectors in this rule. EPA would not have manufacturers determine 
their eligibility based on total tons emitted per year. EPA’s current mobile source criteria 
pollutant control programs are based on emissions rates over prescribed test cycles rather than 
tons per year estimates. Since EPA is proposing to build on our existing system, we believe that 
a threshold based on manufacturer size is appropriate for the mobile source sector. Although the 
emission rates of some vehicles and engines would not be reported, we do not believe this is a 
concern because the technologies—and thus emission rates—from larger manufacturers 
4-105 

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
represent the same basic technologies and emission rates of essentially all vehicles and engines. 
Estimates of the number of affected manufacturers are provided in Table 4-76. 
Baseline Reporting. Manufacturers currently conduct vehicle and engine emissions 
testing as part of EPA's existing emissions control programs. Manufacturers already measure 
CO2, although in some cases are not currently required to report CO2 test results to EPA. N2O 
and CH4 measurement and reporting would be new for several mobile source categories, as 
discussed below. Manufacturers not already measuring N2O and CH4 would need to install new 
measurement equipment, but new testing would not be needed since these pollutants would be 
measured over existing tests. The A/C idle test for vehicles would be a new requirement with 
associated incremental testing costs, as discussed below. Regarding the aircraft engine category, 
we assume that there are no costs associated with proposed reporting requirements, but request 
comment in the preamble on the degree to which these engine manufacturers already have the 
necessary equipment in their certification test cells.

4.40.2 Labor Costs: Reporting and Recordkeeping 
Reporting and recordkeeping cost estimates account for the staff and management hours 
needed to review and submit new data to EPA as part of the certification process. For all 
categories, manufacturers would be required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions levels. 
4-106 

                                                  
 
   
Vehicle manufacturers would also be required to submit CO2 emissions results from the new A/C 
idle test, and A/C system scoring results. Manufacturers have been submitting certification data 
to EPA for many years, and the process for collecting and submitting data to EPA is highly 
automated for most manufacturers. Once the test cells and computer systems are set up to collect 
and submit the data, the act of submitting the incremental emissions data to EPA as part of 
certification would be routine. We therefore estimate a minimal incremental burden for 
reporting, 10 to 20 minutes each for managerial staff, engineering staff, and secretarial staff per 
vehicle/engine family, to ensure the appropriate data are submitted to EPA. For light-duty 
vehicles, manufacturers would report emissions results for both fuel economy testing and in-use 
verification testing. 
For light-duty vehicles, there is an additional reporting and recordkeeping cost 
component for A/C system scoring and recordkeeping. We recognize that this is somewhat more 
involved than reporting emissions test results, because A/C systems must be evaluated and scores 
calculated. We estimate that each air conditioning system evaluation and associated 
recordkeeping would take 30 minutes to 1 hour of managerial time, 1 to 2 hours of engineering 
time, and 15 to 30 minutes of secretarial time. We estimate one air conditioning system per every 
three vehicle models, or about 400 air conditioning systems across all light-duty vehicles. For 
chassis-certified heavy-duty vehicles, we’ve included an additional six systems, although 
systems may be the same across light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle models for individual 
manufacturers. 
Using labor rate statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for vehicle and engine 
manufacturers, with overhead 60% over the baseline applied (a multiplier of 1.6), we estimated 
reporting costs for each mobile source category.9 For emissions reporting and recordkeeping, we 
used these labor rates, the estimated hours needed for reporting/recordkeeping for each 
vehicle/engine family as described above, and the number of vehicle and engine families 
estimated from EPA’s certification databases, to calculate reporting costs. For vehicle air 
conditioning system reporting/recordkeeping costs, we used the labor rates, estimated hours 
needed for each air conditioning system, and the estimated number of air conditioning systems. 
The estimated number of vehicle/engine families and the average of the low and high estimates 
are provided in Table 4-77.

4.40.3 Equipment Costs: Test Equipment/Facility Upgrades 
We have included estimated “start-up” capital costs associated with new test equipment 
for measuring N20 and CH4 for each affected test cell, except in cases where manufacturers 
already have this equipment. We estimated the number of test cells that would be affected in 
each category. For light-duty vehicles, the estimated number of test cells is based on certification 
data provided by manufacturers. For all other categories, where we do not have detailed test cell 
information for all manufacturers, we estimated one test cell for every six engine families 
certified for each manufacturer, based on our general understanding of certification testing and 
manufacturer test facilities. 
We are including $50,000 per test cell for equipping the test cells with CH4 measurement 
capabilities and $20,000 per test cell for N20 measurement capabilities. These costs include the 
costs of the analyzers and related costs, including installation.  
4-108 

  
 
 
We have also estimated an incremental increased facility cost associated with the use of 
test facilities for running the proposed A/C CO2 idle test for each vehicle test group. While we do 
not believe manufacturers will need significant new facilities to run the short idle test in 
conjunction with other emission testing, we believe it is reasonable to recognize that the new test 
could have incremental facility costs associated with it. No additional emissions measurement 
equipment is needed for vehicle A/C testing because manufacturers already have CO2 
measurement capabilities. Any costs would be associated with the additional time needed for the 
test. 
We expect the A/C idle test to take less than 1 hour to run and it should fit into the testing 
sequence without significant disruption. To estimate incremental costs, we used a ratio of the 
time needed for the idle test (1 hour) with the time needed for certification testing (30 hours). We
applied this ratio to an estimate of the facility costs per annual certification test. We estimate that 
a typical test facility is capable of performing 750 FTP/Highway fuel economy tests per year and 
the facility costs about $4 million to build, or about $5,333 per annual FTP test conducted. These 
estimates are based on EPA’s experience working with manufacturers and test labs. Applying the 
ratio described above (1/30) to the annual test cost for an FTP results in an incremental facility 
cost estimate for the new A/C idle test of $178 per test. To estimate an overall facility cost, the 
$178 estimate was multiplied by the number of A/C idle tests per year, 1,250 for light-duty 
vehicles and 17 for heavy-duty vehicles. Manufacturers would likely be able to combine vehicle 
models into “air conditioning families,” and conduct fewer than 1,250 tests for light-duty 
vehicles. However, it is unclear how many models could be grouped together, so we are 
including costs for all fuel economy tests. We also view these estimates as conservatively high 
because the test is not likely to take a full hour to run and the analysis assumes no excess test 
facility capacity currently exists for manufacturers. 
There are no facilities or equipment costs associated with CO2 because manufacturers 
already measure CO2. This is also the case for CH4 for light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, 
and locomotives. Also, there are no facility or equipment costs associated with A/C system
scoring (leakage evaluation), since this would be based on system components and design 
analysis rather than testing. 
For each manufacturer, we have also included an estimated cost to account for 
information technology (IT) system modifications that may be needed to process the new 
emissions test data being collected. As mentioned above, the test data collection and processing 
is often highly automated. We have based the cost on 40 hours of IT staff time at $100 per hour 
for each manufacturer, except for light-duty manufacturers where we have estimated 80 hours of 
4-109 

  
 
  
  
    
     
   
  
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
      
 
IT staff time, due to the higher number of test cells per manufacturer and the need to process A/C 
data and information. 
We have amortized the costs for the test facility and equipment upgrades described above 
over a 10-year recovery period using an amortization rate of 7% in our analysis. We believe that 
this approach reasonably accounts for the lifecycle of testing facilities and equipment. Also, 
these costs are projected to occur 1 year prior to the start of the program (manufacturers would 
need to install equipment and upgrade facilities ahead of and in preparation for the beginning of 
the reporting requirements) and the costs are adjusted using the 7% rate of return to reflect the 
time value of money. This methodology allows us to estimate an overall annualized cost, an 
average annual cost per manufacturer, and an average per vehicle or engine cost. Table 4-78 
provides the estimated number of test cells and the total annualized facility costs for each mobile 
source category.

4.40.4 O&M Costs: A/C Idle Test Operating Costs 
For light-duty vehicle A/C CO2 testing, manufacturers would incur a per test cost for the 
time necessary to conduct the new idle CO2 test. This is in addition to the facility costs estimated 
above, and accounts for the operation and maintenance costs associated with running the test. We
have added $60 per hour for each A/C idle test to account for operating costs, for a total annual 
cost of about $27,000 for light-duty vehicles and $1,000 for heavy-duty vehicles. There would be 
no additional O&M costs associated with other emissions measurements being proposed because
these measurements would be done during tests already performed by manufacturers as part of 
current emissions testing requirements. 
4.40.5 Total Aggregate Annualized Costs, and Average Per Manufacturer and Per Unit Costs 
We estimated total annualized costs for each category and for mobile sources as a whole 
by summing the costs described above. We estimated per manufacturer average costs by dividing 
the annualized aggregate costs by the estimated number of manufacturers in each category, and 
per unit costs by dividing by the estimated annual sales for each category from the certification 
databases. Table 4-79 provides a summary of the costs described above and Table 4-80 provides 
the aggregate costs, average per manufacturer, and average per unit cost estimates. The aggregate 
costs by category vary depending primarily on the new requirements for each category, and the 
number of manufacturers, engine families, and test cells for each category. The costs are minimal 
relative to the typical costs for emissions certification. The total annualized cost for mobile 
sources is estimated to be about $7.4 million.

4.41 Summary 
Tables 4-81 and 4-82 present summary estimates of the impacts of the rule under the four 
thresholds. Table 4-81 shows, for each subpart at each threshold, the number and share of entities 
and emissions covered by the proposed rule. Table 4-82 summarizes the national costs and costs 
per representative entity for each subpart and each threshold.
As shown in Table 4-81, at lower thresholds a higher number and share of facilities and 
emissions are covered by the proposed rule. As the threshold increases, smaller numbers and 
shares of entities and emissions are affected. At the 1,000 MT threshold, half of the 40 subparts 
report that 100% of the entities and/or 100% of the emissions are covered. At this threshold, the 
median share of entities and emissions is 100%; however, the Manure Management subpart has 
fewer than 5% of entities covered—even at the lowest threshold—and less than 15% of 
emissions covered. At the proposed 25,000 MT threshold, on the other hand, only 17 subparts 
have 100% of entities covered, and only 13 subparts have 100% of emissions covered. The 
median share of entities covered has fallen to 92%, although the median share of emissions

covered remains 100%. The manure management subpart again has the lowest share of entities 
covered (less than 1%) and only 3% of emissions covered. At the highest threshold (100,000 
MT), only five subparts have 100% of entities covered and only six subparts have 100% of 
emissions covered. At this threshold, five subparts have less than 1% of entities covered. The 
median share of entities covered has fallen to 66%, but the median share of emissions covered 
remains high at 98%. 
Table 4-82 presents the costs of compliance for each subpart at each threshold. The first 
eight columns report subsets of costs, including costs associated with processes (labor, 
annualized capital, and operating and maintenance costs), costs associated with wastewater 
treatment, costs associated with landfills, costs associated with reporting electricity usage, costs 
associated with reporting and recordkeeping, and costs associated with stationary combustion. 
The final four columns report total national costs and total per-entity costs for the first year and 
for subsequent years. (Because the first year entails added compliance activities, relative to 
subsequent years, many subparts have higher costs in the first year relative to subsequent years). 
As described in Table 4-81, at lower thresholds, a larger number of entities in each subpart are 
covered by the proposed rule, and thus incur costs. For this reason, the total national costs, and 
total costs by cost subset, decline as the threshold increases from 1,000 MT to 10,000 MT, to 
25,000 MT, and finally to 100,000 MT. First year national costs, for example, range from $426 
million at the 1,000 MT threshold, to $218 million at the 10,000 MT threshold, to $160 million 
at the 25,000 MT threshold, to $101 million at the 100,000 MT threshold. Cost per representative 
entity for a particular subpart generally remains the same or declines slightly from lower 
thresholds to higher ones; however, it varies considerably from subpart to subpart.

Across thresholds, some subsets of costs are typically larger (process, combustion) 
compared to other subsets (electricity usage, reporting and recordkeeping). Entities in some
subparts incur higher costs relative to other subparts, regardless of the threshold. The subparts 
incurring higher costs of compliance in general are stationary combustion, pulp and paper 
manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, and oil and natural gas systems.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2006 are 7.1 billion MtCO2e. As shown in 
Table 5-1, the total national emissions covered under the recommended option are 3.9 billion 
MtCO2e. The majority of these covered emissions are from the electricity generation units 
covered by ARP (2.3 billion MtCO2e). Adding upstream fuel suppliers emissions would increase 
this estimate by approximately 30% but would also double-count an unknown fraction of 
downstream emissions.10 
10While the fraction of overlap is unknown, it is estimated in Section 5.1.7.

Although the majority of cost and emissions information reported in this economic and 
small entity analysis is organized by subpart, EPA mapped each subpart to an industry included 
in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) so that they could be used in 
conjunction with economic census data. Since several subparts contain NAICS codes that fall 
into different sectors, they may appear in multiple sectors. For example, Subpart PP (suppliers of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) include facilities with NAICS that fall into oil and natural gas 
transportation (NAICS 486), chemical manufacturing (NAICS 325), and oil and gas extraction 
(NAICS 211). 
As shown in Table 5-2, the total national costs for the recommended option are estimated 
to be $168 million in the first year and $134 million in subsequent years ($2006). More than 90% 
of these costs fall on the private sector. Sectors bearing the greatest share of the ongoing costs of 
the rule are oil and natural gas systems (21%), general station combustion (18%), and iron and 
steel production (11%).

In addition to total national costs by sector under the recommended option, we also report 
average cost per ton to support additional analysis of the mandatory reporting programs. The 
average ongoing private cost per metric ton of CO2e reported is $0.03. This measure varies by 
sector; measures range from less than $0.01 per ton (e.g., electricity generation [ARP]) to $0.63 
per ton (electronics manufacturing). 
5.1 Evaluating Alternative Options for Implementation of the Rule 
The recommended option was evaluated based on a cost-effectiveness analysis. This 
approach compares the benefits and costs of alternative options for the rule. For example, in 
selecting the emissions threshold, we compared the incremental emissions reported with the 
incremental costs (associated with the change in the facilities that would be required to report 
their emissions). Similarly, in selecting the reporting methodology option, we compared the 
change in uncertainty with the change in costs associated with different emission 
measurement/estimation techniques. The metrics used and the results of the cost-effectiveness 
analysis are discussed below. A discussion of the number of reporters, methods, and cost 
assumptions associated with the alternative options is presented in the cost appendix 
(Appendix A) and in the Technical Support Documents (TSDs).  
Ten alternative options were evaluated for this analysis. While we believe these 10 
alternatives represent the most likely variations in the selected option, we recognize that in some
cases particular interests may wish to evaluate more nuanced alternative options. To maintain 
transparency in the analysis, all of the data necessary to conduct further alternative option 
analyses can be found in Tables 4-81 and 4-82, specific industrial subsections in Section 4 of this 
document and in the cost appendix to the RIA. For example, if you wanted to change the 
coverage of fuel suppliers or the downstream coverage of specific fuels, such as natural gas or 
coal, you would evaluate the appropriate subparts for these fuels and using the data in cost 
appendix to the RIA or in Tables 4-81 – 4-82 
5.1.1 Analysis of Alternative Threshold Options 
The threshold, in large part, determines the number of entities required to report GHG 
emissions under the rule. The higher the threshold, the more entities that are excluded. It is 
assumed that the per unit/entity cost does not change at different thresholds so that changes in the 
national cost estimates are driven by the number of reporting entities. The per unit/entity costs 
outlined in Section 4, along with the estimates of numbers of covered entities at various 
thresholds, form the basis for this analysis. Two metrics are used to evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of the emissions threshold. The first is the average cost per ton of emissions 
5-5 

  
 
   
 
 
   
    
     
  
 
reported. The second metric for evaluating the threshold option is the marginal cost of reported 
emissions ($/ton CO2E). To compute this metric, we compute the change in emissions reported 
by lowering or raising the threshold and divide this by the change in total reporting costs. 
Table 5-3 provides the cost-effectiveness analysis for the various thresholds. Throughout the 
alternative threshold option analysis, the analysis will typically report and compare differences in 
private costs because public costs do not vary with the alternative. The one exception is option 9, 
and in this case changes in private and public costs are reported. As shown in Table 5-3, the total 
average cost per ton for the recommended hybrid option of 25,000 tons CO2e is approximately 
$0.04 (first year). As the threshold increases, the number of covered entities decreases, as does 
the total cost and the emissions covered, although not at the same rate. As a result, the total 
average cost per ton decreases from $0.04 to $0.03.

The analysis also shows that the marginal cost (reduction) of moving from the 
recommended threshold of 25,000 tons CO2e to a higher threshold (100,000 tons) is $0.35 per 
ton and decreases the total emissions captured by approximately 3%. Similarly, the marginal cost 
of moving the threshold from 25,000 to 10,000 is $1.16 per ton and increases the emissions 
captured by 1%. Finally, the marginal cost of lowering the threshold from 10,000 to 1,000 yields 
the highest cost increase in marginal cost reported ($3.29 per ton), and increases the percentage 
of covered emissions by less than 1%. Similar data is presented for subsequent year in Table 5-4. 
Information on how costs are distributed across sectors at each threshold are provided in the 
following tables: Table 5-5 (1,000 tCO2e threshold), Table 5-6 (10,000 tCO2e threshold), Table

The selection decision weighed the marginal cost of capturing additional emissions with 
the percentage of emissions needed to accurately estimate the U.S. GHG emissions nationally 
and by sector. This is shown in Figure 5-1, which illustrates the total average cost per ton and the 
marginal cost per ton as a function of the percentage of total emissions reported. 
In addition to the typical emissions thresholds associated with GHG reporting and 
reduction programs (e.g., 25,000 metric tons CO2e), under the CAA, there are (1) the Title V 
program that requires all major stationary sources with emissions over 100 tons per year (tpy) to 
hold an operating permit and (2) the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source 
Review (NSR) program that requires new major sources and major sources that are undergoing 
major modifications to obtain a permit. A major source for NSR/PSD is defined as any source 
that emits or has the potential to emit either 100 tpy or 250 tpy of a regulated pollutant, 
dependent on the source category and attainment status of the area. The 100 tpy level is the level 
at which existing sources in 28 industry categories listed in the CAA are classified as major for 
the PSD program. The 250 tpy level is the level at which existing sources in all other categories 
are classified as major for PSD purposes.

Figure 5-1. Average and Marginal Cost per Ton of Emissions Reported by Threshold 
EPA performed some preliminary analyses to generally estimate the existing stock of 
major sources in order to then estimate the approximate number of new facilities that could be
required to obtain NSR/PSD permits. EPA roughly estimated that currently approximately 
350,000 facilities have emissions greater than 100 tons per year, while approximately 235,000 
have more than 250 tons per year. If the 100 and 250 tpy thresholds were applied in the context 
of GHGs, the Agency estimates the number of PSD permits required to be issued each year 
would increase by a factor greater than 10 (i.e., more than 2,000 to 3,000 permits per year). The 
5-13 

  
additional permits would generally be issued to smaller industrial sources, as well as large office 
and residential buildings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facilities. EPA rejected 
setting similar reporting thresholds in this proposal due to the uncertainty in the estimates in the 
number of affected facilities and the additional burden likely placed on a large number of small 
sources. 
It should be noted that the estimates in the ANPR of sources that would be required to 
report are rough estimates and are not as robust as the threshold analysis performed for this 
proposed rule. In addition, even if we assumed the per facility costs were the same, a threshold 
significantly lower than the 25,000 ton hybrid threshold would dramatically increase the cost of 
the rule overall and more than likely impose significant small business impacts. 
5.1.2 Analysis of Alternative Monitory Method Options 
Each monitoring technique for which reporting costs were estimated in Section 4 is 
expected to provide the same level of emissions coverage. However, the different methods of 
monitoring emissions differ in their accuracy in estimating actual emissions. Therefore, the gain 
from increasing the cost of monitoring is to have more precise estimates of facility emissions. 
The methods considered for determining emissions ranged from applying average industry 
parameters (referred to as “default parameters”) to material inputs or throughputs, to the use of 
CEMS to directly measure emissions. As discussed previously, the selected option (referred to as 
the “hybrid method”) requires the use of CEMS if they are already required for other regulations; 
otherwise, facility-specific measurements are made to support calculations of GHG emissions. In 
this section, we evaluate the change in cost and change in accuracy for two alternative 
monitoring options. Generally speaking, under one of the alternatives, default parameters would 
be used in lieu of CEMS and facility-level estimates, and in the other options, CEMS are 
required for all sources. We use the term “CEMS” and “default parameters” as shorthand to 
describe alternative options. Estimated costs for each monitoring method are shown in Table 5-8. 
To compute the cost for the CEMS option, we multiply the recommended option costs by 
a ratio of Tier 4 costs ($56,040 in the first year and $31, 325 in subsequent years) to Tier 2 costs 
($5,500 in both first and subsequent years). This ratio is estimated to be 10.2 in the first year and 
5.7 in subsequent years . The Tier 4 option applies to non-Part 75, non-EGU (industrial) units 
where O2 analyzers will not suffice (e.g., sources with process emissions [cement, lime, glass]) 
and requires adding a CO2 analyzer and flow meter (see discussion in Section 4). For the Tier 2 
methodology, CO2 mass emissions are estimated using measured high heat values, a default CO2 
5-14 

 emission factor, a default oxidation factor, and the quantity of fuel combusted. Default CH4 and 
N2O emission factors and measure heat content (see stationary combustion TSD). 
For the default parameter options, we use a ratio of Tier 1 costs ($2,200 in both first and 
subsequent years) to Tier 2 costs ($5,500 in both first and subsequent years), or 0.40 in both first 
and subsequent years. The Tier 1 method includes calculation with fuel-specific default emission 
factors, a default high heating value, a default oxidation factor, and the annual fuel consumption. 
Measurement of annual fuel consumption is assumed to be a standard business practice and not 
included in incremental cost of the GHG monitoring (see stationary combustion TSD). First year 
costs include a monitoring plan and a QA/QC plan. 
EPA contract engineers also developed uncertainty estimates for all three methods for 
each affected sector. The uncertainties in individual measurements were based on quoted 
accuracies of the instruments or engineering judgment. These individual measurement 
uncertainties were assumed to represent 95% confidence intervals. Uncertainties in the overall 
method were determined via error propagation or Monte Carlo assessment and reported as the 
95% confidence interval about the mean or expected value (as a percentage of that value).  
5.1.2.1 Monitoring Method Uncertainty 
For 10 of the top GHG emitting sectors, engineering experts were asked to provide 
uncertainty values for the three methodologies being considered. This information is shown in 
Table 5-9. Whereas the CEMS approach is constant at 7%, the uncertainty for the engineering 
and hybrid methods varies considerably across sectors. The highest uncertainty was associated 
with using the engineering estimate method to estimate emissions in industrial gas 
manufacturing. For the industrial gas sector, applying the default parameter approach requires 
measuring production flows accurately and calculating the flow difference to estimate emissions. 
However, while the uncertainty in the production flow measurement can be as low as 0.5%, this 
yields a 50% uncertainty in the difference (emissions) if losses are on the order of 1% of 
production. 
In general, the uncertainty cost-effectiveness analysis was useful in selecting the 
recommended hybrid methodology and was evaluated in conjunction with other considerations 
such as consistency with other regulations and the burden on small entities. 
To evaluate the trade-off between cost and uncertainty across the alternative methods, 
three measures (i.e., metrics) of cost-effectiveness were developed.

1. 	 Incremental cost. This is the total national private cost difference between the options. 
For example, as illustrated in Tables 5-10 and 5-11, by moving from the 
recommended hybrid method to CEMS, the total national cost increases by $1,474 
million for the first year and $597 million for subsequent years.11 
2. 	 Average cost per percentage point uncertainty. This compares the average cost per 
percentage point uncertainty across the three alternative methods. For example, the 
cost for the recommended hybrid method is ($160M/9.4) = $17.1M per percentage 
point uncertainty. The average cost for the CEMS and default parameter approaches 
are ($1,634M/7.0) = 234M and ($64M/19.7) = 3.3M, respectively.  
3. 	 Marginal cost per percentage point reduction in uncertainty. This compares the cost
of reducing the coefficient of variation by 1%. For example, the incremental cost per 
percent point in going from a default parameter approach to a hybrid approach is 
$96M/(19.7–9.4) = $9.3M, and the incremental cost of moving from a hybrid 
approach to an approach where CEMS are used is $M1,474/(9.4–7.0) = $614M. 
11To compute the cost for the CEMS option, we multiply the recommended option costs by a ratio of Tier 4 costs 
($33,804) to Tier 2 costs ($5,500), or 6.15. For the default parameter options, we use a ratio of Tier 1 costs 
($2,200) to Tier 2 costs, or 0.40.

5.1.3 EPA Uses Existing Federal Data for Fuel Quantity (Option 2a) 
Under this scenario, upstream fuel suppliers (Subparts KK, MM, NN), would not be 
required to report their fuel quantity data to EPA. Rather than collecting this information from
upstream fuel suppliers, the EPA would access the quantity data each fuel supplier is currently 
reporting to other federal agencies such as EIA. The reduction in cost from this option is a result 
of fuel suppliers not having to duplicate the reporting of their fuel quantity data. However, most 
other costs will stay the same because suppliers currently do not test for carbon content and 
because they will still have to report fuel quality (i.e., carbon content) directly to EPA. It is 
assumed that the accuracy and coverage of reported emissions for fuel suppliers would be 
unchanged under this scenario.

EPA estimates that this would result in a labor savings of 2 hours for each reporting 
entity, yielding a decreased private sector cost of $0.3 million.
(3,005 entities) × (2 hrs/entity) × (57 $/hr) = $342,570 
However, there likely would be an increased cost to the public sector resulting from the 
EPA need to obtain data from EIA and integrate the data with the fuel quality information 
obtained from the GHG mandatory reporting rule. In addition, this task will be complicated by 
issues related to maintaining data confidentiality, as discussed in the preamble. As a result, it is 
unclear whether this option will result in a net decrease in total national costs of the program.
5.1.4 EPA Uses Default Carbon Content for Fuel Suppliers (Option 2b)  
Under this scenario, the only change to the recommended approach is that fuel suppliers 
(Subparts KK, MM, NN), are only required to report their downstream emissions. EPA would 
use default carbon content parameters for its analysis. Under this scenario, the fuel suppliers’ 
first year costs would decrease from $15.2 million to zero. However, this change would increase 
the uncertainty of the emissions estimate from 4% to 6% (see Section 6 for a discussion of 
uncertainty estimates).

emissions uncertainty for fuel suppliers. This yields a marginal cost of uncertainty of  
$15.2 million / 51.3 MtCO2e = 0.30$/tCO2e 
5.1.5 Frequency of Reporting: Quarterly 
The recommended reporting frequency is annually, unless entities are already required to 
report quarterly. Under this scenario, all entities are required to report quarterly. To compute the 
cost of the rule under a quarterly reporting scenario, we assume these costs increase 
proportionally for each sector and used a ratio of quarterly to annual costs derived from the oil, 
gas, and mining engineering cost analysis to scale each sector’s recommended option costs.12 
This ratio was estimated to be 2.0 and primarily reflects the increased labor costs associated with 
monitoring and reporting activities. As a result, quarterly reporting would lead to an increase in 
the total annual private sector cost from $160 million to $320 million in the first year and from
$127 million to $254 million in subsequent years.
12Currently, this is the only industry sector available in the analysis that produced both quarterly and annual 
reporting cost estimates. Under the recommended option, oil, gas, and mining sectors report annually.

It is unclear what impact this would have on the accuracy of reported emissions. In 
industries where processes or fuel inputs are highly variable, increased reporting would help 
document the variability. However, for industries with stable processes, the impact on accuracy 
would likely be minimal. 
5.1.6 Third-Party Verification 
An alternative to having EPA QA/QC self-certified emissions based on information 
provided by reporting entities is to have independent third-party verification. This would lead to 
increased private-sector costs and potentially some reduction in Agency costs. Overall costs to 
society will likely be higher for a third-party verification system than for a government 
verification system because of increased transaction costs and lower economies of scale 
compared to a centralized system. As shown in Table 5-15, private-sector third-party verification 
costs are estimated to be approximately $58 million, compared with public-sector cost (if EPA 
provides verification) of $1.5 million. Table 5-16 compares this alternative with the 
recommended option.

A study conducted by CARB found that third-party verification costs range from $20,000 
per entity for refineries to $2,000 per entity for miscellaneous facilities. The cost information 
was based on self-reported information by approximately 20 facilities. The costs reported by 
CARB were reviewed by RTI engineers and were assessed to be reasonable based on field 
experience. Process-related third-party verification costs varied, but averaged around $5,000 per 
facility. Facilities with stationary combustion sources had the lowest third-party verification 
costs of $2,000 per facility. In analyzing the cost of this option, we assumed that EGUs that must 
report their emissions under the ARP would not be subject to third-party verification requirement 
because their CO2 emissions are already subject to a separate QA/QC process conducted by 
EPA.

Table 5-15 presents the private-sector and public-sector costs by NAICS associated with 
the third-party verification at the 25,000 CO2e threshold. At this threshold, total private-sector 
costs are estimated to increase approximately $58 million, with the greatest costs associated with 
pipeline transportation, mining, and stationary combustion.  
Public-sector (Agency) costs would likely be reduced, but it is unclear what the net 
impact would be. The information collection request (ICR) assumes 2 hours of EPA staff time
per year will be required for EPA review and QA/QC of each report. At a labor rate of $57 per 
hour, this yields a total annual cost of approximately $1.5 million for EPA to review self-
reported emissions. 
5-27 

  
  
   
 
  
 
 
  
     
  
   
 
However, under a third-party verification scenario, the Agency would bear some
additional costs due to certifying verification vendors and managing the verification system. 
Hence, net savings to the Agency would likely be less than the $1.5 million shown above.  
In addition, it is unclear if this scenario would increase the accuracy of GHG reporting. 
Third-party verification would most likely increase the level of detail of the QA/QC process, but 
it is difficult to assess what impact this would have on the accuracy of GHG reporting.  
5.1.7 Only Upstream and Downstream Process Reporting 
Under this scenario, unspecified stationary sources are not required to report. All other 
sectors are included in the definition of upstream. These include the fuel suppliers, industrial gas 
suppliers, industrial processes, fugitive emissions, biological processes, and vehicle and engine 
manufacturers sectors. Since the reporting thresholds and reporting requirements remain the 
same for the upstream sources, the cost estimates for sectors remain unchanged. Table 5-17 
compares this alternative with the recommended option and shows that the private costs of the 
rule fall from $160 million to $110.5 million in the first year and fall from $127 million to $87.6 
million in subsequent years. Alternative 10, first year annualized costs per metric fall from the 
first $0.04 to $0.03. In subsequent years, annualized cost per metric ton fall from $0.03 baseline 
to $0.02.

scenario. We also report estimates of the extent to which upstream/downstream emissions may 
be counted more than once (Table 5-19). It should be noted that for all sources the coverage is 
defined as the percentage of emissions covered for that source category, except for vehicle and 
engine manufacturers where the coverage is defined as the percentage of manufacturers reporting 
out of all vehicle and engine manufacturers.

Notes: 
1 Most upstream facilities (e.g., coal mines, refineries) are also direct emitters of greenhouse gases, and are included in the 
downstream side of the table. 
2 Estimating the total number of downstream reporters by summing the rows will result in double-counting because some 
facilities are included in more than one row due to multiple types of emissions (e.g., facilities that burn fossil fuel and have 
process/fugitive/biological emissions will be included in each downstream category). 
3 The coverage and costs for downstream reporters apply to the specific source category, i.e., the fixed costs are not “double­
counted” in both stationary combustion and industrial processes for the same facility.
4 The thresholds used to determine covered facilities are additive, i.e., all of the source categories located at a facility (e.g.,
stationary combustion and process emissions) are added together to determine whether a facility meets the proposed
threshold (e.g., 25,000 metric tons of CO2e/yr).
5 Estimates for the number of reporters and total cost for downstream stationary combustion do not distinguish between fuels. 
National level data on the number of reporters could be estimated. However, estimating the number of reporters by fuel was 
not possible because a single facility can combust multiple fuels. For these reasons there is not a reliable estimate of the total 
of the emissions coverage from the downstream stationary combustion. 
6 Approximately 90% of downstream coal combustion emissions are already reported to EPA through requirements for electricity
generating units under the Acid Rain Program. 
7 Due to data limitations, the coverage for downstream sources for fuel and industrial gas consumption in this table does not take 
into account thresholds. Assuming full emissions coverage for each source slightly over-states the actual coverage that 
would result from this rule. To estimate total emissions coverage downstream, by fuel, we added total emissions resulting 
from the respective fuel combusted in the industrial and electricity generation sectors and divided that by total national GHG 
emissions from the combustion of that fuel.

8 The percent of coverage here is percentage of vehicle and engine manufacturers covered by this proposal rather than emissions 
coverage. This rule proposes to collect an emissions rate for the four “transportation-related” GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, 
N2O and HFCs). The amounts of CH4 and N2O are dependent on factors other than fuel characteristics such as combustion 
temperatures, air-fuel mixes, and use of pollution control equipment.  
9 The emissions coverage for petroleum combustion includes combustion of fuel by transportation sources as well as other uses
of petroleum (e.g., home heating oil). It cannot be broken out by transportation versus other uses as there are difficulties
associated with tracking which products from petroleum refiners are used for transportation fuel and which were not. We 
know that although refiners make these designations for the products leaving their gate, the actual end use can and does 
change in the market. For example, designated transportation fuel can always be used as home heating oil. 
10 Emissions coverage from the combustion of fossil fuels upstream represents CO2 emissions only. It is not possible to estimate 
nitrous oxide and methane emissions without knowing where and how the fuel is combusted. In the case of downstream 
emissions from stationary combustion of fossil fuels, nitrous oxide and methane emissions are included in the emissions
coverage estimate. They represent approximately 1% of the total emissions.

1 Due to data limitations, the coverage for downstream sources for fuel and industrial gas consumption in this table does not take 
into account thresholds. Assuming full emissions coverage for each source slightly over-states the actual coverage that would
result from this rule. 
2 Estimates for the number of reporters and total cost for downstream stationary combustion do not distinguish between fuels. 
National level data on the number of reporters could be estimated. However, estimating the number of reporters by fuel was 
not possible because a single facility can combust multiple fuels.
3 The total emissions covered from upstream fuel suppliers is based on the applicability requirements in the preamble that all 
producers of coal, petroleum and industrial gas, as well as LDCs and natural gas processing plants would be required to report 
to the rule. Further, all importers of fossil fuels, and industrial gas importers with potential emissions greater than 25,000 
mtCO2e would be required to report. This means, 100% of potential emissions from coal, petroleum and industrial gas would 
be included. For natural gas, potential emissions from LDCs and gas processing plants represent about 68% of the total 
emissions from natural gas consumption in the United States.  
In the case of downstream coverage, for coal consumption we assume we capture 99% of emissions, because we will get 
reporting for all coal consumed in the commercial, industrial, and electricity generating sectors. For natural gas and petroleum 
consumption, we assume that we capture all gas consumed in the electricity generation sector, as well as some industrial 
consumption. The percentages are based on reviewing data in Table 3-3 of the U.S. GHG Inventory 1990-2008.  
For downstream emissions from industrial gases, we believe we are capturing emissions of these industrial gases from HCFC­
22 production, magnesium production, semiconductor manufacturing, aluminum production, SF6 from electrical equipment, 
CO2 consumption, and N2O product uses. The downstream emissions from these sources can be found in Table ES-2 of the 
U.S. GHG Inventory 1990-2008 and represent 28% of emissions of these gases.  
5-30 

  
 
 
The coverage and costs for downstream reporters apply to the specific source category;
therefore, fixed costs are not “double-counted” in both stationary combustion and industrial 
processes for the same facility. An important aspect of this scenario is that some process related 
emissions may not be captured due to the fact that downstream combustion sources would not be 
covered by the rule. A source with process emission plus combustion emissions would only have 
to report their process emission, thus the exclusion of downstream combustion could result in 
some sources being under the threshold.  
5.1.8 Sensitivity of Subsequent Year Cost Estimates 
National cost estimates for the recommended option were developed based on the current 
population of entities. Whereas production in some of the affected sectors may increase or 
decrease over time, it was assumed that the number of entities would remain relatively constant. 
Thus, the analysis assumes a stable population where all entities bear a single first-year cost and 
then repeated subsequent-year costs.
Due to data limitations, the coverage for downstream sources for fuel and industrial gas 
consumption in this table does not take into account thresholds. Assuming full emissions 
coverage for each source slightly over-states the actual coverage that would result from this rule. 
However, in reality, over time some existing entities close or go out of business and new entities 
come into existence. This is sometimes referred to as entry and exit in an industry. This affects 
the cost of the rule because as entities “turn over” the new entrants will bear first-year costs that 
are slightly higher than subsequent year costs. To assess the impact of this dynamic, we 
performed a case study analysis on selected industries in order to identify the average share of 
new establishments in an industry each year. 
To conduct the sensitivity analysis we recomputed subsequent year costs accounting for 
the number of new entities census data (SBA, 2008b) suggest come into existence each year (that 
face first-year costs). For example, in the oil and gas extraction section, 9% of the firms in any 
given year are new to the industry (and hence will bear first-year costs). Thus, the adjusted 
subsequent-year costs are computed as 
(0.09) × First-Year Costs + (1 − 0.09) × (Subsequent Year Costs) 
As shown in Table 5-20, this leads to a 1.4% increase in the subsequent-year cost 
estimate for the oil and gas extraction section. 
5-31 

  
                                                 
 
We identified an estimate of each industry’s new establishment share using data from the 
U.S. Census Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) program (SBA, 2008b). They provide an 
annual series that include the number of new establishments by industry.13 Since this data is 
organized by NAICS, we utilized the Subpart-to-NAICS mapping provided in Table 5-2 to 
determine the appropriate costs to use for each NAICS industry. Using the share data in 
Table 5-20, we find that the subsequent-year costs are on average 2.3% higher when entry and 
exit of entities are taken into account. This table also lists the specific subparts utilized in 
estimating the costs associated with each NAICS. In some cases, it was difficult to estimate the 
total costs associated with each NAICS, because some subparts are mapped to several different 
NAICS codes and it was unclear the portion of costs associated with each. In these cases, a 
representative subpart was chosen.  
Because of uncertainty in the future entry and exit across industries, we also performed 
similar calculations assuming the shares in Table 5-20 were 2% higher or lower. Under this 
assumption, subsequent-year costs are 2.8% higher and 1.8% higher under each case. 
Consistent with the appropriations language regarding reporting of emissions from
“upstream production,” EPA is proposing reporting requirements from upstream suppliers of 
fossil fuel and industrial GHGs. In the context of GHG reporting, “upstream emissions” refers to 
the GHG emissions potential of a quantity of industrial gas or fossil fuel supplied into the 
economy. For fossil fuels, the emissions potential is the amount of CO2 that would be produced 
from complete combustion or oxidation of the carbon in the fuel. In many cases, the fossil fuels 
and industrial GHGs supplied by producers and importers are used and ultimately emitted by a 
large number of small sources, particularly in the commercial and residential sectors (e.g., HFCs 
emitted from home A/C units or GHG emissions from individual motor vehicles). To cover these 
direct emissions would require reporting by hundreds or thousands of small facilities. To avoid 
this impact, the proposed rule does not include all of those emitters, but instead requires 
reporting by the suppliers of industrial gases and suppliers of fossil fuels. Because the GHGs in 
these products are almost always fully emitted during use, reporting these supply data will 
provide an estimate of national emissions while substantially reducing the number of reporters. 
For this reason, the proposed rule requires reporting by suppliers of coal and coal-based 
products, petroleum products, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), CO2 gas, and other 
industrial GHGs.

5.1.9 Summary of Alternative Threshold Options 
Although, the recommended option is not the least cost option (option 3, 6, 7, and 10 are 
less expensive), the option provides additional benefits in terms of coverage and certainty of 
emissions reporting that these other options do not (see Table 5-21). For example, the higher 
reporting threshold under option 3 provides less emissions coverage than the recommended 
option. Option 5 offers similar coverage but analysis presented in 5.1.2 suggests emission 
estimation will be less precise. Option 6 provides only small cost labor savings (approximately 
0.3 million). However, the increased cost to the public sector resulting integrating the data with 
the fuel quality information and issues related to maintaining data confidentiality makes it 
unclear whether this option will result in a net decrease in total national costs of the program.
Under Option 7, the fuel suppliers’ first year costs would decrease from $15 million to zero but 
uncertainty of the emissions estimate increases from 4% to 6%. Under option 10, some process 
related emissions may not be captured due to the fact that downstream combustion sources 
would not be covered by the rule. Source with process emission plus combustion emissions 
would only have to report their process emission, thus the exclusion of downstream combustion 
could result in some sources being under the threshold.

5.2 Assessing Economic Impacts on Small Entities 
The first step in this assessment was to determine whether the rule will have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities (SISNOSE). To make this determination, EPA 
used a screening analysis that allows us to indicate whether EPA can certify the rule as not 
having a SISNOSE. The elements of this analysis included 
 identifying affected sectors and entities, 
 selecting and describing the measures and economic impact thresholds used in the 
analysis, and 
 determining SISNOSE certification category.

5.2.1 Identify Affected Sectors and Entities 
The industry sectors covered by the rule were identified during the development of the 
cost analysis for the reporting rule. The SUSB data provide national information on the 
distribution of economic variables by industry and size.14 These data were developed in 
cooperation with, and partially funded by, the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) (SBA, 2008a). The data include the number of establishments 
(Table 5-22), employment (Table 5-23), and receipts (Table 5-24) and present information on all
entities in an industry covered by the rule; however, many of these entities would not be 
expected to report under the preferred option because they would fall below the 25,000 hybrid 
threshold. SUSB also provides this data by enterprise employment size. The census definitions in 
this data set are as follows: 
 establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 
conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.  
 employment: Paid employment consists of full- and part-time employees, including 
salaried officers and executives of corporations, who were on the payroll in the pay 
period including March 12. Included are employees on sick leave, holidays, and 
vacations; not included are proprietors and partners of unincorporated businesses. 
 receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes. 
 enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated
establishments. 
Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008c) apply to an establishment’s “ultimate 
parent company,” we assume in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses and the terms are used interchangeably. 
We also report the SBA size standard(s) for each industry group in order to facilitate 
comparisons and different thresholds.  
14The SUSB data does not provide establishment information for agricultural NAICS codes (e.g., NAICS 112 which 
covers Manure Management). However, the per entity costs are small (less than $1,000 per year) and EPA 
believes the ultimate parent companies of entities covered are not small businesses.

a The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. 
b Given the Agency’s selected thresholds, enterprises with fewer than 20 employees are likely to be excluded from the reporting program.  
c NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122—A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric 
energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. NAICS 221210= 500 employees.
d 500 to 1,500. For NAICS code 324110—For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner must be a concern that has no more than 1,500 employees nor more than 125,000 barrels per 
calendar day total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an 
exchange agreement or a throughput. The total product to be delivered under the contract must be at least 90% refined by the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks.
e NAICS codes 486110 = 1,500 employees; NAICS 486210=$6.5 million annual receipts; NAICS 486910 = 1,500 employees; and NAICS 486990 =$11.5 million annual receipts. 
f Ranges from $6.5 to $13.0 million annual receipts; Environmental Remediation services has a 500 employee definition and the following criteria. NAICS 562910—Environmental Remediation 
Services: 
a) For SBA assistance as a small business concern in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for Government procurement, a concern must be engaged primarily in furnishing 
a range of services for the remediation of a contaminated environment to an acceptable condition including, but not limited to, preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial 
investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment, remedial action, removal of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials and security and site closeouts. If one of such 
activities accounts for 50% or more of a concern’s total revenues, employees, or other related factors, the concern’s primary industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental 
Remediation Services Industry.
b) For purposes of classifying a Government procurement as Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore a contaminated environment and also the 
procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., engineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with 
separate, distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to, separate activities in industries such as: Heavy Construction; Special Trade Construction; Engineering Services; 
Architectural Services; Management Services; Refuse Systems; Sanitary Services, Not Elsewhere Classified; Local Trucking Without Storage; Testing Laboratories; and Commercial, Physical and 
Biological Research. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 
50% or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard.
NA: Not available. SUSB did not report this data for disclosure or other reasons.

a The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. 
b Given the Agency’s selected thresholds, enterprises with fewer than 20 employees are likely to be excluded from the reporting program.  
c NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122—A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric 
energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. NAICS 221210=500 employees.
d 500 to 1,500. For NAICS code 324110—For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner must be a concern that has no more than 1,500 employees nor more than 125,000 barrels per 
calendar day total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an 
exchange agreement or a throughput. The total product to be delivered under the contract must be at least 90% refined by the successful bidder 
from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks.
e NAICS codes 486110 = 1,500 employees; NAICS 486210=$6.5 million annual receipts; NAICS 486910 = 1,500 employees; and NAICS 486990 =$11.5 million annual receipts. 
f Ranges from $6.5 to $13.0 million annual receipts; Environmental Remediation services has a 500 employee definition and the following criteria. NAICS 562910—Environmental Remediation 
Services: 
a) For SBA assistance as a small business concern in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for Government procurement, a concern must be engaged primarily in furnishing 
a range of services for the remediation of a contaminated environment to an acceptable condition including, but not limited to, preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial 
investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment, remedial action, removal of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials and security and site closeouts. If one of such 
activities accounts for 50% or more of a concern’s total revenues, employees, or other related factors, the concern’s primary industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental 
Remediation Services Industry.
b) For purposes of classifying a Government procurement as Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore a contaminated environment and also the 
procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., engineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with 
separate, distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to, separate activities in industries such as: Heavy Construction; Special Trade Construction; Engineering Services; 
Architectural Services; Management Services; Refuse Systems; Sanitary Services, Not Elsewhere Classified; Local Trucking Without Storage; Testing Laboratories; and Commercial, Physical and 
Biological Research. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 
50% or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard.

5.2.2 Develop Small Entity Economic Impact Measures 
Because the rule covers a large number of sectors and primarily covers businesses, the 
analysis generated a set of sales tests (represented as cost-to-receipt ratios)15 for NAICS codes 
associated with the affected sectors. Although the appropriate SBA size definition should be 
applied at the parent company (enterprise) level, data limitations allowed us only to compute and 
compare ratios for a model establishment for six enterprise size ranges (i.e., all categories, 
enterprises with 1 to 20 employees, 20 to 99 employees, 100 to 499 employees, 500 to 999 
employees, and 1,000 to 1,499 employees. This approach allows us to account for differences in 
establishment receipts between large and small enterprises and differences in small business 
definitions across affected industries. It is also a conservative approach, because an 
establishment’s parent company (the “enterprise”) may have other economic resources that could 
be used to cover the costs of the reporting program. 
These sales tests examine the average establishment’s total annualized mandatory 
reporting costs to the average establishment receipts for enterprises within several employment 
categories16 (first year costs: Table 5-25; subsequent year costs: Table 5-26). The average entity 
costs used to compute the sales test are the same across all of these enterprise size categories. As 
a result, the sales-test will overstate the cost-to-receipt ratio for establishments owned by small 
businesses, because the reporting costs are likely lower than average entity estimates provided by 
the engineering cost analysis.  
The rule also covers sectors that could conceptually include entities owned by small 
governments. However, given the uncertainty and data limitations associated with identifying 
and appropriately classifying these entities, we computed a “revenue” test for a model small 
government, where the annualized compliance cost is a percentage of annual government 
revenues (U.S. Census, 2005a and b). For example, from the 2002 Census (in $2006), revenues 
for small governments (counties and municipalities) with populations fewer than 10,000 are $3 
million, and revenues for local governments with populations fewer than 50,000 is $7 million. 
As an upper bound estimate, summing typical per-respondent costs of combustion plus landfills  
15The following metrics for other small entity economic impact measures (if applicable) would potentially include
 Small governments (if applicable): “Revenue” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual
government revenues 
 Small non-profits (if applicable): “Expenditure” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
operating expenses 
16For the one to 20 employee category, we exclude SUSB data for enterprises with zero employees. These 
enterprises did not operate the entire year.

a The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. 
b Given the Agency’s selected thresholds, enterprises with fewer than 20 employees are likely to be excluded from the reporting program.  
c NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122—A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric 
energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. NAICS 221210=500 employees.
d 500 to 1,500. For NAICS code 324110—For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner must be a concern that has no more than 1,500 employees nor more than 125,000 barrels per 
calendar day total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an 
exchange agreement or a throughput. The total product to be delivered under the contract must be at least 90% refined by the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks.
e NAICS codes 486110 = 1,500 employees; NAICS 486210=$6.5 million annual receipts; NAICS 486910 = 1,500 employees; and NAICS 486990 =$11.5 million annual receipts. 
f Ranges from $6.5 to $13.0 million annual receipts; Environmental Remediation services has a 500 employee definition and the following criteria. NAICS 562910—Environmental Remediation 
Services: 
a) For SBA assistance as a small business concern in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for Government procurement, a concern must be engaged primarily in furnishing 
a range of services for the remediation of a contaminated environment to an acceptable condition including, but not limited to, preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial 
investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment, remedial action, removal of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials and security and site closeouts. If one of such 
activities accounts for 50% or more of a concern’s total revenues, employees, or other related factors, the concern’s primary industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental 
Remediation Services Industry.
b) For purposes of classifying a Government procurement as Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore a contaminated environment and also the 
procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., engineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with 
separate, distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to, separate activities in industries such as: Heavy Construction; Special Trade Construction; Engineering Services; 
Architectural Services; Management Services; Refuse Systems; Sanitary Services, Not Elsewhere Classified; Local Trucking Without Storage; Testing Laboratories; and Commercial, Physical and 
Biological Research. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 
50% or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard.
NA: Not available. SUSB did not report the data necessary to calculate this ratio.

plus natural gas suppliers yields a cost of approximately $17,000 per local government in the 
first year. Thus, for the smallest group of local governments (<10,000 people), cost-to-revenue 
ratio would be 0.8%. For the larger group of governments (<50,000 people), the cost-to-revenue 
ratio is 0.3%. 
5.2.3 Results of Screening Analysis  
The Regulatory Flexibility Act generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit enterprises. 
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we 
defined a small entity as (1) a small business, as defined by SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR Part 
121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, 
school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; or (3) a small 
organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and operated and is 
not dominant in its field. 
EPA believes the proposed thresholds maximize the rule coverage with over 85% of U.S. 
emissions reported by approximately 13,205 reporters, while keeping reporting burden to a 
minimum and excluding small emitters. Furthermore, many industry stakeholders with whom
EPA met expressed support for a 25,000 metric ton of CO2e threshold because it sufficiently 
captures the majority of GHG emissions in the United States while excluding smaller facilities 
and sources. For small facilities that are captured by the rule, EPA has proposed simplified 
emission estimation methods where feasible (e.g., stationary combustion equipment under a 
certain rating can use a simplified mass balance approach as opposed to more rigorous direct 
monitoring) to keep the burden of reporting as low as possible. For further detail on the rationale 
for excluding small entities through threshold selection, please see the threshold TSD. 
After considering the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, EPA has 
concluded that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities. As shown in Tables 5-25 and 5-26, the average ratio of annualized reporting 
program costs to receipts of establishments owned by model small enterprises was less than 1% 
for industries presumed likely to have small businesses covered by the reporting program.
5-49 

  
 
 
 
We acknowledge that several enterprise categories have ratios that exceed this threshold 
(e.g., enterprise with one to 20 employees). The following enterprise categories have sales test 
results between 1% and 3% for entities with less than 20 employees: Oil and Gas Extraction 
(211), Pulp & Paper Manufacturing (322), Cement & Other Mineral Production(327), Primary 
Metal Manufacturing (331), Computer & Electronic Product Manufacturing (334), Electronic 
equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing (335), Cement (32731), Glass (3272), Lead 
Production (3314), Lime Manufacturing (327410), Nitric Acid (325311), Phosphoric Acid 
(325312), Pulp & Paper—Pulp Mills (322110), and Zinc Production (3314). 
Below we take a more detailed look at the categories noted above as having sales test 
ratios above 1%. EPA collected information on the entities likely to be covered by the rule for 
the hybrid 25,000 ton threshold as part of the expert sub-group process. This can be broken down 
by a more detailed threshold-based analysis and a more detailed employee-based analysis. 
Threshold-based Analysis of Categories Having Sales Test Ratios Above 1%
Cement (32731)
Comparing facility counts in the proposed rule with Census data can be misleading. The 
Census data almost without exception include a larger number of “establishments” than we know 
to be manufacturing the product, based on EPA bottom up industry analyses. For example, the 
2002 Economic Census suggests that for cement there are 246 establishments, however, 
according to the Portland Cement Association Plant Information Summaries, there are 107 
Portland cement facilities manufacturing cement, and these are the facilities proposed for 
inclusion in the rule. The differences between the Census and the industry publications may be 
due to the way in which Census defines an “establishment.” For example, one cement facility, as 
identified by the PCA that crosses several miles, may actually be multiple “establishments” 
according to Census. 
The cement facilities proposed for inclusion in the rule would be the largest facilities as
identified by the Census. This can be seen through a comparison of the value of shipments (i.e., 
the value of cement produced). Greater than 96% of the product is produced by facilities with 
more than 20 employees. Further, all facilities cross a 25,000 mtCO2 threshold; all but one 
exceed a 100,000 mtCO2 threshold. 
Lime (327410)
Data on the number of lime facilities comes from the USGS Directory of Lime Plants in 
the United States in 2005 (USGS 2006). The Census data identifies fewer lime facilities, likely 
5-50 

  
 
 
 
 
because of the differences in defining a lime facility. Some facilities produce just lime and they 
can be easily identified as part of the lime manufacturing industry. However, a number of 
facilities produced lime as an intermediate product, which is then used as an input to the final 
product (this also happens in the iron and steel industry and pulp and paper). Lime has very 
similar characteristics to cement described above, because of similar manufacturing processes.  
Glass (3272)
For the glass industry, 55 facilities are above a 25,000 ton CO2e threshold. All of these 
facilities are from companies with over 20 employees. All but three facilities are from companies 
with greater than 100 employees. Data for the glass industry were based on the Glass Factory 
Directory 2004 (GFD 2004) and EPA’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) 1998 (EPA 2002). 
Nitric Acid (325311), Phosphoric Acid (325312), Iron and Steel (331112)
There are 45 nitric acid facilities based on a bottom-up industry database under 
development by EPA. This dataset shows that all of these facilities are from companies with over 
20 employees. All but two facilities are from companies with greater than 100 employees. 
Similarly, there are 14 phosphoric acid facilities, all of which are from companies with over 20 
employees. There are 121 iron and steel facilities that exceed the 25,000 metric ton threshold 
(130 total) based on the same database. All of these facilities are from companies with over 20 
employees. Three facilities have fewer than 500 employees.  
Pulp and Paper (322/322110)
The pulp and paper industry encompasses over 5,000 facilities. The thresholds proposed 
in this proposed rule are expected to include less than 10% of the total industry. The proposed 
rule would cover about 425 of the most emissions intensive facilities. Considering that emissions 
may be assumed to be positively correlated to number of employees, it is highly likely that these 
facilities are all over 100 employees. According to the Census, about 27% of facilities are over 
100 employees. According to the preamble all 425 facilities exceed all reviewed thresholds, 
including 100,000 mtCO2e. 
Oil and Gas Extraction (211)
Of the 50 offshore oil and gas platforms, we have information on 32 indicating they are 
well over the 500 employee small business threshold. For the remaining 18, information is not 
available; however, we strongly believe that given the investment required and the information 
available to us, that none of these would be small businesses.

Computer & Electronic Product Manufacturing (334) and Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and
Component Manufacturing (335)
For the electronics industry, 94 facilities are above a 25,000 ton CO2e threshold. The 
smallest of these companies has, as of February 2007, 88 employees. Considering that emissions 
may be assumed to be positively correlated to number of employees, it is highly likely that the 
other facilities that exceed the 25,000 ton CO2e threshold have over 100 employees. Data for the 
electronics industry were based on the semiconductor industry’s World Fab Watch (2007 
edition) and press reports regarding number of employees. 
Zinc Production (3314)
For the zinc industry, there are 5 facilities that exceed the 25,000 ton threshold. These 
facilities are from companies with greater than 500 employees. Data for on the number of zinc 
facilities and production capacity at these facilities were based on the US Geologic Survey 
Mineral Yearbook: Annual Zinc Report and other publicly available information from zinc 
producers. 
Employee-based Analysis of Categories Having Sales Test Ratios Above 1%
Two recent studies by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the Nicholas 
Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University (Pew, 2002; Nicholas Institute, 
2008) show there is a recognized positive correlation between GHG emissions and the number of 
employees: the largest facilities will have the largest amount of emissions. A number of studies 
use the number of employees to help quantify emissions. According to these studies, most small 
manufacturers do not burn sufficient fuel to cross a 10,000 metric ton CO2e threshold. By the 
time a facility uses sufficient energy to exceed these types of thresholds, they are large.
According to the Nicholas Institute study, “If the facility has fewer than 50 employees, 
and no smoke-stack, it will be virtually guaranteed safe passage around any reporting
requirement, regardless of what the industry may be. The vast majority of manufacturing 
industries are not expected to cross a 10,000-ton reporting threshold until the employee count is 
in the hundreds” (Nicholas Institute, 2008). The final conclusion of this study was that a 10,000 
ton threshold for participation would focus on large industry, and would not directly impact the 
majority of small and medium-sized businesses. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the 
25,000 ton CO2e would include relatively few small entities. This is confirmed by the threshold 
analysis discussed [above], which found that small production facilities are largely exempt from 
the rule.

As shown in Table 5-27, the screening analysis suggested several sectors may have 1% to 
3% cost-to-receipt ratios for model establishments owned by businesses with less than 20 
employees. To assess the likelihood that these small businesses would be covered by the rule, we 
performed several case studies for manufacturing industries where the cost-to-receipt ratio 
exceeded 1% (see Table 5-27). For each industry, we used and applied emission data from a 
recent study examining emission thresholds (Nicholas Institute, 2008). This study provides 
industry-average CO2 emission rates (e.g., tons per employee) for the manufacturing industries 
that correspond to the industries listed in Table 5-22.

a In cases where an emission rate was reported (tons per employee), we multiplied this rate by 20 employees to
estimate annual emissions. In cases where the appropriate emissions rate was not available, we used the reported 
annual emissions for an establishment with 50 or fewer employees.  
As shown in Table 5-27, there are two industries (cement and lime manufacturing) where 
emission rates suggest small businesses with less than 20 employees could potentially be covered 
by the rule. As a result, EPA examined in more detail screening analysis using small business 
information compiled from the latest EPA analyses for these industries (EPA, 2003; RTI, 2008). 
In these analyses, the cement and lime plants’ corporate structures are carefully examined and 
their ultimate parent companies were identified using industry surveys and the latest private 
databases such as Dun & Bradstreet. For the Portland cement industry, four ultimate parent 
5-53 

  
 
companies are classified as small using the SBA firm size standards. The smallest company has 
one plant and reported revenues of approximately $26 million. Using the average entity cost of 
$65,000, the cost-sales ratio is less than 1%. For the lime manufacturing industry, 19 ultimate 
parent companies were classified as small using the SBA firm size standards. The smallest 
company has one plant and reported revenues of approximately $7 million. Using the average 
entity cost of $60,000, the cost-sales ratio is also less than 1%.  
Additional analysis for a model small government also showed that the annualized 
reporting program costs were less than 1% of revenue. These impacts are likely representative of
ratios in industries where data limitations do not allow EPA to compute sales tests (e.g., general 
stationary combustion and manure management).
Although this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities, the Agency nonetheless tried to reduce the impact of this rule on small entities, 
including seeking input from a wide range of private- and public-sector stakeholders. When 
developing the proposed rule, the Agency took special steps to ensure that the burdens imposed 
on small entities were minimal. The Agency conducted several meetings with industry trade 
associations to discuss regulatory options and the corresponding burden on industry, such as 
recordkeeping and reporting. The Agency investigated alternative thresholds and analyzed the 
marginal costs associated with requiring smaller entities with lower emissions to report. The 
Agency also recommended a hybrid method for reporting, which provides flexibility to entities 
and helps minimize reporting costs. A final summary of the emissions covered and the costs 
imposed by this rule is provided in Table 5-28. As this table indicates, the total national 
emissions covered under the proposed rule are 3.9 billion MtCO2e, total capital costs for the 
proposed rule are $87 million, and the national annualized cost for proposed rule in the first year 
is $160 million.

SECTION 6 

BENEFITS REVIEW 

6.1 Synopsis 
The proposed reporting rule will collect and verify emissions data from facilities and 
make the information publicly available. This section reviews the benefits of mandatory 
reporting programs based on previous experience with emissions inventory programs in the 
United States and abroad. 
Recent policy discussions have highlighted potential benefits to society of the mandatory 
GHG reporting program (Pew, 2008). Benefits to the public include building public confidence 
through clear and transparent emission measures and reports and the ability of the public to make 
facilities accountable for their emissions. A GHG reporting system will also have the benefit of 
providing policy makers and analysts with a data set that is comprehensive and reduces the 
potential for policy bias due to non-reporting by certain sectors.17 Benefits to industry include the 
identification of cost-effective GHG reduction opportunities and disclosure that provides firms 
with incentives to reduce emissions voluntarily, and provides emissions data to service 
industries, such as insurance and financial markets. Availability of emissions information to the 
public, consumers, investors, corporations and government regulators provides a sound basis for 
future policy analysis. This benefits society as a whole. Accurate and transparent information is 
necessary for the implementation of efficient approaches that meet environmental goals with the 
lowest cost to the economy. 
6.2 Background 
6.2.1 Background on Existing GHG Reporting Rules 
Currently, there are a variety of reporting programs in the United States. The U.S. Acid 
Rain Program requires electricity-generating units that are regulated for SO2 to also report CO2 
emissions. In addition, there are a variety of mandatory state-level programs in 12 states, such as 
Maine, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Oregon. A number of 
voluntary corporate-level systems exist as well, including Climate Leaders, the California 
Climate Action Registry, and 1605(b) program. These programs were designed for many 
different purposes and are not harmonized. These efforts also may not provide a sufficient basis 
for future GHG reduction policies, because their systems do not provide a comprehensive and 
coherent picture of all GHG emission sources at the facility level. The majority of emissions in 
17The rule has broad coverage of GHG emitting sectors, but does exclude sectors such as international bunker fuels, 
enteric fermentation, wastewater treatment, among other smaller sources and sinks.

the United States are not tracked under these systems. The proposed federal mandatory reporting 
system would build upon these efforts and provide policy makers with data to inform future 
national climate policies. 
6.2.2 Benefits Analysis Methodology 
This section describes the benefits of a mandatory reporting system. Because quantifying 
the benefits of a policy that monitors but does not reduce GHG emissions would be very 
difficult, the benefits laid out in this chapter are strictly qualitative. This qualitative review is 
based on a systematic literature review of previous mandatory reporting systems, voluntary 
reporting systems, and a sampling of emissions reduction policies with and without mandatory 
reporting. Ideally, empirical estimates of the accrued benefits from access to information based 
on pollution registries would be used to estimate the benefits of the greenhouse gas registry. 
While the academic literature provides robust estimates for the benefits of policies which reduce 
pollution directly, it provides little empirical data of the benefits of reporting emissions data. 
Benefit studies of environmental information disclosure focus primarily on the structure or 
rationale for examining the benefits of information disclosure (Beierle, 2003). Therefore, this 
study focuses on a qualitative review of the benefits of a greenhouse gas reporting policy. 
The purpose of this qualitative literature review is to relate the ongoing policy dialogue 
about reporting systems and past policies to the proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule. This 
literature reviews current air pollution and toxic emission reporting rules and their outcomes on 
stakeholders, while acknowledging that the differences between air pollution and toxics compare 
to greenhouse gases are significant.18 The following is a description of all benefits discussed in 
the academic literature of a pollution reporting rule. 
6.3 Discussion of Benefits 
6.3.1 Benefits of a Mandatory Program 
A mandatory GHG emissions reporting system would enable the creation of a 
comprehensive, accessible database. Such a database would yield benefits to society in myriad 
ways by lowering the information costs associated with emission reductions. Both the 
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) (2005) and the EPA (2003) 
have documented ways in which the public, industry, government, investment community and 
academic community have utilized pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) to 
accomplish tasks that would be costly or unattainable without such available information. Below, 
18See World Bank (2000) for a discussion of the main advantages and disadvantages of using information disclosure 
as a policy tool generally. 
6-2 

  
the benefits of uses relevant to a GHG emissions reporting system are explored qualitatively for 
the respective stakeholder groups. 
6.3.2 Benefits to the Public 
6.3.2.1 Policy Development 
The greatest benefit of mandatory reporting of industry GHG emissions to government 
would be realized in developing future GHG policies. For example, in the European Union’s 
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), a lack of accurate monitoring at the facility level before 
establishing CO2 allowance permits resulted in allocation of permits for emissions levels an 
average of 15% above actual levels in every country except the United Kingdom. Consequently, 
the allowance market experienced a price drop when the first year of emissions data were 
published (Bailey, 2007). The U.S. mandatory reporting rule would creates a foundation of 
reliable baseline emission estimates for the purpose of informing future policies and avoiding 
unexpected consequences of those policies. 
6.3.2.2 Builds Public Confidence and Trust 
A mandatory reporting system will increase transparency of facility emissions data. A 
qualitative study in the United Kingdom compared similar communities surrounding chemical 
complexes with and without right-to-know laws, and found that the community with the right-to­
know law and corresponding available data on toxic emissions experienced increased levels of 
trust towards government and industry to ensure the environmental protection and public health. 
(Gouldson, 2004). While greenhouse gases do not directly affect health, increased environmental 
stewardship is becoming a higher priority among Americans (PEW, 2007). Public confidence in 
the government and industries actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to increase 
with a transparent accounting of GHG emissions.  
6.3.2.3 Direct Actions 
Transparent, public data on emissions allows for accountability of polluters to the public 
stakeholders who bear the cost of the pollution. Citizens, community groups and labor unions 
have made use of data from PRTRs to negotiate directly with polluters to lower emissions, 
circumventing greater government regulation. There are several examples in the literature of 
environmental organizations and community groups negotiating with facilities directly based on 
their publicly available pollution data (EPA, 2003). While many of these groups were local, 
grassroots organizations, focused geographically on environmental health issues, it is likely that
environmental organizations focused on climate change will use the data in a similar manner. 
6-3 

  
                                                 
  
The Mandatory Reporting Rule for GHG emissions would allow groups interested in pressuring 
industry to reduce their emissions to negotiate with the top emitters.  
6.3.2.4 Voluntary Programs 
Voluntary agreements to promote energy efficiency in industry or promote specific types 
of technologies are used widely in the industrial sector. The U.S. government currently has 
several ongoing voluntary programs to help reduce GHGs including, the Voluntary Aluminum
Industrial Partnership to reduce perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions, and the Landfill Methane 
Outreach Program, the Coal Mine Methane Outreach Program, Natural GasStar and AgStar 
which promote the capture-and-use of methane in these sectors. In addition, some industries have 
voluntary plans or roadmaps to help the industry achieve an emissions reduction goal. The 
American Iron and Steel Institute introduced an energy efficiency goal and a research and 
development plan for the industry. 
While no study has been done on whether or not voluntary programs with mandatory 
reporting are more effective than those without, evaluations of several major voluntary programs 
have noted that need for a strong reporting mechanism is necessary (Worrell and Price, 2001). A 
transparent reporting system increases the credibility of the voluntary program and the reductions 
attributed to the program. A standardized reporting system also allows program mangers to 
readjust the programs strategy to meet the evolving needs of a program. In the case of the GHG 
reporting rule, the data collected would help evaluate the achievements of the current programs 
and provide verification of voluntary actions by industry, strengthening the effectiveness of the 
programs.  
6.3.2.5 Consumers of GHG-Intensive Goods and Labeling 
Publicly available emissions data would allow individuals to alter their consumption 
habits based on the GHG emissions of producers. Green labeling programs may use the verified 
GHG emissions data from this mandatory rule to provide comprehensive information to the 
public, particularly on durable goods such as appliances, electronics, etc. However, as with all 
eco-labeling projects, the process takes a committed effort to build recognition and market 
products as having a low carbon footprint.19 Uncertainty over the willingness to pay for low 
carbon products makes this benefit to consumers difficult to predict. 
19For a thorough review of evaluations conducted for eco-labeling programs, see Thogerson, 2002.

 6.3.3 Benefits to Industry and Investors 
6.3.3.1 Public Relations 
One benefit of GHG emissions monitoring for industry is the value of having 
independent, verifiable data to present to the public to demonstrate appropriate environmental 
stewardship. For example, General Motors issues its Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, which makes use of TRI data and the Canadian National Pollutant Release Inventory to 
support its environmental achievements. Such monitoring also allows for inclusion of 
standardized GHG data into environmental management systems (EMS), providing the necessary 
information to achieve and disseminate their environmental achievements. Using data from a 
verified, standard methodology as proposed under the GHG reporting rule gives the facilities 
credibility when claiming environmental improvements. Hamilton (1995) and Konar and Cohen 
(1997) are two examples of empirical studies that have investigated how the TRI has affected 
firm behavior and stock market valuation. Hamilton (1995) finds a stock price return of -0.03% 
due to TRI release. Firms that experienced the largest drop in their stock prices also reacted by 
reducing their reported emissions most in subsequent years. 
6.3.3.2 Standardization 
Once facilities invest in the institutional knowledge and systems to report emissions, the 
cost of monitoring should fall and the accuracy of the accounting should improve. A 
standardized reporting program will also allow for facilities to benchmark themselves against 
similar facilities to understand better their relative standing within their industry.  
6.3.3.3 Potential Cost Savings 
Mandatory reporting of GHG emissions could illuminate previously unmeasured wasteful 
processes, yielding cost-saving conservation measures that would offset some of the costs 
associated with the monitoring. Acushnet Rubber Company, Inc. saves approximately $100,000 
annually after eliminating use of the potential carcinogen trichloroethylene, identified using TRI, 
from its facility as part of its EMS (EPA, 2007). Under a mandatory reporting rule for GHG 
emissions, facilities may discover their facilities could feasibly install cost saving, emission 
reduction technologies such as energy efficiency improvements, co-generation opportunities, or 
methane capture-and-use technologies. 
6.3.3.4 Data Valuable to Service Industries 
In addition to the benefits for the facilities being monitored, the data can be valuable to 
companies doing business with GHG-emitting firms. Firms have sold pollution-prevention 
technologies to customers found using TRI data (Pew, 2008). In addition, insurance companies 
6-5 

  
 
may find these data valuable in assessing risk. In general, improved information lowers search 
and transaction costs for providers of mitigation products and services. 
6.3.4 Reducing Uncertainty: Benefits to all Stakeholders 
Reducing uncertainty in greenhouse gas emission estimates is an underlying benefit that 
increases benefits to all stakeholders. Policy development, direct action by the public and 
consumers, standardization, and reliable data for firms, shareholders and service industries to use 
in decision-making all require certainty in emission estimates in order to make environmentally 
sound and cost-effective decisions. Increased certainty in the emission estimates facilitates the 
comparison across reduction options, companies and sectors where different data or approaches 
have been used. Some emission sources covered under this rule are more uncertain than others 
because of the nature of the greenhouse gas generation (biological vs. chemical reaction) and the 
lack of basic data collection (i.e., the amount and content of waste being disposed at each 
landfill). Finalizing this rule will increase the certainty of these emissions due to increased 
information about each source and may spur additional research into sources that are not as well 
understood or documented. (IIASA, 2007) 
In addition, increased certainty in emission estimates increase the probability that 
commitments to reductions have been credibly met. This allows for a stable emissions trading 
market, whether voluntary or mandatory, and reinforces the credibility of an emissions credit. 
Without increased certainty within a sector, company or a specific project, the emission credit 
produced may be considered risky and not trade for full value. Increasing the certainty of each 
credit benefits the buyer, the seller, and the overall market place. (PWC, 2007)

SECTION 7 

STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE ORDER REVIEWS
 
This section describes EPA’s compliance with several applicable executive orders and 
statutes during the development of the proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule. 
7.1 Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review
Under Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this 
action is an “economically significant regulatory action” because it is likely to have an annual 
economic effect of $100 million or more. EPA’s cost analysis, presented in Section 4, estimates 
that under the proposed regulatory option, the total annualized cost of the proposed rule will be 
approximately $168 million during the first year of the program and $134 million in subsequent 
years (including $8 million of programmatic costs to the Agency). Accordingly, EPA submitted 
this action to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 
12866, and any changes made in response to OMB recommendations have been documented in 
the docket for this action. 
In addition, EPA prepared this RIA, an analysis of the potential costs and benefits 
associated with this action. In this report, EPA has identified the regulatory options considered, 
their costs, the emissions that would likely be reported under each option, and explained the 
selection of the option chosen for the proposed rule. The costs of the proposed rule are reported 
in Section 4. In addition, EPA has conducted a qualitative assessment of the benefits of the 
proposed rule, which are reported in Section 6. Overall, EPA has concluded that the costs of the 
proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule, while substantial, are outweighed by the potential 
benefits of more comprehensive information about GHG emissions. 
7.2 Paperwork Reduction Act 
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for 
approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The ICR 
document prepared by EPA has been assigned EPA ICR number 2300.01. 
EPA plans to collect complete and accurate economy-wide data on facility-level GHG 
emissions. Accurate and timely information on GHG emissions is essential for informing future 
climate change policy decisions. Through data collected under this rule, EPA will gain a better 
understanding of the relative emissions of specific industries, and the distribution of emissions 
from individual facilities within those industries. The facility-specific data will also improve our 
understanding of the factors that influence GHG emission rates and the actions that facilities are 
7-1 

  
 
 
 
 
already taking to reduce emissions. Additionally, EPA will be able to track the trend of
emissions from industries and facilities within industries over time, particularly in response to 
policies and potential regulations. The data collected by this rule will improve EPA’s ability to 
formulate climate change policy options and to assess which industries would be affected, and 
how these industries would be affected by the options. 
This information collection is mandatory and will be carried out under CAA Sections 114 
and 208. Information identified and marked as Confidential Business Information (CBI) will not 
be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 2. However, 
emissions information collected under CAA Sections 114 and 208 cannot be claimed as CBI and 
will be made public. 
The projected cost and hour burden is $143 million and 1.63 million hours per year. The 
estimated average burden per response is 2 hours; the proposed frequency of response is annual 
for all respondents that must comply with the proposed rule’s reporting requirements, except for 
electricity-generating units that are already required to report quarterly under 40 CFR Part 75 
(ARP); and the estimated average number of likely respondents per year, excluding 43 federal 
facilities, is 18,775. The cost burden to respondents resulting from the collection of information 
includes the total capital and start-up cost annualized over the equipment’s expected useful life 
(averaging $20.7 million per year) a total operation and maintenance component (averaging 
$22.4 million per year), and a labor cost component (averaging $100.0 million per year). Burden 
is defined at 5 CFR Part 1320.3(b). These cost numbers differ from those shown elsewhere in the 
RIA for several reasons: 
 ICR costs represent the average cost over the first three years of the rule, but costs are 
reported elsewhere in the RIA for the first year of the rule and for subsequent years of 
the rule.; 
 The costs of reporting electricity purchases have been excluded from the ICR, but are 
still reported in the RIA, although electricity use reporting has been removed from the 
proposed rule and EPA is soliciting comment on it (see Section 4.2.2, pg 4-18); and 
 The first-year costs of coverage determination, estimated to be $867.60 per facility 
for approximately 16,800 facilities that ultimately determine they do not have to 
report, are included in the ICR but not in the RIA (see Section 4.2.2, pg 4-18). These 
costs, averaged over 3 years, are $4.87 million incurred by an average of 5,613 
respondents per year. 
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB 
control numbers for EPA’s regulations in 40 CFR are listed in 40 CFR Part 9. To comment on 
7-2 

  
                                                 
 
the Agency’s need for this information, the accuracy of the provided burden estimates, and any 
suggested methods for minimizing respondent burden, EPA has established a public docket for 
this rule.  
7.3 Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit enterprises. 
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we 
defined a small entity as (1) a small business, as defined by SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR Part 
121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, 
school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; or (3) a small 
organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and operated and is 
not dominant in its field. 
For affected small entities, EPA conducted a screening assessment comparing 
compliance costs for affected industry sectors to industry-specific receipts data for 
establishments owned by small businesses. This ratio constitutes a “sales” test that computes the 
per-entity annualized compliance costs of this proposed rule as a percentage of sales and 
determines whether the ratio exceeds some level (e.g., 1% or 3%).20 The cost-to-sales ratios were 
constructed at the establishment level (average reporting program costs per 
establishment/average establishment receipts) for several business size ranges. This allowed EPA 
to account for receipt differences between establishments owned by large and small businesses 
and differences in small business definitions across affected industries. EPA used average per-
entity annualized costs for each industry sector, which tends to overstate costs incurred by the 
smallest entities. The results of the screening assessment are reported in Section 5 (Tables 5-26 
and 5-27). The cost-to-sales ratios are less than 1% for establishments owned by small 
businesses that EPA considers most likely to be covered by the reporting program (e.g., 
establishments owned by businesses with 20 or more employees). The screening analysis thus 
indicates that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The screening assessment for small governments compared the sum of 
20EPA’s Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) guidance for rule writers suggests the “sales” test continues to be the 
preferred quantitative metric for economic impact screening analysis. 
7-3 

 average costs of compliance for combustion, local distribution companies, and landfills to 
average revenues for small governments. Even for a small government owning all three source 
types, the costs constitute less than 1 percent of average revenues for the smallest category of 
governments (those with fewer than 10,000 people). 
For several source categories, enterprises with fewer than 20 employees have cost-to­
sales ratios between 1% and 3%. EPA examined these in greater detail, and concluded that very 
few firms with fewer than 20 employees would be subject to the rule. Although this proposed 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, EPA 
nonetheless took several steps to reduce the impact of this rule on small entities. For example, 
EPA determined appropriate thresholds that reduce the number of small businesses reporting. In 
addition, EPA is not requiring facilities to install CEMS if they do not already have them. 
Facilities without CEMS can calculate emissions using readily available data or data that is less 
expensive to collect, such as process data or material consumption data. For some source 
categories, EPA developed tiered methods that are simpler and less burdensome. Also, EPA is 
requiring annual reporting instead of more frequent reporting. 
Through comprehensive outreach activities, EPA held approximately 100 meetings 
and/or conference calls with representatives of the primary audience groups, including numerous 
trade associations and industries that include small business members. EPA’s outreach activities 
are documented in the memorandum, “Summary of EPA Outreach Activities for Developing the 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule,” located in Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-055. 
7.4 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), P.L. 104-4, establishes 
requirements for federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on state, local, 
and tribal governments and the private sector. Under Section 202 of the UMRA, EPA generally 
must prepare a written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for proposed and final rules 
with “federal mandates” that may result in expenditures to state, local, and tribal governments, in 
the aggregate, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. Before 
promulgating an EPA rule for which a written statement is needed, Section 205 of the UMRA 
generally requires EPA to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives 
and adopt the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the 
objectives of the rule. The provisions of Section 205 do not apply when they are inconsistent 
with applicable law. Moreover, Section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the 
least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes, 
7-4 

  
with the final rule, an explanation of why that alternative is not being adopted. Before EPA 
establishes any regulatory requirements that may significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments, including tribal governments, it must develop a small government agency plan 
under Section 203 of the UMRA. The plan must provide for notifying potentially affected small 
governments; enabling officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely 
input in developing EPA regulatory proposals with significant federal intergovernmental 
mandates; and informing, educating, and advising small governments on compliance with the 
regulatory requirements. 
EPA has determined that this rule contains a federal mandate that may result in 
expenditures of $100 million or more for state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or 
the private sector in any one year. Accordingly, EPA has prepared, under Section 202 of the 
UMRA, a written statement that is presented below. The statement addresses the following 
items: 
1. 	 The authorizing legislation (7.4.1). 
2. 	 Benefit-cost analysis, including an analysis of the distribution of costs among 
ownership types, sectors of the economy, and regions of the country; and an 
assessment of the extent to which the costs of state, local, and tribal governments 
could be paid for by the federal government (Section 4.1, Section 5, and Section 
7.4.2). 
3. 	 Estimates of future compliance costs and disproportionate budgetary effects (Section 
4.1, 7.4.3). 
4. 	 Macroeconomic impacts (Section 7.4.4). 
5. 	 A summary of EPA’s consultation with state, local, and tribal governments and their 
concerns, including a summary of the Agency’s evaluation of those comments and 
concerns (Section 2.3.4, Section 7.4.5). 
6. 	 Identification and consideration of regulatory alternatives and the selection of the 
least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the 
objectives of the rule (Section 4.4, Section 7.4.6). 
7.4.1 Authorizing Legislation
On December 26, 2007, President Bush signed the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations 
Amendment, which authorized funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to 
develop and publish a draft rule on an accelerated schedule:  
[N]ot less than $3,500,000 shall be provided for activities to develop and publish 
a draft rule not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and a 
final rule not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to 
7-5 

  
require mandatory reporting of GHG emissions above appropriate threshold in all 
sectors of the economy. 
The accompanying explanatory statement stated that EPA shall “use its existing authority 
under the Clean Air Act” to develop a mandatory GHG reporting rule.  
The agency is further directed to include in its rule reporting of emission resulting 
from upstream production and downstream sources, to the extent that the 
Administrator deems it appropriate. The Administrator shall determine 
appropriate thresholds of emissions above which reporting is required, and how 
frequently reports shall be submitted to EPA. The Administrator shall have 
discretion to use existing reporting requirements for electric generating units 
under Section 821 of the Clean Air Act. 
EPA has developed this regulation under authority of Sections 114 and 208 of the Clean 
Air Act. The required activities under this federal mandate include monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting of GHGs. 
7.4.2 Benefit-Cost Analysis 
EPA has considered the costs and benefits of the proposed GHG reporting rule. The 
engineering costs of the rule for both stationary sources and mobile sources are described in 
Section 4. Costs for stationary sources are estimated to be approximately $153 million in the first 
year; for subsequent years, costs for stationary sources are estimated to be approximately $120 
million. For mobile sources, the costs are estimated to be approximately $7 million for the first 
year and for subsequent years. 
7.4.2.1 Distribution of Costs 
Costs were estimated for each of the subparts of the rule, which include stationary 
combustion, electricity generation, various industrial processes and biological processes, as well 
as mobile sources. Among the various subparts of the rule, most affect only privately owned 
sources. The exceptions are stationary combustion, landfills, electricity generators, and natural 
gas suppliers, or local distribution companies (LDCs).  
Table 7-1 presents the distribution of ownership (private owners and state, local, and 
tribal government owners) for the sectors that include both privately owned and publicly owned 
facilities.

Costs of federal respondents (fed $127 $0 $53 $0 
owned/operated) 
Total costs by sector $11,990 $26,344 $3,264 $1,050
Note: Columns may not sum to totals due to rounding. 
This regulation applies directly to both public- and private-sector facilities that directly 
emit GHGs and to those that supply fuel or chemicals that emit GHGs when used. However, this 
rule does not impose any implementation responsibilities on state, local, or tribal governments, 
and it is not expected to increase the cost of existing regulatory programs managed by those 
governments. The proposed rule imposes burdens on state, local, or tribal governments only 
when they own affected facilities that must comply with the proposed rule. Overall, EPA 
estimates that approximately 2,600 facilities owned by state, local, or tribal governments will be
required to report their greenhouse gas emissions by the proposed rule. EPA estimates that an 
additional 1,979 facilities owned by state, local, or tribal governments will incur some costs 
during the first year of the rule to make a reporting determination and subsequently determine 
that their emissions are below the threshold and thus, they are not required to report their 
emissions. EPA does not anticipate that substantial numbers of either public- or private-sector 
entities will incur significant economic impacts as a result of this proposed rule making. Overall, 
EPA estimates that for most sectors, the costs represent at most 0.1% of sales or receipts. Even 
for small entities, EPA estimates that the costs are on average less than 0.5% of sales or receipts. 
The impacts associated with such costs are not generally considered significant. UMRA requires 
an analysis of possible federal assistance to state, local, or tribal governments affected by the 
proposed rule. Because the rule imposes no implementation or regulatory responsibilities and 
only imposes compliance costs on government-owned GHG emitting facilities, EPA is unaware 
of any federal assistance available to these governments to subsidize their compliance costs. 
In addition to examining the distribution of ownership between private entities and 
governments for these sectors, EPA also examined the distribution of respondents and costs 
across industry sectors. Table 7-2 shows the distribution of costs for the first year after 
promulgation and for subsequent years for subparts with the highest costs for the 25,000 MT

threshold. Of the $168 million in costs estimated for the first year of the regulation, oil and 
natural gas transportation account for nearly 20% of national costs. Iron and steel production and 
general stationary combustion are each between 10% and 20% of national first-year costs.

Total $168.4 100% $134.0 100% 
Note: An additional $3.5 million is incurred annually by the public sector during the rulemaking process, which will 
last between 1 and 2 years. 
Landfills, pulp and paper manufacturing, and suppliers of coal-based products each represent 
between 5% and 10% of national costs. All other sectors account for less than 5% of national 
costs. In subsequent years, the overall distribution is similar, although the costs and shares of 
7-8 

 general stationary combustion and oil and natural gas systems’ shares increase slightly, while 
other subparts’ shares fall somewhat.  
EPA does not have sufficient information to characterize the regional distribution of 
affected sources. 
7.4.2.2 Characterization of Benefits of Mandatory Reporting Programs 
EPA also examined the benefits of the proposed rule through a qualitative benefits 
assessment. EPA conducted a literature review to identify and characterize the benefits of 
programs that require mandatory reporting of environmental information. These programs 
convey benefits to the public, to investors, to industry, and to government. The benefits, 
described in Section 6 of this document, include improved information about GHG emissions 
that would enhance America’s ability to develop sound future climate policies and that may 
encourage GHG emitters to develop voluntary plans to reduce their emissions. Although EPA 
was unable to quantify or value these benefits, they may be substantial.  
7.4.3 Future Costs and Disproportionate Budget Effects 
Although EPA acknowledges that, over time, changes in the patterns of economic activity 
may mean that GHG generation, and thus reporting costs, will change, data are inadequate for 
projecting these changes. Thus, EPA assumes that costs averaged over the first three years are 
typical of ongoing costs of compliance. EPA estimates that future compliance costs, including 
approximately $8.0 million in federal programmatic costs, will total approximately $145 million 
per year. These costs are broadly distributed to a variety of economic sectors and represent less 
than 0.1% of revenues for most affected sectors. Thus, EPA does not believe that the costs are 
large enough, in general, to impose disproportionate budgetary effects. 
7.4.4 Impacts on the National Economy 
EPA estimates that future compliance costs (based on average costs over the first 3 years) 
will total approximately $145 million per year. These costs are broadly distributed to a variety of 
economic sectors and represent approximately 0.001% of 2007 gross domestic product; overall, 
EPA does not believe the proposed rule will have a significant macroeconomic impact on the 
national economy.  
7.4.5 Consultation with State, Local, and Tribal Governments 
Consistent with the intergovernmental consultation provisions of Section 204 of the 
UMRA and Executive Order 12875, “Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership,” EPA 
initiated an outreach effort with the governmental entities affected by this rule, including state, 
7-9 

  
 
 
 
 
local, and tribal officials. The outreach audience included state environmental protection 
agencies, regional and tribal air pollution control agencies, and other state and local government 
organizations. EPA contacted several states and state and regional organizations already involved 
in GHG emissions reporting. EPA also conducted several conference calls with tribal 
organizations. For example, EPA staff solicited input and maintained an open door policy for 
those interested in discussing the rulemaking. Since January 2008, EPA staff have held more 
than 100 meetings with stakeholders, including the following: 
 trade associations and firms in potentially affected industries/sectors; 
 state, local, and tribal environmental control agencies and regional air quality 
planning organizations; 
 state and regional organizations already involved in GHG emissions reporting, such 
as TCR, CARB, and WCI; 
 other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, which operate reporting systems relevant to GHG emissions; and 
 environmental groups and other nongovernmental organizations. 
During the meetings, we shared information about the statutory requirements and 
timetable for developing a rule. Stakeholders were encouraged to provide input on key issues. 
Examples of topics discussed included existing GHG monitoring and reporting programs and 
lessons learned, thresholds and schedules for reporting, scope of reporting, handling of 
confidential data, data verification, and the role of states in administering the program. As 
needed, the EPA technical workgroups followed up with these stakeholder groups on a variety of 
methodological, technical, and policy issues. EPA staff also provided information to tribes 
through conference calls with different Indian tribal working groups and organizations at EPA 
and through individual calls with tribal board members of TCR.  
A full list of organizations EPA met with when developing this proposal has been placed 
in the docket for this rulemaking (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-055). 
7.4.6 Consideration of Regulatory Alternatives 
EPA carefully examined regulatory alternatives and selected the lowest cost/least 
burdensome alternative deemed by EPA to be adequate to address congressional concerns and to 
provide a comprehensive source of information about emissions of GHGs. Section 3 discusses 
the recommended option. The evaluation of the proposed alternative and the other alternatives 
considered is described in Section 4. 
7-10 

  
 
 
 
As described above, EPA evaluated a variety of options for each dimension of the 
proposed GHG reporting program, and selected a preferred or recommended option for each 
dimension.  
7.4.6.1 Recommended Options 
We summarize the recommended option for each dimension below. 
 Threshold: Hybrid approach 
– 	 A facility that emits 25,000 tons CO2e/year or more reports all sources for which 
there are methods.  
– 	 The thresholds fall generally into three groups: capacity, emissions, or entire 
source category (“All in”).  
– 	 EPA may allow a facility to use a capacity threshold when already reporting (e.g., 
ARP) or where an emissions-based threshold is not practical (e.g., landfills). 
 Measurement Methodology: Hybrid approach, with source-specific methodologies 
– 	 A facility must use direct measurement of stationary combustion sources where 
CEMS are currently installed (with some exceptions), including for other 
regulatory programs (e.g., CO2 emissions from EGUs in ARP). 
– 	 A facility must use source-specific calculation methods for other sources at the 
facility. 
 Reporting Frequency: Annual 
– 	 All reporters should report their emissions annually. 
– 	 An exception exists for those already reporting quarterly for existing mandatory 
programs (e.g., ARP, MSHA, EIA). 
 Verification: EPA as the verifier 
– 	 A facility should report emissions data and supporting information directly to 
EPA; EPA will use the information to verify the data. 
7.4.6.2 Scenarios Evaluated 
EPA developed alternative reporting scenarios and assessed the costs and emissions 
associated with each. Alternative scenarios were developed by creating the recommended 
scenario (the recommended option for each dimension, as shown in Table 3-1), then varying the 
levels in one dimension while keeping the other three dimensions at the recommended options. 
The alternative reporting scenarios evaluated are listed below: 
1. 	 A 1,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
7-11 

 2. 	 A 10,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
3. 	 A 100,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
4. 	 The measurement variable is changed to direct measurement; recommended option 
for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
5. 	 The measurement variable is changed to default emissions factors; recommended 
option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
6. 	 Existing federal data used for measurement of fuel suppliers; recommended option 
for threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources.  
7. 	 EPA uses default carbon content for fuel suppliers; recommended option for 
threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources. 
8. 	 Reporting is quarterly; recommended option for threshold, methodology, and verifier. 
9. 	 Verification is done by a third party; recommended option for threshold, 
methodology, and frequency. 
10. Reporting from upstream sources only; recommended option for methodology, 
frequency, and verifier. 
Although some of the alternatives considered may result in lower costs, EPA believes that the 
recommended option is the lowest-cost option available that would provide adequate information 
on GHG emissions to inform future policy making. 
7.5 Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires 
EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by state and local 
officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.” “Policies 
that have federalism implications” is defined in the executive order to include regulations that 
have “substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government 
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government.” 
This proposed rule does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial 
direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as 
specified in Executive Order 13132.  
This regulation applies to public- or private-sector facilities that directly emit GHGs and 
to those that supply fuel or chemicals that emit GHGs when used. Relatively few government 
7-12 

   
facilities would be affected. This regulation also does not limit the power of states or localities to 
collect GHG data and/or regulate GHG emissions. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply 
to this rule. 
7.6 	 Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments 
Executive Order 13175, entitled “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments” (59 FR 22951, November 6, 2000), requires EPA to develop an accountable 
process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of 
regulatory policies that have tribal implications.”
This proposed rule is not expected to have tribal implications, as specified in Executive 
Order 13175. This regulation applies to facilities that directly emit GHGs and to those that 
supply fuel or chemicals that emit GHG when used. Few facilities expected to be affected by the 
proposed rule are likely to be owned by tribal governments. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does 
not apply to this proposed rule. 
Although Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this proposed rule, EPA sought 
opportunities to provide information to tribal governments and representatives during 
development of the rule. In consultation with EPA’s American Indian Environment Office, 
EPA’s outreach plan included tribes. EPA staff provided information to tribes through 
conference calls with multiple Indian working groups and organizations at EPA that interact with 
tribes and through individual calls with two tribal board members of TCR. In addition, EPA 
prepared a short article on the GHG reporting rule that appeared on the front page of a tribal 
newsletter—Tribal Air News—that was distributed to EPA/OAQPS’s network of tribal 
organizations. EPA gave a presentation on various climate efforts, including the mandatory 
reporting rule, at the National Tribal Conference on Environmental Management in June, 2008. 
In addition, EPA had copies of a short information sheet distributed at a meeting of the National 
Tribal Caucus. For a complete list of tribal contacts, see the “Summary of EPA Outreach 
Activities for Developing the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule,” in the Docket for this 
rulemaking (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-055).  
7.7 	 Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children from Environmental Health and 
Safety Risks 
EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 (62 F.R. 19885, April 23, 1997) as applying only 
to those regulatory actions that concern health or safety risks, such that the analysis required 
under Section 5-501 of the executive order has the potential to influence the regulation. This 
7-13 

  
action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it does not establish an environmental 
standard intended to mitigate health or safety risks. 
7.8 	 Executive Order 13211: Actions that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use 
This proposed rule is not a “significant energy action” as defined in Executive Order 
13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect 
on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. Further, we have concluded that this rule is not 
likely to have any adverse energy effects. 
This proposal relates to monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping at facilities that directly 
emit GHGs and to those that supply fuel or chemicals that emit GHGs when used; it does not 
impact energy supply, distribution or use. Therefore, we conclude that this rule is not likely to 
have any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use. 
7.9 	 National Technology Transfer Advancement Act 
Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 
(NTTAA), Public Law No. 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary 
consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with 
applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards 
(e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are 
developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide 
Congress, through OMB, with explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and 
applicable voluntary consensus standards. 
This proposed rulemaking involves technical standards. EPA proposes to use more than 
40 voluntary consensus standards from six different voluntary consensus standards bodies: 
American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM), American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
(ASME), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Gas Processors Association 
(GPA), American Gas Association (AGA), and American Petroleum Institute (API). These 
voluntary consensus standards will help facilities monitor, report, and keep records of GHG 
emissions. No new test methods were developed for this proposed rule. Instead, from existing 
rules for source categories and voluntary GHG programs, EPA identified existing means of 
monitoring, reporting, and keeping records of GHG emissions The existing methods (voluntary 
consensus standards) include a broad range of measurement techniques, including many for 
combustion sources, such as methods to analyze fuel and measure its heating value, methods to 
measure gas or liquid flow, and methods to gauge and measure petroleum and petroleum 
7-14 

  
 
 
products. The test methods are incorporated by reference into the proposed rule and are available 
as specified in Section 98.6 of subpart A. 
By incorporating voluntary consensus standards into this proposed rule, EPA is both 
meeting the requirements of the NTTAA and presenting multiple options and flexibility for 
measuring GHGs. 
7.10 	 Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in 
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations 
Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes federal executive 
policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent
practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by 
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-
income populations in the United States.  
EPA has determined that this proposed rule will not have disproportionately high and 
adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it 
does not affect the level of protection provided to human health or the environment; it is a rule 
addressing information collection and reporting procedures.

SECTION 8 

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  

In this RIA, EPA has examined the regulatory background, the development of the 
proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule, and estimated its costs and benefits. This section 
presents our overall conclusions. 
8.1 Discussion of Results 
EPA has developed this proposed rule in response to language contained in the FY 2008 
Consolidated Appropriations amendment (December 26, 2007), which authorized funding for 
EPA to publish the rule on an accelerated schedule. The major market failure that the proposed 
rule is designed to address is one of inadequate or asymmetric information: while existing state 
and federal programs collect similar data, the resulting data are neither comprehensive nor 
consistent. As such, they are an inadequate basis for the formation or evaluation of future climate 
policy. 
8.1.1 Development of the Proposed Rule 
EPA examined several regulatory alternative scenarios that were developed by varying 
options across several program dimensions, including Threshold, Methodology, Frequency, and 
Verification. The proposed regulatory alternative calls for:  
 a hybrid threshold, including a 25,000 tCO2e threshold for all facilities except certain 
sectors where a capacity-based threshold is appropriate;  
 a hybrid methodology, including facility-specific calculations for all facilities except 
those with CEMS monitoring in place under other programs; 
 annual frequency except for those sources already reporting quarterly; and 
 EPA as the verifier. 
Other scenarios evaluated included the following: 
1. 	 A 1,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
2. 	 A 10,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
3. 	 A 100,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and 
verifier. 
4. 	 The measurement variable is changed to direct measurement; recommended option 
for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
8-1 

  
 
5. 	 The measurement variable is changed to default emissions factors; recommended 
option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 
6. 	 Existing federal data used for measurement of fuel suppliers; recommended option 
for threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources.  
7. 	 EPA uses default carbon content for fuel suppliers; recommended option for 
threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources. 
8. 	 Reporting is quarterly; recommended option for threshold, methodology, and verifier. 
9. 	 Verification is done by a third party; recommended option for threshold, 
methodology, and frequency. 
10. Reporting from upstream sources only; recommended option for methodology, 
frequency, and verifier. 
8.1.2 Affected Source Categories 
EPA considered both direct emitters of GHGs (stationary combustion sources, industrial
processes, fugitive emissions, and biological processes); upstream emitters (fuel suppliers and 
industrial gas suppliers); and mobile sources. From these sources, EPA identified 18 source 
categories for which costs and impacts were examined. 
8.2 Assessment of Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule 
8.2.1 Estimated Costs and Impacts of the Mandatory GHG Reporting Program
Under the proposed rule, EPA estimates that 13,205 entities would be covered by the 
rule, emitting 3,870 MtCO2e per year. The total annualized costs incurred under the proposed 
rule by these entities would be $160 million for the first year and $127 million for subsequent 
years. Costs for general stationary combustion sources would be approximately $29 million in 
the first year and $24 million in subsequent years. Oil and natural gas systems would incur 
sector-wide costs of $33 million in the first year and $28 million per year in subsequent years. 
The Iron and Steel Production sector would incur $18 million in the first year and $14 million in 
subsequent years. The Landfills sector would incur $15 million in the first year and $10 million 
in subsequent years. The suppliers of coal and coal-based products sector would incur $11 
million in the first year and $5 million in subsequent years. Pulp and Paper Manufacturing would 
incur sector-wide costs of approximately $9 million per year for both the first and subsequent 
years. Other sectors are all estimated to incur costs less than $9 million per year.  
Overall, economic impacts on industry sectors are measured by comparing per-entity 
costs with average per entity receipts. These cost-to-sales ratios are less than 1% for 
establishments owned by small businesses that EPA considers most likely to be covered by the 
reporting program (e.g., establishments owned by a businesses with 20 or more employees) and 
8-2 

  
small government entities. This analysis enables EPA to determine that the proposed rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Overall, the 
proposed rule will impose national costs exceeding $100 million per year; the costs will be 
widely dispersed throughout the economy and relatively low on a per-entity basis. The estimated 
national costs represent approximately 0.001% of 2007 Gross Domestic Product. Thus, EPA 
does not estimate that there will be significant impacts on the economy in general or on 
individual sectors or small entities within those sectors. 
8.2.2 Summary of Qualitative Benefits Assessment 
EPA was unable to quantify the estimated benefits of the proposed rule. Instead, a 
qualitative assessment was performed, based on information from the literature and previous 
benefits assessments of existing emissions inventory programs.  
Recent policy discussions have highlighted potential benefits to society of the GHG 
reporting program (Pew, 2008). Benefits to the public include building public confidence 
through clear and transparent emission measures and reports and the ability of the public to make 
facilities accountable for their emissions. Benefits to industry include the identification of GHG 
reduction opportunities and disclosure, which provides firms with incentives to reduce emissions 
voluntarily, and provides emissions data to service industries, such as insurance and financial 
markets. A GHG reporting system will also have the benefit of providing policy makers and 
analysts with a comparable data set that is comprehensive and reduces the potential for policy 
bias due to non-reporting by certain sectors. In addition, a mandatory reporting system is a key 
element to an overall GHG policy; no effort can succeed without it.  
Studies published by OECD (2005) and EPA (2003) have documented benefits to various 
stakeholders, including the public, industry, investors, and government, of existing PRTRs. 
These benefits are likely similar to the benefits that would be experienced as a result of the 
proposed mandatory GHG reporting rule, and thus they provide a basis for a qualitative 
characterization of those benefits. The studies examined in Section 5 of this RIA describe the 
following types of benefits: 
 Public 
– 	 increased levels of trust towards government and industry where there are right-
to-know laws concerning emissions; 
– 	 information to enable citizens to negotiate directly with polluters; and 
– 	 information to enable environmentally aware consumers to alter their 
consumption habits based on GHG emissions of producers. 
8-3 

  
 
 
  
 Industry 
– 	 Public relations: having independent, verifiable data to present to the public 
would demonstrate appropriate environmental stewardship. 
– 	 Standardization: uniform industry standards would reduce the cost of reporting 
relative to non-uniform, jurisdiction-specific, and allow facilities to benchmark 
their performance against other similar facilities.
– 	 Potential cost savings: mandatory monitoring may uncover previously 
unmeasured wasteful processes, yielding cost-saving conservation opportunities 
that would offset some of the costs of monitoring. 
– 	 Potential customer data for service industries: information about GHG-emitting 
firms will be useful for firms that market emissions-reduction technologies, and to 
insurance companies for assessing risk. 
 Investors 
– 	 Information about emissions will enable investors to implement socially 
responsible investing using GHG emission information if they so choose. 
 Government
– 	 Policy development: The greatest benefit to government of mandatory GHG 
reporting is the comprehensive, consistent data it would provide, enabling 
government to develop accurate, informed future GHG policy.  
– 	 Comparability: A mandatory system would reduce the difficulties associated with 
comparing across different reporting standards across states or programs.  
– 	 Compliance and policy evaluation: Publicly available nationwide data on GHG 
emissions will enable government to develop and robustly evaluate environmental 
policies, and to ensure compliance with the policies once implemented. 
8.3 What Did We Learn through this Analysis? 
EPA’s examination of the costs and benefits of the proposed mandatory GHG reporting 
rule revealed that the proposed rule will impose an estimated $138 million (based on average 
costs over the first three years) in monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting costs on generators 
of GHGs that are widely distributed throughout the U.S. economy. Impacts of the costs on 
individual sectors and entities are expected to be generally small, comprising less than 1% of 
entity receipts and approximately 0.001% of 2007 GDP. Thus, in spite of the overall national 
costs, macroeconomic impacts are not anticipated, and EPA does not believe that the proposed 
rule will impose significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities. 
A review of the literature enabled us to characterize the expected types of benefits, which 
will be experienced by stakeholders, including the public, industry, investors, and government. 
8-4 

 Based on this qualitative assessment and evidence from other existing programs, EPA expects 
the benefits of the proposed rule to be substantial.
