National Organic Program (NOP); 
Sunset Review (2012) for Nutrient 
Vitamins and Minerals 
AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, 
USDA. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would 
address a recommendation submitted to 
the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) 
by the National Organic Standards 
Board (NOSB) on April 29, 2011. The 
recommendation pertains to the 2012 
Sunset Review of the listing for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals on the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) 
National List of Allowed and Prohibited 
Substances (National List). As 
recommended by the NOSB, the 
proposed rule would continue the 
exemption (use) for nutrient vitamins 
and minerals for 5 years after the 
October 21, 2012 sunset date. In 
addition, the proposed rule would 
amend the annotation to correct an 
inaccurate cross reference to U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration regulations 
(FDA). The proposed amendment to the 
annotation would clarify what synthetic 
substances are allowed as nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in organic 
products labeled as ‘‘organic’’ or ‘‘made 
with organic (specified ingredients or 
food group(s)).’’ 
DATES: Comments must be received by 
March 12, 2012.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Organic Foods Production Act of 
1990 (OFPA), (7 U.S.C. 6501–6522), 
authorizes the establishment of the 
National List. The National List 
identifies synthetic substances that are 
exempted (allowed) in organic 
production and nonsynthetic substances 
that are prohibited in organic crop and 
livestock production. The National List 
also identifies nonagricultural 
nonsynthetic, nonagricultural synthetic 
and nonorganic agricultural substances 
that may be used in organic handling. 
The exemptions and prohibitions 
granted under the OFPA are required to 
be reviewed every 5 years by the 
National Organic Standards Board 
(NOSB). The Secretary has authority 
under the OFPA to renew such 
exemptions and prohibitions. If the 
substances are not reviewed by the 
NOSB within 5 years of their inclusion 
on the National List and addressed by 
the Secretary, then their authorized use 
or prohibition expires under OFPA’s 
sunset provision. 
The exemption for the use of nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in ‘‘organic’’ and 
‘‘made with organic (specified 
ingredients or food group(s))’’ processed 
products is scheduled to expire on 
October 21, 2012. The NOP is taking 
this action to implement the NOSB 
recommendation to renew the 
allowance for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals through October 21, 2017. The 
NOP has also determined that, within 
the current listing for nutrient vitamins 
and minerals, the cross reference to the 
FDA’s fortification policy for food at 21 
CFR 104.20 was not accurate and that a 
correction to the current listing is 
necessary. This action would clarify 
what substances are covered under this 
exemption, consistent with the intent of 
the current listing as codified by the 
NOP final rule (65 FR 80548). This 
correction would facilitate compliance 
for organic operations, provide 
certifying agents greater certainty in 
assessing compliance and enable 
consumers to discern what substances 
may be used in organic foods. 
The potential impact of this action, 
including potential costs that could be 
incurred, and the alternatives 
considered are presented as part of the 
Executive Order 12866 section of this 
proposed rule. Upon issuance of a final 
rule on this action, the NOP intends to 
provide a compliance date of two years 
from the effective date of the amended 
listing. Prohibitions on the use of 
ingredients affected by this action 
would not be enforced until the 
compliance date. This timeline is 
intended to allow time for the NOSB’s 
review of petitions for substances not 
within the scope of the current listing or 
amended listing and provides the NOP 
with an opportunity to initiate 
rulemaking if the Board recommends 
that such substances be added to the

4 The proposed rule published in March 2000, 
was the second proposed rule for the National 
Organic Program. The first proposed rule was 
published on December 16, 1997 (62 FR 65850). 
The National List section in the 1997 proposed rule 
contained an exemption for ‘‘Nutrient 
supplements.’’

6 DHA and ARA are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty 
acids, respectively, which are naturally present in 
certain foods. Dietary sources of DHA include: cold 
water fatty fish, meats, and eggs. Dietary sources of 
ARA include: meat, poultry and eggs. Humans can 
convert the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid 
(ALA) to DHA and the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic 
acid (LA) to ARA. Natural sources of LA and ALA 
include: vegetable oils, nuts, seeds and some 
vegetables. Reference: University of Maryland

National List. In addition, the NOP 
believes this timeline would provide 
sufficient time for the organic trade to 
adjust product formulations based on 
the Board recommendations and 
rulemaking or to consider relabeling 
products. 
The Secretary appointed members to 
the NOSB for the first time in January 
1992. The NOSB began holding formal 
committee meetings in May 1992 and its 
first full Board meeting in September 
1992. The NOSB’s initial 
recommendations were presented to the 
Secretary on August 1, 1994. 
In advance of the Board’s November 
1995 meeting, two technical advisory 
panel (TAP) reports, one for ‘‘Nutrient 
Vitamins’’ and one for ‘‘Nutrient 
Minerals’’, were prepared. These reports 
were developed to inform the Board’s 
assessment of nutrient vitamins and 
minerals in consideration of the 
evaluation criteria for substances 
considered for inclusion on the National 
List as established in section 2119(m) of 
OFPA. The vitamins identified in the 
TAP review included: vitamins A, D, E, 
K, C, B6, B12; folic acid; thiamin (B1); 
riboflavin (B2); and biotin. The minerals 
identified in the TAP report for nutrient 
minerals included: Calcium; 
phosphorus; magnesium; sulfur; copper; 
iodine; iron; manganese; and zinc.1 
During the NOSB’s November 1995 
meeting, the NOSB finalized two 
recommendations regarding the 
addition of nutrient substances to 
organic food. These recommendations 
were developed to inform the 
establishment of the National Organic 
Program (NOP) regulations, including 
the National List. The first 
recommendation supported the addition 
of nutrient vitamins and minerals to the 
National List with the following 
annotation, ‘‘Accepted for use in organic 
foods for enrichment or fortification 
when required by regulation or 
recommended by an independent 
professional organization.’’ 2 During the 
deliberations on this recommendation, 
there was discussion about what was 
meant by ‘‘independent professional 
organizations’’ and a clarification was 
made that this recommendation did not 
mean that vitamins and minerals should 
be exempt from the National List 
process. 
The second recommendation entitled 
‘‘Final Recommendation Addendum 
Number 13, The Use of Nutrient 
Supplementation in Organic Food,’’ 
articulated the Board’s preference 
regarding the use of vitamins, minerals, 
and/or accessory nutrients.3 It stated, 
‘‘Upon implementation of the National 
Organic Program (NOP), the use of 
synthetic vitamins, minerals, and/or 
accessory nutrients in products labeled 
as organic must be limited to that which 
is required by regulation or 
recommended for enrichment and 
fortification by independent 
professional associations.’’ The Board 
clarified that the term ‘‘accessory 
nutrients’’ referred to nutrients, ‘‘not 
specifically classified as a vitamin or 
mineral but found to promote optimal 
health.’’ The Board commented that 
excluding the use of accessory nutrients 
could limit the potential for organic 
foods to capitalize on future nutritional 
findings. 
Based on the NOSB’s 
recommendations, the Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS) published a 
proposed rule on March 13, 2000 (65 FR 
13512).4 The rule proposed an 
allowance for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals in processed products labeled 
as ‘‘organic’’ or ‘‘made with organic 
(specified ingredients or food group(s))’’ 
with the following language: ‘‘Nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in accordance 
with 21 CFR 104.20, Nutritional Quality 
Guidelines for Foods.’’ The regulation 
cited as part of this listing refers to the 
fortification policy for food under the 
FDA’s jurisdiction. This policy 
establishes uniform principles for the 
rational addition of nutrients to foods. 
In response to the proposed rule, the 
NOSB submitted a comment 
recommending that 21 CFR 104.20 ‘‘not 
be the reference for the allowance of 
nutrient vitamins and minerals’’, but 
did not provide additional context for 
this position or propose alternate 
regulatory references.5 
On December 21, 2000, AMS 
published a final rule establishing the 
National Organic Program (65 FR 
80548). The final rule retained the 
listing for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals as proposed. In the discussion 
of comments received, the NOP 
acknowledged commenters’ suggestions 
that 21 CFR 104.20 was not adequate 
and should be accompanied by a 
reference to 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) for FDA- 
regulated foods. In the preamble to the 
final rule, the NOP stated that such 
suggestions were not appropriate 
because 21 CFR 101.9 pertained to the 
declaration of nutrition information on 
the label and in labeling of a food rather 
than provisions for nutritional 
supplementation (65 FR 80615). 
However, as discussed below, recent 
consultation with the FDA clarified that 
21 CFR 101.9 does identify essential 
vitamins and minerals. 
In 2006, the NOP received a 
complaint challenging the use of 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
arachidonic acid (ARA) derived from 
algae and microbes, respectively 
(hereinafter referred to as DHA/ARA 
single-cell oils), in organic infant 
formulas.6 The review of the complaint 
also led to questions concerning the use 
of taurine and nucleotides in organic 
infant formula. In November 2006, the 
NOP closed the complaint stating, ‘‘The 
NOP determined that accessory 
nutrients, that are non-agricultural, are 
allowed in the production of products to 
be sold, labeled or represented as 
organic under the NOP; provided, they 
are used in full compliance with Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) rules 
and regulations. Non-agricultural 
accessory nutrients are covered under 
§ 205.602(b) Synthetics allowed, of the 
NOP National List (nutrient vitamins 
and minerals) * * * Nutrients allowed 
under § 205.605(b) are not limited to the 
nutrients listed in [21 CFR] 
§ 104.20(d)(3), because [21 CFR] 
§ 104.20(f) provides that nutrients may 
be added to foods as permitted or 
required by applicable regulations 
established elsewhere by FDA; for 
example, 21 CFR Part 107 Infant 
Formula * * * In summary, we have 
determined that if added ingredients

getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5089727&acct=nosb. 
10 Prior to the April 2011 NOSB meeting, the 
Board indicated that nutrient vitamins and minerals 
would be withdrawn from the agenda and 
postponed until the next meeting in Fall 2011. The 
NOP voiced concern that delaying a sunset vote on 
nutrient vitamins and minerals would not allow 
adequate time to publish proposed and final rules 
to implement the Board’s recommendation prior to 
the sunset date of October 21, 2012. In that 
scenario, the listing for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals would expire and use of synthetic 
vitamins and minerals would be prohibited in 
organic foods. The NOP urged the Board to 
complete the sunset recommendation at the April 
2011 meeting as originally scheduled to allow time 
for completion of rulemaking and to avoid 
significant disruption to the organic food industry. 
The NOSB agreed to retain the nutrient vitamins 
and minerals sunset recommendation on the April 
2011 meeting agenda. 
such as DHA, ARA, nucleotides and 
taurine are used in full compliance with 
FDA rules and regulations, they would 
comply with the NOP National List as 
currently written.’’ 
In November 2008, the NOP received 
an inquiry from a certifying agent 
regarding the allowance of lutein ester 
(crystalline lutein), a carotenoid, under 
the listing for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals in § 205.605(b). The NOP 
consulted with the FDA and provided a 
written response which stated, ‘‘The 
FDA has determined that ‘‘Crystalline 
Lutein’’ does not fall under current 
fortification policy * * * The nutrients 
listed in [21 CFR] § 104.20(d)(3) are 
those that fall under this policy.’’ The 
NOP statement that the ‘‘accessory 
nutrient’’, lutein ester, is not allowed 
under the nutrient vitamin and mineral 
listing at § 205.605(b) is in conflict with 
the 2006 NOP complaint closure letter 
that stated that ‘‘accessory nutrients’’ 
were allowed under the FDA 
fortification policy. 
On March 26, 2010, the NOP 
published an Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to 
announce the pending sunset of 
substances on the National List and 
opened the public comment process on 
whether existing exemptions for 
specified synthetic and nonsynthetic 
substances in organic handling should 
be continued (75 FR 14500).7 The ANPR 
indicated that the exemption for the use 
of nutrient vitamins and minerals as 
ingredients in or on processed products 
labeled as ‘‘organic’’ or ‘‘made with 
organic (specified ingredients or food 
group(s))’’ would expire after October 
21, 2012, if the listing was not renewed. 
The public comment period lasted 60 
days. Comments were received from 
organic handlers, ingredient suppliers 
and trade associations. Comments 
received supported the continued listing 
of nutrient vitamins and minerals in 
organic handling. The written 
comments can be retrieved at http:// 
www.regulations.gov by searching for 
the document ID number: AMS–NOP– 
09–0074. The NOP provided the NOSB 
with these public comments to consider 
in their future deliberations on the 
status of nutrient vitamins and minerals 
in organic products after the 2012 
sunset date. 
Because of continued confusion in the 
organic industry about the allowance of 
certain added ingredients, such as DHA, 
ARA, taurine, and nucleotides, in 
organic products, the NOP met with 
FDA staff from the Office of Nutrition, 
Labeling and Dietary Supplements in 
April 2010 for clarification of the scope 
of 21 CFR 104.20. The FDA explained 
that ‘‘nutrients’’ as referenced in 21 CFR 
104.20(f) is intended to pertain only to 
those nutrients listed in section 
104.20(d)(3) and as specified in the 
standards of identity (21 CFR parts 130– 
169) for a food or class of foods. The 
standards of identity for enriched 
cereal-flours and related products, for 
example, require fortification at 
specified levels with thiamin, 
riboflavin, niacin, iron and folic acid (21 
CFR part 137). The FDA noted that some 
foods have separate requirements, and 
are not subject to 21 CFR 104.20, such 
as infant formula which must comply 
with the nutrient requirements at 21 
CFR 107.100. The NOP participated in 
a follow-up discussion with FDA in 
February 2011, the details of which are 
discussed below. 
In April 2010, the NOP issued an 
‘‘Action Memorandum to the Chairman 
of the National Organic Standards 
Board’’ at the NOSB meeting to advise 
the NOSB about the clarifications 
provided by FDA.8 The memorandum 
conveyed FDA’s interpretation of the 
fortification policy, as stated in the 
above paragraph, and requested that the 
NOSB reexamine the codified listing for 
nutrient vitamins and minerals to 
determine what substances are 
permitted under its scope as part of the 
scheduled sunset 2012 review. The NOP 
specifically asked the NOSB to consider: 
‘‘Are the ‘‘nutrient vitamins and 
minerals’’ specified within 21 CFR 
104.20 aligned with the 1995 NOSB 
recommendation? If not, are there 
substances that should be prohibited or 
additional substances that should be 
allowed?’’ This memo stated that the 
previous interpretation of 21 CFR 
104.20 Nutritional Quality Guidelines 
for Foods was incorrect. The memo also 
conveyed the NOP’s plan to issue 
guidance on nutrient vitamins and 
minerals that would align with the FDA 
fortification policy. On March 9, 2011, 
the NOSB Handling Committee’s Sunset 
2012 Proposed Recommendation for 
nutrient vitamins and minerals was 
posted for public review and comment.9 
The NOSB Handling Committee 
recommended that the listing be 
renewed as follows: 
§ 205.605(b): Nutrient Vitamins and 
Minerals, restricted to materials 
required or allowed by law for the 
purpose of enrichment, 
supplementation or fortification of foods 
including infant formula, and materials 
the use of which is supported by the 
FDA or the Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies.’’ The NOSB 
Handling Committee stated that they 
intended to ‘‘restore the 1995 NOSB 
recommendation,’’ and reasoned that, 
‘‘Review of the original 
recommendations, historical 
documents, and public comments does 
not reveal unacceptable risks to the 
environment, human, or animal health 
as a result of the use or manufacture of 
these materials.’’ 10 
The NOSB Handling Committee 
received approximately 2,000 comments 
on their proposed recommendation to 
change the annotation for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals. The majority of 
comments opposed the NOSB Handling 
Committee’s proposal. Many 
commenters voiced concern that the 
proposal would allow, without NOSB 
review, any synthetic nutrient additive 
to be allowed in organic products. These 
commenters stated that only essential 
nutrients required by the FDA should be 
allowed in organic products. A trade 
organization and an organic nonprofit 
organization specifically suggested that 
the Committee instead consider an 
annotation for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals that would allow essential 
vitamins and minerals required by FDA 
in infant formula and other foods. Some 
commenters further emphasized that the 
Committee’s proposal would allow an 
open ended list of allowed substances. 
These commenters stated that the 
proposal was not consistent with the 
required petition and NOSB review 
process for the National List and, if 
passed, would provide for a list of 
substances that certifying agents would 
have difficulty verifying for compliance

during the organic certification process. 
These commenters advocated for the 
NOSB to individually review and 
approve any synthetic additives not 
provided for on the National List per the 
OFPA requirements. Other comments 
supported the proposal for an allowance 
for nutrient additives based upon the 
idea that certain additives may have 
health benefits and that, without these 
additives, consumers may consider 
organic products nutritionally inferior 
to conventional products. In response to 
these comments, the Committee 
withdrew the proposal prior to the April 
26–30, 2011, NOSB meeting. 
In April 2011, the FDA provided 
written responses to the questions posed 
by NOP concerning whether the FDA 
recognizes or defines ‘‘accessory 
nutrients’’ and the scope of nutrients 
covered under the fortification policy. 
The letter, dated April 14, 2011, reflects 
the points of discussion during a 
February 2011 meeting between NOP 
and FDA.11 FDA’s responses reiterated 
and expanded upon the information 
conveyed during an April 2010 NOSB 
meeting at which the NOP discussed 
their understanding of FDA’s 
fortification policy. 
The FDA explained that the 
fortification policy at 21 CFR 104.20 
provides for the rational addition of 
essential nutrients to food for human 
consumption and the term, ‘‘accessory 
nutrients,’’ is not defined or used in the 
fortification policy. FDA considers only 
‘‘essential nutrients’’ to be within the 
scope of its fortification policy at 21 
CFR 104.20. The nutrients which FDA 
has determined to be essential are 
enumerated in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) 
with corresponding Reference Daily 
Intakes (RDIs), and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(9), 
which includes protein and potassium 
and the corresponding Daily Reference 
Values (DRVs). FDA stated that 
substances identified by USDA as 
‘‘accessory nutrients’’ such as omega-3 
and omega-6 fatty acids, inositol, 
choline, carnitine, and taurine are not 
essential nutrients listed under 
101.9(c)(8)(iv) and are, therefore, not 
within the scope of FDA’s fortification 
policy at 21 CFR 104.20. The FDA also 
clarified that infant formula is not 
within the scope of the fortification 
policy; the requirements in 21 CFR part 
107 pertain to required and essential 
nutrients for infant formula and include 
minimum and maximum amounts for 
those nutrients. 
At the April 2011 NOSB meeting, the 
NOP suggested that the NOSB amend 
the annotation for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals to cite the regulatory 
references, 21 CFR 101.9, 21 CFR 107.10 
and 21 CFR 107.100, which identify 
essential and approved vitamins, 
minerals and other nutrients for infant 
formula and fortification of food. The 
NOP suggested that an annotation 
change would correct an inaccurate 
cross reference to FDA fortification 
policy for food at 21 CFR 104.20. The 
NOP further explained that this 
annotation change would expand the 
allowance for certain nutrients by 
providing for the continued use of 
essential nutrients in organic infant 
formula; the use of essential nutrients in 
infant formula is not covered under the 
existing FDA reference in the NOP 
regulations. The NOP also stated that 
the listing for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals should encompass a clear, 
discernible list of permitted substances. 
The proposed change would convey the 
intent of the codified listing by 
coherently and accurately stating which 
synthetic nutrient substances may be 
added to organic food and organic infant 
formula. 
At the conclusion of the April 2011 
meeting, the NOSB approved a 
recommendation to renew the listing for 
nutrient vitamins and minerals as 
presently codified without 
amendment.12 The Board signaled its 
intent to propose an annotation change 
to the nutrient vitamins and minerals 
listing at its November 2011 meeting, 
after considering the information 
provided by FDA and the numerous 
public comments addressing this issue. 
However, since NOP is taking action to 
amend the listing through this proposed 
rule, the NOSB has opted to remove 
proposing a recommendation for an 
annotation change on nutrient vitamins 
and minerals from their November 2011 
meeting agenda. In addition to the 
ANPR for Sunset 2012 published on 
March 26, 2010, the NOSB received 
additional public comment concerning 
the pending sunset of this listing in 
response to three Federal Register 
notices announcing meetings of the 
NOSB and its planned deliberations on 
recommendations involving Sunset 
2012 substances. The notices were 
published in the Federal Register as 
follows: March 17, 2010 (75 FR 12723), 
September 20, 2010 (75 FR 57194), and 
March 4, 2011 (76 FR 12013). The NOSB 
received further written and oral 
testimony concerning nutrient vitamins 
and minerals at all three of these public 
business meetings which occurred in 
Woodland, CA on April 26–29, 2010, in 
Madison, WI on October 25–28, 2010, 
and in Seattle, WA on April 26–29, 
2011. The written comments can be 
retrieved via http://www.regulations.gov 
by searching for the document ID 
numbers: AMS–NOP–10–0021 (May 
2010 meeting); AMS–NOP–10–0068 
(October 2010 meeting); and AMS– 
NOP–11–05 (April 2011 meeting). The 
oral comments were recorded in the 
meeting transcripts available on the 
NOP Web site, http:// 
www.ams.usda.gov/nop. 
II. Overview of Proposed Amendments 
This proposed rule would amend 
§ 205.605 of the National List 
regulations by amending paragraph (b) 
that currently reads: ‘‘Nutrient vitamins 
and minerals, in accordance with 21 
CFR 104.20, Nutritional Quality 
Guidelines For Foods’’ to be revised as 
follows: ‘‘Vitamins and minerals. For 
food—vitamins and minerals identified 
as essential in 21 CFR 101.9. For infant 
formula—vitamins and minerals as 
required by 21 CFR 107.100 or 107.10.’’ 
This proposed change conveys the 
intent of the codified listing by 
coherently and accurately stating which 
synthetic nutrient substances may be 
added to organic food and organic infant 
formula. The parameters of the amended 
listing are based upon FDA’s 
determination of which vitamins and 
minerals are essential for human 
nutrition and required in infant formula 
which is consistent with the intended 
purpose of the current listing. Nutrients 
which are not considered essential 
vitamins and minerals, by the FDA 
(under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), would be 
subject to individual evaluation in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in 
sections 6517(c) and 6518(m) of OFPA 
and § 205.600 of the NOP regulations. 
Petitions for the addition of such 
substances to the National List need to 
be submitted in accordance with the 
Guidelines on Submitting National List 
Petitions (72 FR 2167).13 
The NOP regulations as promulgated, 
contained the listing for ‘‘Nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in accordance 
with 21 CFR 104.20, Nutritional Quality 
Guidelines for Foods,’’ in § 205.605(b) of 
the National List. In effect, that 
provision permits the addition of 
synthetic forms of nutrient vitamins and

1984 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 8 / Thursday, January 12, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
14 Section 205.606 of the National List identifies 
two components of fish oil, by Chemical Abstracts 
Service (CAS) numbers, that are allowed as 
ingredients in organic products. These are the 
omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Forms of DHA 
which do not meet these criteria are not otherwise 
allowed in organic products as a nutrient vitamin 
or mineral, regardless of GRAS designation. FDA 
has not determined that either DHA or ARA are 
essential nutrients for the fortification of food. Pet 
food does not fall within the scope of FDA’s 
fortification policy. The NOP will address nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in pet food through a 
separate rulemaking. 
minerals to processed products labeled 
‘‘organic’’ or ‘‘made with organic 
(specified ingredients or food 
group(s)).’’ However, the NOP 
incorrectly interpreted FDA’s 
fortification policy, codified at 21 CFR 
104.20, and allowed substances that are 
not authorized under the current 
reference in the NOP regulations. 
Two sections, 21 CFR 104.20(d)(3) 
and (f), have caused confusion and 
incorrect interpretations of which 
substances are allowed in organic foods. 
Section 104.20(d)(3) identifies 21 
nutrients (19 vitamins and minerals 
with a Recommended Dietary Intake 
(RDI), plus protein and potassium 
which each have a Dietary Reference 
Value (DRV)) which may be added to 
foods in accordance with conditions 
specified within section 104.20. The 
FDA fortification policy specifies the 
circumstances under which these 21 
nutrients may be added to food: To 
correct a dietary insufficiency; restore 
nutrients to a level representative of the 
food prior to storage, handling and 
processing; maintain a balanced 
nutrient profile; improve the quality or 
a replacement food; or be added as 
permitted or required by another FDA 
regulation. In the context of organic 
production, the fortification policy 
referenced in the current nutrient 
vitamins and minerals listing covers 
only the vitamins and minerals 
identified in § 104.20(d)(3). 
In 2006, the NOP incorrectly 
interpreted 21 CFR 104.20(f), which 
states, ‘‘Nutrient(s) may be added to 
foods as permitted or required by 
applicable regulations established 
elsewhere in this chapter.’’ The NOP 
interpreted ‘‘or required by applicable 
regulations established elsewhere in this 
chapter,’’ as allowing the addition of a 
broader range of nutrients to organic 
products than those specified in 
§ 104.20(d)(3). According to this 
interpretation, the fortification policy 
for food included the nutrition 
specifications for infant formula and 
nutrients for which there is Generally 
Regarded as Safe (GRAS) notification or 
the manufacturer’s self-determination of 
GRAS. The FDA maintains a GRAS 
Notice Inventory: http://www.fda.gov/ 
Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/ 
GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/ 
GRASListings/default.htm. 
Fortification of Foods 
To correct the previous interpretation 
and provide firm guidance to the 
organic industry, the NOP sought 
clarification from FDA regarding the 
scope of nutrients, vitamins and 
minerals permitted by the fortification 
policy for addition to foods. The FDA 
informed the NOP that the fortification 
policy covers the nutrients identified in 
(i) 21 CFR 104.20(d)(3), (ii) an 
additional 6 nutrients that have been 
determined essential listed in 21 CFR 
101.9(c)(8)(iv), and (iii) nutrients as 
required by other FDA regulations, 
which include those pertaining to a 
common or usual name (21 CFR part 
102), standard of identity (21 CFR parts 
130–169), or nutritional quality 
guideline (21 CFR 104.47). This 
contrasts with current practices in 
certain sectors of the organic industry 
which have added nutrients to types of 
organic products, such as infant formula 
or pet food, which are not covered 
under the fortification policy. Added 
ingredients which are confirmed or self- 
determined as GRAS, but not designated 
as essential nutrients by FDA, have also 
been added to organic products. 
Examples of ingredients added to 
organic products which are outside the 
parameters of FDAs fortification policy 
include certain forms of DHA and ARA 
in fluid milk and dairy products, and 
taurine in pet food.14 
Since the establishment of the 
fortification policy in 1980, the FDA has 
designated six other nutrients as 
‘‘essential’’ and permitted for 
fortification in foods. These include 
Vitamin K, manganese, selenium, 
chromium, molybdenum and chloride. 
As indicated in 21 CFR 104.20(a), the 
list of nutrients in (d)(3) was not 
expected to remain static: ‘‘It is 
reasonable to anticipate that the 
Reference Daily Intakes (RDI’s) as 
delineated in § 101.9 of this chapter and 
in paragraph (d) of this section will be 
amended from time to time to list 
additional nutrients and/or to change 
the levels of specific RDI’s as improved 
knowledge about human nutrient 
requirements and allowances develops.’’ 
Therefore, the FDA suggested to NOP 
that a more appropriate reference to 
capture all of the essential vitamins and 
minerals that may be permitted for 
fortification of food, in accordance with 
the conditions specified in the 
fortification policy, is 21 CFR 
101.9(c)(8)(iv) and potassium 
(101.9(c)(9)). The NOP is proposing to 
amend the current listing for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals to include this 
reference for fortification of foods. 
Paragraph (c)(8)(iv) in § 101.9 identifies 
25 vitamins and minerals which are 
essential in human nutrition and their 
corresponding Reference Daily Intake 
(RDI) values. Paragraph (c)(9) in § 101.9 
includes the listing for potassium and 
the corresponding Daily Reference 
Value (DRV). The RDI and potassium 
DRV values specified in 21 CFR 101.9 
are based on the National Academy of 
Sciences’ Recommended Daily 
Allowance and ‘‘Estimated Safe and 
Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes.’’ The 
NOP expects that the NOSB will review 
any FDA updates or additions 
pertaining to the requirements for 
essential vitamins and minerals, as 
codified in 21 CFR 101.9, during future 
sunset reviews of the vitamins and 
minerals listing. 
Infant Formula 
The NOP is also proposing to amend 
the current listing for nutrient vitamins 
and minerals by adding the regulatory 
references that are applicable to the 
FDA nutrient specifications for infant 
formula. According to FDA, the 
fortification policy for food does not 
apply to infant formula. The FDA 
developed separate nutrient 
specifications for infant formula. The 
NOP allowance for nutrient vitamins 
and minerals, as codified, references 
only the fortification policy for food, 
and, therefore, does not provide for the 
addition of vitamins and minerals in 
organic infant formula. 
In practice, however, NOP-certified 
organic infant formulas which comply 
with the FDA nutrient requirements 
have been produced for years. This was 
based upon an interpretation advanced 
by the NOP that the FDA fortification 
policy extended to the nutrient 
specifications for infant formula. Most 
of the organic infant formulas in the 
current marketplace contain some 
added ingredients which are permitted, 
but not required by FDA, such as, ARA, 
DHA, nucleotides, taurine, carnitine, 
lutein and lycopene. This proposed 
action, incorporating the FDA nutrient 
requirements for infant formula, would 
ensure that there is no unintended 
impediment to the continued 
formulation of organic infant formula 
with vitamins and minerals to comply 
with FDA requirements. This proposed 
action would also prohibit the use of 
non-required ingredients added to 
organic infant formula, such as ARA, 
DHA, nucleotides, taurine, carnitine, 
lutein, and lycopene, unless the NOSB 
issues recommendations to add any 
such substances to the National List and

1985 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 8 / Thursday, January 12, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
such recommendations are codified 
through rulemaking. 
The infant formula nutrient 
specifications at 21 CFR 107.100 
stipulate the required vitamins and 
minerals and the corresponding 
minimum and maximum levels at 
which these may be present in infant 
formula. Section 21 CFR 107.100 
identifies all required vitamins and 
minerals for infant formula with the 
exception of selenium, the addition of 
which is allowed for in 21 CFR 107.10. 
Paragraph (b)(5) of section 107.10 
provides that any additional vitamin or 
mineral may be declared on the label 
provided it has been identified as 
essential by the National Academy of 
Sciences or FDA and is provided at a 
level, if known, considered to have 
biological significance through 
publications by the National Academy 
of Sciences or by FDA in the Federal 
Register. Selenium has been identified 
as essential by the National Academy of 
Sciences. The FDA advised that sections 
107.100 and 107.10, in combination, 
would account for all of the vitamins 
and minerals required in infant formula. 
The incorporation of section 107.10 will 
ensure that any vitamins and minerals 
which are declared essential and added 
to infant formula in the future will be 
allowed in organic infant formula. This 
will enable manufacturers of organic 
infant formula to apply significant 
nutritional findings concerning vitamin 
and mineral requirements without 
delay. Section 107.100 also requires 
certain levels of protein, fat and linoleic 
acid in infant formula. As these 
nutrients are available from agricultural 
sources, the NOP expects that these will 
be provided in organic form. 
As a result of this proposed action, 
the essential vitamins and minerals 
listed as RDI in 101.9(c)(8)(iv) and 
potassium listed as DRV (101.9(c)(9)) 
would be permitted for addition to 
organic foods; in addition, the vitamins 
and minerals required by FDA for infant 
formula, would be permitted for 
addition to organic infant formula. An 
essential vitamin or mineral must have 
a safe and lawful source, e.g., the 
substance must be an approved food 
additive or GRAS under the conditions 
of the intended use, and there should be 
no determination by FDA, in regulation 
or matter of policy, that fortification 
with that nutrient is inappropriate. To 
convey that vitamins and minerals are 
the only types of substances permitted 
under this categorical allowance, the 
proposed amendment omits the word 
‘‘nutrient’’ because that term 
encompasses a wider range of 
substances. 
Over the last ten years, the NOP 
incorrectly allowed a broad allowance 
of ‘‘accessory nutrients’’ that is not 
aligned with the codified allowance for 
nutrient vitamins and minerals in 
organic products, as confirmed by 
FDA’s clarification of the scope of the 
fortification policy. In practice, added 
ingredients, which are considered GRAS 
(either via GRAS notification 
submission or a manufacturer’s self- 
determination), but are not designated 
as essential vitamins and minerals per 
FDA (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), are being 
added to organic products based upon 
an incorrect NOP interpretation of FDA 
fortification policy. The proposed action 
will clarify which vitamins and 
minerals are allowed in organic food 
products, allow organic infant formula 
to contain essential vitamins and 
minerals, and ensure the NOSB reviews 
and approves all substances used in 
organic production and handling. 
Moreover, this proposed action does not 
preclude the potential to add individual 
exemptions for additional nutrients to 
the National List. Such substances can 
be petitioned for inclusion on the 
National List and would be subject to 
individual evaluation by the NOSB 
according to the criteria established in 
OFPA and the NOP regulations for such 
purpose. 
In effect, this proposed action would 
permit the following vitamins and 
minerals in organic foods (in accordance 
with FDA specifications for use): 
Vitamins A, C, K, D, E, thiamin, 
riboflavin, niacin, B6, B12, biotin, 
folate, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, 
phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iodine, 
copper, potassium, selenium, 
manganese, chromium, molybdenum, 
and chloride. This proposed action 
would also permit the following 
vitamins and minerals in organic infant 
formula: Vitamins A, C, K, D, E, 
thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, B6, B12, 
biotin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, 
choline, inositol, calcium, iron, 
phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iodine, 
copper, sodium, potassium, selenium, 
manganese, and chloride. Table 1 
compares the vitamins and minerals 
allowed under the current 21 CFR 
104.20 reference and illustrates the 
complete set of vitamins and minerals 
that would be permitted in organic food 
and infant formula per this proposed 
action.

III. Related Documents 
Three notices were published 
announcing meetings of the NOSB and 
its planned deliberations on 
recommendations involving Sunset 
2012 substances including nutrient 
vitamins and minerals. The notices were 
published in the Federal Register as 
follows: (1) March 17, 2010 (75 FR 
12723); (2) September 20, 2010 (75 FR 
57194); and (3) March 4, 2011 (76 FR 
12013). 
On March 26, 2010, the NOP 
published an Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (75 FR 14500) to 
make the public aware that the 
allowance for synthetic nutrient 
vitamins and minerals, among other 
substances, will expire for use in 
organic handling, if not reviewed by the 
NOSB and renewed by the Secretary. 
IV. Statutory and Regulatory Authority 
The OFPA, as amended [7 U.S.C. 
6501–6522], authorizes the Secretary to 
make amendments to the National List 
based on proposed amendments 
developed by the NOSB. Section 
6518(k) and 6518(n) of OFPA authorize 
the NOSB to develop proposed 
amendments to the National List for 
submission to the Secretary and 
establish a petition process by which 
persons may petition the NOSB for the 
purpose of having a substances 
evaluated for inclusion on or deletion 
from the National List. The current 
petition process (72 FR 2167, January 
18, 2007) can be accessed through the 
NOP Web site at: http:// 
www.ams.usda.gov/nop. The Sunset 
Provision in section 6517(e) of the 
OFPA provides that no exemption or 
prohibition on the National List will 
remain valid after 5 years unless the 
exemption or prohibition has been 
reviewed and the Secretary renews the 
listing. 
A. Executive Order 12866 and Executive 
Order 13563 
Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, 
and of promoting flexibility. This rule 
has been designated an ‘‘economically 
significant regulatory action’’ under

published in the Federal Register on March 26, 
2010 (75 FR 14500) and requested comments. Three 
NOSB meeting notices also provided opportunity 
for public comment on this issue. The notices were 
published in the Federal Register as follows: March 
17, 2010 (75 FR 12723), September 20, 2010 (75 FR

section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. 
Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget. 
AMS is specifically seeking comments 
on the actual economic impacts of this 
action on the industry, including any 
expected mitigation factors that the 
industry may use to comply with the 
proposed action. We are most interested 
in refining the upper limit estimates 
referenced in the Regulatory Impact 
Analysis to specify the actual costs and 
benefits of this proposal. The costs and 
benefits are summarized in Table 3, 
below, and described in detail in this 
section. Comments on the proportion of 
sales for different sectors of the organic 
market (i.e. infant formula, baby food, 
fluid milk, breakfast cereals, and pet 
food) that will be impacted by this 
action would be pertinent. 
TABLE 3—SUMMARY OF COSTS AND BENEFITS 
Costs (range) Benefits 
$500 million–$4.2 billion ........................................................................... Establishes a clear, finite list of essential and required vitamins and 
mineral for use in organic food and infant formula. 
Facilitates the use of essential or required vitamins and minerals in or-
ganic food and infant formula. 
The upper limit is the upper limit for sales of product categories that 
would be impacted by this action.
Fosters certainty in determining whether a specific ingredient can be 
used in an organic product. 
Facilitates enforcement of organic product composition standards. 
Need for the Rule 
The National List within the NOP 
regulations provides for the use of 
‘‘Nutrient vitamins and minerals, in 
accordance with 21 CFR 104.20, 
Nutritional Quality Guidelines For 
Foods,’’ under 7 CFR 205.605(b). The 
reference to 21 CFR 104.20 is to FDA’s 
fortification policy. In 2006, the NOP 
asserted that the scope of the FDA 
fortification policy provided for the use 
of a broader range of nutrients than 
those explicitly listed in those 
guidelines. The NOP interpretation 
affected an allowance for ‘‘accessory 
nutrients,’’ permitting the use of 
substances which are Generally 
Recognized As Safe (GRAS), but are 
neither vitamin or mineral, nor required 
by regulation. In 2010, the NOP 
consulted with FDA to clarify the 
parameters of the fortification policy 
and confirmed that the NOP 
interpretation did not align with the 
intent of the FDA guidelines. The FDA 
clarified that the fortification policy 
provides for the use of only essential 
vitamins and minerals (under 21 CFR 
101.9(c)(8)(iv)) plus potassium and 
protein (21 CFR 101.9 (c)(9)), which is 
a more prescribed set of substances than 
permitted under the NOP interpretation 
of that policy.15 
The NOP’s interpretation facilitated 
the potential for the use of a wide 
spectrum of substances, having unique 
properties and functions. It incorrectly 
suggested to organic producers and 
handlers that a number of unspecified 
substances could qualify for use under 
the nutrient vitamins and minerals 
exemption and be added to organic 
products. It also suggests that the 
exemption provides an allowance for an 
open list of substances, potentially 
encompassing dozens of nutrients, the 
complete inventory of which is difficult 
for the NOP and consumers to discern. 
As a result, the existing exemption 
remains vulnerable to misinterpretation, 
which undermines the ability of the 
certifying agents and NOP to make 
consistent decisions about the use of 
nutrient substances in organic products. 
It is imperative to eliminate uncertainty 
and enable organic operations to make 
confident business decisions and to 
demonstrate effective oversight of 
organic production to maintain 
consumer trust. 
Furthermore, the NOP thought that 
the fortification policy provided for the 
addition of nutrients to infant formula. 
The FDA indicated that this was 
inaccurate as the nutrient specifications 
for infant formula, provided at 21 CFR 
part 107, are separate from the 
fortification policy at 21 CFR 104.20. 
Absent this reference to 21 CFR part 
107, the NOP regulations do not 
correctly provide for the formulation of 
infant formula that would meet FDA 
requirements. Therefore, this action is 
also necessary to incorporate the correct 
FDA citation with respect to the 
addition of required vitamins and 
minerals to organic infant formula. 
The NOP and NOSB have provided 
four opportunities for public comment 
on this issue and the total number of 
comments submitted exceeds two 
thousand.16 Public comment surged in 
response to the NOSB April 2011 
meeting notice which announced that 
the NOSB Handling Committee would 
present a recommendation for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals. The NOSB 
Handling Committee recommended that 
the listing be renewed as follows: 
‘‘§ 205.605(b): Nutrient Vitamins and 
Minerals, restricted to materials 
required or allowed by law for the 
purpose of enrichment, 
supplementation or fortification of foods 
including infant formula, and materials 
the use of which is supported by the 
FDA or the Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies.’’ As described 
earlier, the majority of comments 
opposed the NOSB Handling 
Committee’s proposal. Some expressed 
the preference for a complete 
prohibition on nutrient additives in 
organic products, while others 
advocated for the review of each 
individual nonagricultural substance for 
inclusion on the National List. This 
proposed rule is responsive to 
numerous public comments advocating 
for a clearly defined exemption. 
Regulatory Objective 
The primary purpose of this proposed 
action is to clarify and accurately 
provide for the parameters of the 
exemption for the use of nutrient 
vitamins and minerals in organic

products in accordance with FDA 
regulatory provisions. The FDA 
fortification policy is referenced in the 
current listing to establish parameters 
for what nutrient vitamins and minerals 
may be used in organic handling. The 
proposed rule would correct the 
regulatory references to clearly delineate 
that only essential vitamins and 
minerals are permitted in organic foods 
under this exemption. This proposed 
action would correctly identify FDA 
required vitamins and minerals that 
may be added to organic infant formula. 
Other synthetic substances that are not 
specifically referenced by the proposed 
exemption would be prohibited from 
use in organic products unless there is 
an explicit National List exemption for 
such use. 
This action would clarify for 
certifying agents, organic operations, 
consumers, and other interested persons 
which vitamins and minerals are 
permitted for use in organic products. It 
would also ensure that other nutrient 
substances are subject to the thorough 
and public review that is accorded all 
substances petitioned for addition to the 
National List. 
Alternatives Considered 
Alternatives to this proposed 
rulemaking that were considered 
include: (1) Renew the existing listing 
for nutrient vitamins and minerals; or 
(2) in lieu of a rule, issue guidance 
stating NOP’s intent to interpret the 
current listing for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals as proposed in this action. 
The first alternative considered was to 
renew the listing for ‘‘Nutrient vitamins 
and minerals, in accordance with 21 
CFR 104.20, Nutritional Quality 
Guidelines For Foods,’’ without change 
would extend the National List 
exemption for the use of nutrient 
vitamins and minerals until the next 
sunset date of October 21, 2017. The 
current listing contains an inaccurate 
reference to FDA’s fortification policy 
for food, the scope of which the NOP 
erroneously interpreted to be broader 
than intended by the original NOSB 
1995 recommendations on the nutrient 
fortification of foods. This option would 
leave in place a regulatory provision 
that remains vulnerable to 
misinterpretation regarding what 
substances are permitted in organic 
products. Failing to take action could 
perpetuate business decisions that are 
based on an inaccurate reading of the 
fortification policy resulting in the use 
of various ingredients which are not 
explicitly provided for on the National 
List. The continued use of synthetic 
ingredients which do not appear on the 
National List, whether by renewing the 
current listing or grandfathering in the 
affected substances, is not a plausible 
option because this is inconsistent with 
the Organic Foods Production Act of 
1990. The statute prohibits the Secretary 
from allowing synthetics substances in 
the National List other than those 
proposed by the National Organic 
Standards Board (7 U.S.C. 6517(d)(2)). 
Only the NOSB has the authority to 
recommend adding a synthetic 
substance to the National List and 
grandfathering in these substances 
would bypass the NOSB review process 
which is mandated in order for such 
substances to be used in organic 
handling. In addition, pursuing this 
alternative runs counter to the 
prevailing public support, as expressed 
through comments to the Sunset 2012 
ANPR and the NOSB meeting notices, 
for NOP action to precisely clarify the 
permitted nutrient vitamins and 
minerals in organic handling. 
Furthermore, the NOP is now 
cognizant that the FDA fortification 
policy does not cover infant formula. 
Infant formula is comprised of 
agricultural products and falls within 
the scope of NOP certification. It has 
developed into a robust organic product 
category and recorded a 2.3 percent 
growth in sales in 2010.17 The NOP 
believes that it is imperative to confirm 
the eligibility of infant formula for 
organic certification by accurately 
providing for the use of vitamins and 
minerals to meet FDA requirements for 
infant formula. Therefore, the NOP did 
not believe this alternative was 
appropriate. 
The second alternative considered 
would result in the issuance of 
guidance, rather than a regulatory 
change. Upon receiving FDA 
clarification on the fortification policy, 
the NOP considered conveying which 
nutrient vitamins and minerals would 
be permitted in organic processed food 
through guidance. However, upon 
further review, the NOP believes that 
this route would not adequately address 
the issue of correcting the incomplete 
and inaccurate FDA references in the 
regulatory annotations as well as the 
resultant overly broad NOP 
interpretations. The NOP believes that 
correcting the inaccuracies in the 
regulation is preferable and the 
appropriate course of action to bring 
certainty to the vitamins and mineral 
area of organic food production. 
Baseline 
Based on USDA data from the 
Economic Research Service (ERS), the 
total acreage of certified organic land 
grew from 1.8 million acres in 2000 to 
4.8 million acres in 2008, of which 
approximately 2.2 million acres was 
pasture and rangeland.18 The number of 
certified organic producers in the U.S. 
nearly doubled in that time period 
rising from approximately 7,000 in 2000 
to nearly 13,000 in 2008.19 
The increasing production capacity 
for organic agricultural products 
parallels growth trends in sales of 
organic products. Since implementation 
of the NOP, the organic industry has 
experienced consecutive years of growth 
demonstrated by increasing sales to 
consumers. In 2010, U.S. retail sales of 
organic food and beverages totaled $26.7 
billion.20 The pace of double-digit sales 
growth that persisted from 2002–2008 
has dipped, but the 7.7 percent growth 
recorded from 2009–2010, marked an 
increase from the previous year. The top 
grossing organic food categories in terms 
of sales for 2010 are fruits and 
vegetables (39.7%), dairy (14.6%) and 
packaged/prepared foods, which 
includes baby formula and baby food 
(13.9%). Sales of dry breakfast goods, 
which includes cereals, grew 3.0% in 
the year 2010, exceeding $1 million. 
Organic frozen prepared foods account 
for the highest sales within the 
packaged/prepared foods category. 
According to the Organic Trade 
Association’s Organic Industry Survey 
2011, the most often cited barrier to 
growth in this category, is rising 
commodity costs.21 
The year-to-year increases in sales of 
organic foods coincides with changes in 
marketing, as organic products have 
become increasingly available through 
conventional marketing channels, in 
addition to natural product retailers. In 
2006, nearly equal shares of organic 
products were sold in conventional 
venues and natural product outlets and 
by 2010, the balance shifted to mass- 
market groceries which sold 54 percent 
of organic food.22 There is also evidence 
of a shift in consumer purchasing 
patterns, expanding beyond the 
traditional consumption of organic 
fruits and vegetables to other organic 
products, such as dairy, beverages, 
packaged foods, and breads and

organic food categories which 
experienced the greatest sales growth in 
2010 were dairy, condiments, snack 
foods, and breads and grains.24 
This Regulatory Impact Analysis 
(RIA) focuses on five product categories 
in which the NOP believes the impact 
of the proposed rule will be 
concentrated: infant formula; baby food; 
milk; breakfast cereal; and pet food. The 
NOP used the Organic Trade 
Association’s April 2011 White Paper 
on the Fortification of Organic Foods to 
identify several product categories that 
would likely be impacted by regulatory 
action with respect to the listing for 
nutrient vitamins and minerals.25 A 
fuller description of current fortification 
in these products is provided in the 
discussion of costs below. Table 4 
provides an overview of the recent 
market statistics for these product 
categories.

Benefits to the Proposed Rule 
The current regulatory provisions 
present challenges to certifying agents 
and organic operations in complying 
with and enforcing regulations 
regarding the use of nutrient vitamins 
and minerals. In April 2010, the NOP 
informed certifying agents of the 
corrected interpretation of the FDA 
fortification policy and the impact on 
the exemption for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals.26 This proposed correction 
provides certifying agents with a more 
clear direction for future certification 
decisions concerning vitamins, minerals 
and other substances in organic product 
formulations. Further, this proposed 
action also would ensure that 
exemptions for the use of vitamins, 
minerals and other nutrients are subject 
to NOSB evaluation in accordance with 
the criteria established in 7 U.S.C. 
6518(m). Finally, the proposed 
amendment also would correct the 
regulation with regard to infant formula 
under the NOP. Organic infant formula 
has been marketed since the 
implementation of the NOP regulations 
in 2002. The current NOP regulations, 
however, do not specifically provide a 
correct reference for the use of vitamins 
and minerals required by FDA in 
organic infant formula. 
This proposed action would facilitate 
the use of any additional vitamins or 
minerals that the FDA may determine to 
be required or essential for human 
nutrition. The FDA regulatory citations, 
21 CFR 101.9, 107.100 and 107.10, that 
would replace the current reference to 
21 CFR 104.20, contain lists of vitamins 
and minerals for food and infant 
formula. The lists within these sections 
are updated as warranted to incorporate 
additional nutrients which FDA has 
designated as essential or required. For 
example, since the implementation of 
the fortification policy in 1980, the FDA 
has modified the list of essential 
nutrients to include vitamin K, 
manganese, selenium, chromium, 
molybdenum and chloride. By 
including the proposed references to 21 
CFR 101.9, 107.100 and 107.10, any 
essential or required vitamins and 
minerals which are added to those 
regulations would also be allowed for 
use in organic food and infant formula. 
During the sunset review of the 
proposed listing for vitamins and 
minerals, the NOSB would review any 
updates to the vitamins and minerals 
listed in those sections. 
Costs of Proposed Rule 
This action would impact any 
certified organic operation which adds 
substances to organic products that are 
not essential vitamins and minerals for 
human nutrition, as enumerated in 21 
CFR 101.9, or required vitamins and 
minerals for infant formula, as 
enumerated in 21 CFR 107.100 and 
107.10. Based on information provided 
in the OTA White Paper on the 
Fortification of Organic Foods, the 
impacts would be concentrated within 5 
categories of organic products discussed 
herein in which nutrient 
supplementation has been more 
prevalent: infant formula, baby food, 
milk, breakfast cereal, and pet food. In 
aggregate, we anticipate that the upper 
limit for sales of the organic product 
categories affected by this proposed 
action would be $4.1 billion. We 
emphasize that this is an estimated 
upper limit that reflects the total sales 
of the 5 categories of organic products. 
Because AMS believes that only a subset 
of these sales would be impacted by this 
action, the actual costs of mitigation to 
comply with the regulatory change are 
expected to be significantly lower than 
the total sales value. However, the AMS 
does not have sufficient data to estimate 
these costs and is therefore seeking 
public comment to further analyze the 
costs of the final rule. OTA provided a 
conservative estimate that the economic 
impact of fortified organic product sales 
is in the range of $500 million annually. 
However, it is not possible for AMS to 
evaluate the accuracy of this estimate 
due to the use of proprietary data and 
lack of information of what assumptions 
were used to determine this economic 
impact.

1990 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 8 / Thursday, January 12, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
27 According to NOP research, it appears that 
there are 5 major entities which offer organic infant 
formula exclusively with DHA algal oil and ARA 
single-cell oil. Three of the five also market 
nonorganic infant formulas; therefore, the impact of 
this action to each entity could be buffered by 
sustained business related to the nonorganic 
formulas. Data from ERS which shows that organic 
infant formulas have a minimal share, 0.8 percent, 
of the total infant formula market supports the 
prediction of a more limited impact on the entities 
which offer both organic and nonorganic formulas. 
28 ERS determined this number from Neilsen 
Scantrack data which contains weekly sales 
information from a sample of over 14,000 U.S. 
grocery stores. 
29 ERS determined the market share for organic 
baby food by using data from Neilsen Scantrack, 
which contains weekly sales information from a 
sample of over 14,000 U.S. grocery stores. 
30 For the purpose of labeling, the amount/levels 
of essential vitamins and minerals in 21 CFR 
101.9(c)(8)(iv) are for 4 years and above. Foods that 
are represented for use for infants (up to 12 months 
of age), children 1 to 4 years of age, pregnant or 
lactating women, must use the Recommended Daily 
Intakes that are specified for the intended group. 
31 This estimate does not include potential 
impacts to organic yogurt. The NOP believes such 
impact would be minimal as there appears to be 
very few organic yogurt products on the market 
which contain DHA algal oil. Organic yogurt which 
contains DHA derived from fish oil is available; this 
is acceptable for use in organic production 
currently and under this proposed action. 
32 ERS determined this estimate by utilizing data 
from the Gladson UPC (Universal Product Code) 
database which contains 160,000 food UPC codes 
and detailed nutritional information. The 2.8% 
estimate is based on 2010 data. ERS searched that 
database for organic milk products containing one 
or more of the 11 nutrients specified by the NOP: 
docosaheaxaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid 
(ARA), taurine, inositol, choline, ascorbyl 
palmitate, beta-carotene, carnitine, lycopene, 
nucleotides, and lutein. 
33 NOP analysis of milk prices revealed that 
organic whole milk with added DHA generally 
ranged from 30 to 80 cents higher than prices for 
organic whole milk. 
34 The Organic Trade Association 2011 Organic 
Industry Survey attributes the strong growth of the 
The following discussion explains the 
basis for AMS’s estimate by product 
category, any underlying assumptions 
and potential mitigating factors. 
Infant Formula. Organic handlers 
which are not in compliance with this 
proposed rule would be required to 
reformulate or relabel their products or 
exit the organic infant formula market.27 
According to measurements by the 
USDA Economic Research Service, 99.5 
percent of organic infant formula 
contained DHA/ARA as of the first 
quarter in 2009.28 The NOP assumes 
that the percentage of organic infant 
formula containing DHA algal oil and 
ARA single-cell oil has not fluctuated 
and for the purposes of this analysis, 
that essentially all organic infant 
formula contains DHA algal oil and 
ARA single-cell oil. The OTA reported 
that sales of organic infant formula were 
$689 million in 2010. Therefore, we 
anticipate that the entire $689 million 
organic infant formula industry would 
be impacted by this proposed action. 
AMS believes the estimate impact of 
this proposed action on organic infant 
formula may be inflated for several 
reasons. At the April 2011 NOSB 
meeting, the NOP informed the organic 
industry that the prior NOP 
interpretation of the listing for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals was incorrect. 
The NOP indicated its intent to 
implement the fortification policy, 
referenced in the codified listing as 21 
CFR 104.20, in accordance with FDA’s 
interpretation of that policy . The NOP 
also advised that other substances could 
be petitioned for addition to the 
National List. Since that announcement, 
six petitions have been submitted for 
substances that are added to organic 
infant formula, but are not required by 
FDA. As of the publication of this 
proposed action, petitions for the 
following substances have been 
submitted to the NOP: DHA algal oil, 
ARA single-cell oil, taurine, choline, 
inositol, ascorbyl palmitate, beta- 
carotene, L-carnitine, lycopene, 
nucleotides, lutein and L-methionine. 
The NOSB will consider the petitions 
for DHA algal oil and ARA single-cell 
oil at the November 29–December 2, 
2011 meeting. 
AMS proposes a two year 
implementation phase before this rule 
becomes effective. AMS believes that 
the NOP’s advance disclosure of its 
intent with respect to nutrient vitamins 
and minerals, in combination with a 
proposed two year implementation 
phase, will minimize disruption to the 
organic industry. The length of time is 
calculated to provide time for the NOSB 
to conclude its recommendations on 
petitions for substances impacted by 
this rule and to complete any 
rulemaking necessitated by NOSB 
recommendations to add substances to 
the National List. AMS recognizes that 
a petition submission does not 
guarantee a favorable outcome for the 
petitioner, but the process provides 
ample opportunity for stakeholders to 
inform the NOSB and the public of the 
reasons to support a National List 
exemption. AMS does not have data to 
more accurately estimate the potential 
costs of this action on the organic infant 
formula market and seeks public 
comments to refine the estimated 
impact. 
Baby Food. The OTA 2011 Organic 
Industry Survey states that sales of 
organic baby food totaled $296 million 
in 2010. Organic baby food represents a 
small, but growing share of the baby 
food market. According to ERS data, 
sales of organic baby food accounted for 
approximately 12.2% of the 
supermarket sales of all baby food in the 
first quarter of 2009.29 The NOP has 
observed a range of organic baby food 
products in various forms, including 
canned, dry and frozen and has 
observed the addition of DHA algal oil, 
choline bitartrate and unidentified 
sources of DHA and ARA to a few 
organic baby food products. Within each 
type, there are organic baby food 
products which would comply with this 
proposed action with respect to the 
addition of vitamins and minerals.30 
However, AMS does not have data to 
determine the proportion of baby food 
which would be affected by this 
proposed action and seeks comments to 
refine this estimate. 
AMS believes that the two year 
implementation phase would minimize 
any disruption to the organic baby food 
industry. During this time, the impacted 
stakeholders have the opportunity to 
submit petitions to add substances to 
the National List that would be 
excluded from use in organic products. 
The implementation period also 
provides affected entities with time to 
consider reformulating products to 
comply with the proposed action. 
Fluid Milk and Dairy Products. The 
total sales of organic milk and cream 
sales for 2010 was reported to be $2.1 
billion. 31 ERS has calculated that 2.8 
percent of the universal product codes 
(UPCs) for organic milk are codes for 
milk products which contain DHA.32 
However, due to variability in the retail 
price and sales volume for different 
types of organic milk products, the 
percentage of UPCs cannot be 
extrapolated to the percentage of sales 
that would be affected by this proposed 
action. AMS does not have data to 
quantify the percent of organic milk 
sales that are attributed to milk with 
DHA and ARA. However, even 
assuming that the $2.1 billion in sales 
could be the upper limit cost of this 
proposed action, AMS believes that this 
significantly over estimates the impact 
of this proposed rule. As indicated by 
the organic milk UPC data from ERS, the 
organic fluid milk market includes 
many products which do not contain 
added DHA. In addition, not all organic 
milk products are available in a version 
containing added DHA. AMS is aware 
that retail prices for organic milk with 
added DHA are typically higher than 
prices for organic milk without added 
DHA.33 However, we lack numerical 
data to describe the economic impact of 
DHA in the organic milk market, 
particularly in comparison to other 
growth drivers such as a narrowing gap 
between organic and nonorganic milk 
prices.34 AMS seeks public comments to

organic milk/cream category in 2010, to a narrower 
price gap between organic and nonorganic milk as 
a result of higher conventional commodity prices. 
35 Organic Trade Association, 2011. The 2011 
Organic Industry Survey reported $1.049 billion in 
sales of ‘‘dry breakfast goods’’ for 2010. 
36 ERS determined this estimate by utilizing data 
from the Gladson UPC (Universal Product Code) 
database which contains 160,000 food UPC codes 
and detailed nutritional information. The 2.8% 
estimate is based on 2010 data. See footnote 19 for 
a list of the substances included in the search 
criteria. 
37 Sundale Research, 2011. State of the Industry: 
Natural and Organic Pet Food in the U.S., 4th 
Edition, Bayshore, N.Y. 
38 The FDA considers the nutrients listed in 
Tables 15–10, 15–12 and 15–14 to be essential 
nutrients for cats where a Minimal Requirement or 
Adequate Intake value has been established in order 
for the product to be labeled, ‘‘complete and 
balanced.’’ 
39 Although taurine is not a required nutrient for 
dog food, some organic dog foods may contain 
taurine. However, AMS believes the amount of 
organic dog food products affected would be 
minimal. 
refine the estimated impact of this 
proposed action upon organic fluid milk 
and dairy products. 
AMS believes there are additional 
factors that would mitigate the projected 
$2.1 billion impact on the organic dairy 
sector. One factor is the existence of an 
alternative form of DHA, derived from 
fish oil, which is acceptable for use in 
organic milk and dairy products. 
Section 205.606 of the National List 
provides for the use of two components 
of fish oil, specifically, the omega-3 fatty 
acids, DHA and eicosapentaenoic (EPA). 
This estimated cost to the organic dairy 
sector does not include organic milk 
which contains DHA from fish oil 
because the addition of those substances 
would not be prohibited by this 
proposed action. While AMS is aware 
that DHA algal oil has a unique market 
appeal as a vegetarian source of DHA, 
there is an allowed source of omega-3 
fatty acids to enable operations affected 
by proposed action to maintain a stake 
in the niche market for omega-3 organic 
milk. 
AMS’ estimate assumes that all sales 
attributed to organic milk with DHA 
could be potentially affected in the 
organic milk sector. However, the NOP 
believes, but does not have affirmative 
data that some portion of DHA organic 
milk purchases would transfer to other 
organic milk products without algal 
DHA, mitigating the potential loss of 
organic milk sales to the organic dairy 
sector. Further, AMS expects that some 
portion of consumers is chiefly 
motivated by the perceived benefits of 
organic certification and would keep 
their purchases within the organic dairy 
sector. Such consumer behavior would 
decrease the estimated sales impact of 
this proposed action. 
In addition, AMS is proposing a two 
year implementation period. As of the 
publication of this proposed rule, 
petitions have been submitted to the 
NOSB for the addition of DHA algal oil 
and ARA single-cell oil. During the 
implementation period, affected entities 
will have the opportunity to present 
their public comments to the NOSB 
regarding DHA algal oil and ARA single- 
cell oil. If the NOSB approves a 
recommendation to add these 
substances to the National List, the 
length of the implementation period is 
expected to be adequate to cover the 
necessary rulemaking and minimize 
disruption to the industry. 
Breakfast Cereal. The sales for organic 
breakfast cereal totaled approximately 
$1 billion in 2010.35 ERS has calculated 
that 2.8 percent of the UPCs for organic 
breakfast cereals are codes for cereals 
which contain a substance that would 
be prohibited from use in organic 
products as a result of this proposed 
rule.36 AMS lacks data on market share 
of breakfast cereals with any of the 
identified substances (referred to 
‘‘added nutrients’’ for the remainder of 
this section). While assuming an upper 
limit of $1 billion for the estimated 
impact of this proposed action on 
organic breakfast cereal, the agency 
considers that this figure is significantly 
inflated. As evidenced by the ERS data, 
not all organic breakfast cereals contain 
an added nutrient(s) that would be 
affected by this proposed action. 
AMS’ estimate assumes that all sales 
attributed to organic breakfast cereal 
with added nutrients would potentially 
be affected in the organic breads and 
grains sector. However, the NOP 
believes, but does not have affirmative 
data, that some portion of these 
purchases would transfer to other 
organic breakfast cereals, mitigating any 
potential adverse impact. Further, AMS 
believes it is accurate to infer that some 
portion of purchases are motivated by 
perceived benefits of the organic 
certification rather than the nutrients 
added, which would decrease the 
estimated sales impact. 
In addition, the proposed two year 
implementation period is expected to be 
sufficient for NOSB consideration of 
petitions for added nutrients received as 
of publication of this rule and any 
rulemaking necessitated by NOSB 
recommendations on these petitions. As 
AMS does not have data to more 
accurately estimate the potential costs of 
this action on the organic breakfast 
cereal market, the agency is seeking 
public comments to refine the estimated 
impact. 
Pet Food. AMS estimates that the 
potential impact of this proposed action 
on the organic pet food industry to be 
$42 million. According to a Sundale 
Research report, the 2010 sales for 
organic pet food totaled $116 million, 
36 percent of which was attributed to 
sales of cat food.37 The estimated impact 
of $42 million is equivalent to the 2010 
sales of organic cat food. AMS 
anticipates that all organic cat food 
would be impacted by this proposed 
action because cat food must contain the 
substance taurine. Taurine is an organic 
acid which is essential for healthy heart 
function and prevention of blindness in 
cats. The amount of taurine must meet 
the minimal requirement as established 
for cats by the National Research 
Council’s Nutrient Requirements of Cats 
and Dogs (2006).38 The National List 
does not contain a specific exemption 
for the use of taurine, nor does the FDA 
fortification policy provide for the use 
of this substance because the policy 
does not pertain to pet foods. 
The $42 million in sales of organic cat 
food includes sales of cat treats. 
According to the Sundale Research data, 
sales of cat food treats accounted for 
12.5 percent of 2010 sales, or $5.25 
million. Pet treats, however, are exempt 
from including a nutritional adequacy 
statement and cat treats are not required 
to include taurine. Therefore, AMS 
expects that some portion of organic cat 
treats would not be affected by this 
proposed action. AMS does not have 
data on the percent of cat treats that do 
or do not contain taurine to further 
refine this estimate. Therefore, the 
estimate is based on an underlying 
assumption that all cat treats contain 
taurine.39 Because AMS does not have 
data to more accurately estimate the 
potential costs for organic pet food, the 
agency is seeking public comments to 
refine the estimated impact. 
AMS intends to address the overall 
use of nutrient vitamins and minerals in 
pet food through a separate rulemaking 
that would establish standards for 
organic pet food. A petition to add 
taurine to the National List for use in 
pet food was submitted to the NOP in 
September 2010. AMS believes that the 
NOSB review of the petition and the 
promulgation of organic pet food 
regulations will conclude within the 
implementation phase of this proposed 
action to mitigate disruption to the 
organic pet food industry. 
In summary, AMS expects that 
potential impacts on sales of organic 
products in the aforementioned 
categories could be mitigated through 
several factors. The proposed two year 
implementation period is intended to

1992 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 8 / Thursday, January 12, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
40 AMS determined that the following North 
American Industry Classification System categories, 
from among those listed in the SBA regulations, are 
relevant to the manufacturing activity that could be 
affected by this proposed rulemaking: Dry, 
condensed and evaporated dairy product 
manufacturing (organic infant formula); 
Miscellaneous food manufacturing (organic baby 
food); Fluid milk manufacturing, Breakfast cereal 
manufacturing, Dog and cat food manufacturing. 
provide time for NOSB to consider 
petitions for substances that are affected 
by this action and for AMS to conclude 
rulemaking to add substances to the 
National List. The implementation 
phase would also provide affected 
entities time to explore reformulation or 
relabeling of affected products. AMS is 
seeking comments on the length of the 
proposed compliance date. Further, 
AMS believes that if some products are 
discontinued as a result of this proposed 
rule, some consumers will purchase, as 
an alternative, an organic product 
within the same category rather than a 
nonorganic product. 
B. Executive Order 12988 
Executive Order 12988 instructs each 
executive agency to adhere to certain 
requirements in the development of new 
and revised regulations in order to avoid 
unduly burdening the court system. 
This proposed rule is not intended to 
have a retroactive effect. 
States and local jurisdictions are 
preempted under the OFPA from 
creating programs of accreditation for 
private persons or State officials who 
want to become certifying agents of 
organic farms or handling operations. A 
governing State official would have to 
apply to USDA to be accredited as a 
certifying agent, as described in section 
2115(b) of the OFPA (7 U.S.C. 6514(b)). 
States are also preempted under 
sections 2104 through 2108 of the OFPA 
(7 U.S.C. 6503 through 6507) from 
creating certification programs to certify 
organic farms or handling operations 
unless the State programs have been 
submitted to, and approved by, the 
Secretary as meeting the requirements of 
the OFPA. 
Pursuant to section 2108(b)(2) of the 
OFPA (7 U.S.C. 6507(b)(2)), a State 
organic certification program may 
contain additional requirements for the 
production and handling of organically 
produced agricultural products that are 
produced in the State and for the 
certification of organic farm and 
handling operations located within the 
State under certain circumstances. Such 
additional requirements must: (a) 
Further the purposes of the OFPA, (b) 
not be inconsistent with the OFPA, (c) 
not be discriminatory toward 
agricultural commodities organically 
produced in other States, and (d) not be 
effective until approved by the 
Secretary. 
Pursuant to section 2120(f) of the 
OFPA (7 U.S.C. 6519(f)), this proposed 
rule would not alter the authority of the 
Secretary under the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601–624), the 
Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 
U.S.C. 451–471), or the Egg Products 
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031–1056), 
concerning meat, poultry, and egg 
products, nor any of the authorities of 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services under the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301–392), 
nor the authority of the Administrator of 
EPA under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 
136–137). 
Section 2121 of the OFPA (7 U.S.C. 
6520) provides for the Secretary to 
establish an expedited administrative 
appeals procedure under which persons 
may appeal an action of the Secretary, 
the applicable governing State official, 
or a certifying agent under this title that 
adversely affects such person or is 
inconsistent with the organic 
certification program established under 
this title. The OFPA also provides that 
the U.S. District Court for the district in 
which a person is located has 
jurisdiction to review the Secretary’s 
decision. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 601–612) requires agencies to 
consider the economic impact of each 
rule on small entities and evaluate 
alternatives that would accomplish the 
objectives of the rule without unduly 
burdening small entities or erecting 
barriers that would restrict their ability 
to compete in the market. The purpose 
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of 
businesses subject to the action. Section 
605 of the RFA allows an agency to 
certify a rule, in lieu of preparing an 
analysis if the rulemaking is not 
expected to have a significant impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth 
in the RFA, AMS performed an 
economic impact analysis on small 
entities in the final rule published in the 
Federal Register on December 21, 2000 
(65 FR 80548). AMS has also considered 
the economic impact of this proposed 
action on small entities. Small entities 
include producers engaged in crop and 
animal production and handlers that 
process organic products or develop, 
market and sell organic products. AMS 
has determined that this proposed rule 
will not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
AMS notes that several requirements 
to complete the RFA overlap with the 
Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and 
the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). For 
example, the RFA requires a description 
of the reasons why action by the agency 
is being considered and an analysis of 
the proposed rule’s costs to small 
entities. The RIA describes the need for 
this proposed rule and provides an 
analysis of the benefits and costs of a 
proposed rule. Further, the RFA 
requires a description of the projected 
reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements of the proposed rule. The 
PRA provides an estimate of the 
reporting and recordkeeping 
(information collection) requirements of 
a proposed rule. In order to avoid 
duplication, we combine some analyses 
as allowed in section 605(b) of the RFA. 
The RIA also provides summary 
information on the size of the organic 
industry, production capacity and sales 
by category of organic products with a 
focus upon those products likely to be 
affected by this rulemaking. It also 
provides information on potential costs 
to handlers that have chosen to obtain 
organic certification. The RIA and PRA 
should be referred to for more detail. 
This proposed rule would affect 
handlers involved in manufacturing 
and/or marketing certain types of 
organic processed products including, 
infant formula, baby food, fluid milk, 
breakfast cereal and pet food. Organic 
handlers engage in the selling, 
processing and/or packaging of 
agricultural products. Some handlers 
have processing facilities, while others 
develop formulations and labels and 
market products, but contract with a co- 
packer for the manufacturing. For the 
purposes of this analysis, AMS 
considered co-packers and marketing 
operations to be a single handling entity 
due to the inter-dependent relationship 
for producing organic products. The 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
(13 CFR 121.201), defines small food 
manufacturers by the number of 
employees. SBA identifies various 
subsectors of the food manufacturing 
industry by the North American 
Industry Classification System 
(Subsector 311—Food Manufacturing). 
Entities which manufacture the organic 
products listed above, with the 
exception of breakfast cereal, would 
qualify as a small business if the 
number of employees does not exceed 
500. The small business threshold for 
breakfast cereal manufacturing is a 
maximum of 1,000 employees.40 
Based on USDA data, the total acreage 
of certified organic land grew from 1.8 
million acres in 2000 to 4.8 million 
acres in 2008, of which approximately 
2.2 million acres was pasture and

48 Organic Trade Association, 2011. 2011 Organic 
Industry Survey. This estimate does not include 
potential impacts to organic yogurt. The NOP 
believes such impact would be minimal as there 
appears to be very few organic yogurt products on 
the market which contain DHA algal oil or other 
substances that would not be allowed per this 
proposed action. Organic yogurt which contains 
DHA or omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil 
is available; this is acceptable for use in organic 
production currently and would continue to remain 
compliant under this proposed action. 
49 ERS determined this estimate by utilizing data 
from the Gladson UPC (Universal Product Code) 
database which contains 160,000 food UPC codes 
and detailed nutritional information. The 2.8% 
estimate is based on 2010 data. ERS searched that 
database for organic milk products containing one 
or more of the 11 nutrients specified by the NOP: 
docosaheaxaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid 
(ARA), taurine, inositol, choline, ascorbyl 
palmitate, beta-carotene, carnitine, lycopene, 
nucleotides, and lutein.

organic producers in the U.S. nearly 
doubled in that time period rising from 
approximately seven thousand in 2000 
to nearly 13,000 in 2008.42 ERS 
estimated the number of certified 
handling operations was 3,225 in 
2007.43 
Legal Basis and Objective of Proposal 
In 1990, Congress enacted the Organic 
Foods Production Act of 1990, as 
amended (OFPA) (7 U.S.C. 6501–6522). 
The OFPA requires all agricultural 
products labeled as ‘‘organically 
produced’’ to originate from farms or 
handling operations certified by a State 
or private agency that has been 
accredited by USDA. The OFPA 
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to establish a National List of approved 
and prohibited substances that meet 
criteria enumerated in the Act. The 
exemptions for the use of synthetic 
substances must be based on proposed 
amendments of the National Organic 
Standards Board. 
This proposed rule would correct the 
National List exemption for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals by replacing the 
reference to FDA’s fortification policy 
(21 CFR 104.20) with references to the 
FDA regulatory provisions that clearly 
convey what substances are permitted 
for fortification of food (21 CFR 101.9). 
This proposed action would also add 
references for the FDA regulations for 
the required vitamins and minerals for 
infant formula (21 CFR 107.100 and 
107.10) because the fortification policy 
does not address the addition of 
nutrients to infant formula. 
Applicability of Proposal 
The population that would be directly 
impacted by this proposed rule is a 
subset of certified organic handlers of 
infant formula, baby food, milk, 
breakfast cereal and pet food. While we 
do not have precise data, AMS expects 
the number of organic handlers that 
could be affected by this proposed 
action to be substantially less than the 
entire population of organic handlers 
which ERS estimated to be 3,225 in 
2007. In general, AMS has ascertained 
that the use of substances that could no 
longer be added to organic products as 
a result of this proposed action tends to 
be concentrated among certain national 
brands. AMS believes that few of these 
handlers would be considered small 
entities under the criteria established by 
the SBA, as discussed below. AMS is 
seeking comments on the adequacy of 
the estimated impact of the proposed 
action on small entities. 
Costs of Proposed Rule—Direct Costs to 
Handlers 
Infant Formula. The Organic Trade 
Association reported that sales of 
organic infant formula were $689 
million for the year 2010.44 According 
to measurements by ERS, as of the first 
quarter in 2009, 99.5 percent of organic 
infant formula contained added DHA 
and ARA.45 AMS believes that 
approximately five brands of organic 
infant formula produced by two 
manufacturers dominate the U.S. 
organic infant formula market. Organic 
infant formula sold under five of these 
brands contains ingredients, such as, 
DHA algal oil, ARA single-cell oil, 
taurine and inositol, which would not 
be permitted by this proposed action. 
AMS is confident that two of these 
entities would not be considered a small 
business under the SBA criteria. 
Baby Food. The Organic Trade 
Association disclosed that sales of 
organic baby food totaled $296 million 
in 2010.46 According to ERS data, sales 
of organic baby food accounted for 
approximately 12.2 percent of the 
supermarket sales of all baby food in the 
first quarter of 2009.47 The baby food 
category includes products in a variety 
of forms and ingredients for different 
age groups ranging from cereals, pureed 
fruits, vegetables, grains and proteins, 
snacks and yogurt. According to the 
database of NOP certified operations, 
the number of U.S. operations handling 
organic baby food is less than 20. 
AMS has observed DHA algal oil, 
choline bitartrate and unidentified 
sources of DHA and ARA as ingredients 
in a few organic baby food products. 
These ingredients would not be 
permitted in organic formula by this 
proposed action unless and until there 
are specific exemptions on the National 
List for these substances. In general, 
however, prevalent use of substances 
that would be prohibited as a result of 
this proposed action in organic baby 
food has not been detected. AMS 
believes that approximately three 
entities, which distribute products 
nationally, would be impacted by this 
proposed rule. AMS is confident that 
one of these entities would not meet the 
criteria for a small business. Based upon 
the extent of the distribution of products 
and the marketing channels, AMS is 
uncertain whether either of the two 
other entities would qualify as a small 
business. The products that would be 
affected by this proposed rule, however, 
represent only a portion of the organic 
baby food offerings of these entities. 
Therefore, AMS believes the impact of 
this rule, if any, on small entities in the 
organic baby food category would be 
negligible. AMS welcomes comments to 
further inform its determination. 
Fluid Milk. The total sales of organic 
milk and cream for the year 2010 were 
reported to be $2.1 billion.48 ERS has 
calculated that 2.8 percent of the 
universal product codes for organic milk 
are codes for milk products which 
contain DHA.49 According to ERS, as of 
May 2007, two suppliers were providing 
about 75 percent of the nationally 
branded organic milk.50 That balance 
has likely shifted due to the growth in 
private label brands, many of which are 
supplied by one organic milk handler. 
Based on ERS analysis, AMS believes 
that three organic dairy handlers supply 
most of the organic milk in the U.S. 
market (two supplying national brands 
and one supplying various private label 
milk). AMS is aware of other organic 
dairy handlers which distribute on a 
smaller scale and that the dairy handlers 
may collect milk from hundreds of 
organic producers. 
One of the national organic milk 
brands offers several organic milk 
varieties with added DHA algal oil.

There is at least one other organic milk 
brand which contains DHA algal oil, but 
which is not distributed on a national 
scale. Both of these entities would be 
impacted by the proposed action 
because DHA algal oil would not be 
allowed in organic milk unless and until 
there is a specific exemption on the 
National List for this substance. AMS 
believes that one of these companies, 
which is part of a multinational 
corporation, would not qualify as a 
small business as defined by the SBA 
for fluid milk manufacturing. AMS 
expects that this action could impact 
some small milk handlers which offer 
organic milk with DHA algal oil. 
However, the Agency concludes that 
this proposed action would not have a 
significant impact on these entities as 
organic milk brands have diversified 
organic dairy offerings and do not 
produce or market organic milk with 
DHA exclusively. The diversification in 
the product line could help to offset any 
costs impacts of reformulating or 
discontinuing some products within a 
brand. Furthermore, there are 
alternative sources of DHA from fish oil, 
which are allowed as ingredients in 
organic products per section § 205.606 
of the National List, and would be 
available to organic handlers that want 
to remain in or enter the DHA/omega- 
3 organic milk market niche. 
Breakfast cereal. The sales for organic 
breakfast cereal totaled approximately 
$1 billion in 2010.51 ERS has calculated 
that 2.8 percent of the universal product 
codes for organic breakfast cereals are 
codes for cereals which contain a 
substance that would be prohibited from 
use in organic products as a result of 
this proposed rule.52 AMS has not 
identified which organic cereals, other 
than those marketed for babies, contain 
substances which would be prohibited 
from use in organic products as a result 
of this proposed action. The projected 
impacts to organic baby food are 
described above and in the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis. AMS believes that this 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small breakfast cereal 
manufacturers for several reasons. Due 
to the numerous varieties of organic 
breakfast cereal on the market, the 
estimated 2.8 percent of universal 
product codes which would be 
impacted by this proposed action 
represents few products. Organic cereal 
brands typically offer a variety of 
cereals, improving the likelihood that 
not all formulations would be adversely 
affected by this proposed action. AMS 
welcomes comments to further inform 
our consideration of the impacts of this 
proposed rule upon the organic 
breakfast cereal market. 
Pet Food. According to a report by 
Sundale Research, the 2010 sales for 
organic pet food totaled $116 million, 
growing approximately 18 percent over 
the previous year. AMS believes that 
this action would adversely impact 
organic cat food, which accounts for 36 
percent of the organic pet food market.53 
Organic cat food must contain the 
substance taurine, an organic acid 
which is essential for healthy heart 
function and prevention of blindness in 
cats. The amount of taurine must meet 
the minimal requirement as established 
for cats by the National Research 
Council’s Nutrient Requirements of Cats 
and Dogs (2006). The National List does 
not contain a specific exemption for the 
use of taurine, nor does the FDA 
fortification policy provide for the use 
of this substance because the policy 
does not pertain to pet foods. 
AMS has observed that pet food 
companies which market organic pet 
foods also offer natural pet food 
products. AMS is not aware of any pet 
food companies that exclusively 
manufacture organic pet foods and 
believes that the product and market 
diversification within individual 
entities to include pet treats, organic 
dog food and natural pet foods, 
respectively, provides insulation from 
the impacts of this proposed action. 
Furthermore, AMS intends to address 
the use of nutrient vitamins and 
minerals in pet food through a separate 
rulemaking that would establish 
standards for organic pet food. A 
petition to add taurine to the National 
List for use in pet food was submitted 
to the NOP in September 2010. AMS 
believes that the NOSB review of any 
petitions and the promulgation of 
organic pet food regulations will 
conclude within the implementation 
phase of this proposed action to mitigate 
disruption to the organic pet food 
industry. 
Indirect Costs to Organic Producers 
OTA’s April 2011 White Paper on the 
Fortification of Organic Foods includes 
an estimate of the sales of organic 
commodities used as ingredients in 
fortified organic products, which could 
potentially be impacted by regulatory 
action to restrict substances used for 
supplementation in foodstuffs.54 OTA 
calculated the estimated farm gate sales 
as $11 million dollars based on a ratio 
of 1:4:8, for the variables, farm-gate 
sales, retail sales and total size of the 
industry, respectively. The OTA White 
Paper also identifies the range of 
commodities which supply impacted 
organic categories. The organic 
commodity supply stream includes 
meats and poultry, grains, tree fruit, 
vegetables, nuts, fluid milk and milk 
powder, and soy. 
Small agricultural producers are 
defined by the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) (12 CFR 121.201) 
as those having receipts of less than 
$750,000. The majority of organic 
ingredient producers whose agricultural 
products are diverted to organic infant 
formula, baby food, milk, breakfast 
cereal and pet food would likely qualify 
as small agricultural producers. While 
we do not have precise data, AMS 
expects the number of producers of 
organic ingredients that could be 
affected by this proposed action to be 
substantially less than the entire 
population of organic producers which 
ERS estimated to be nearly 13,000 in 
2008. This proposed rule is not 
expected to have an impact on a 
substantial number of small agricultural 
producers. According to ERS, the 
demand for organic products has 
historically exceeded the supply of 
organic ingredients. In 2004, ERS 
conducted a survey of organic handlers 
and found that 13% experienced critical 
shortages for one of their organic 
products and concluded that 38% were 
importing raw, organic materials 
produced outside the U.S.55 That 
discrepancy persists according to the 
OTA ‘‘2011 Organic Industry Survey’’ 
which reported difficulty, ranging from 
major to occasional, with the supply of 
organic raw materials. This report also 
indicated that 62 percent of companies 
surveyed in 2010 intended to increase 
their use of organic ingredients over the 
next three years. Given the projections 
for continued expansion of the organic 
sector, AMS expects that there will be 
opportunities for producers to divert 
organic agricultural products to other 
purchasers to buffer the impact of any 
disruption to the manufacture of certain

processed organic products as a result of 
this proposed action. 
Organic meat and poultry producers 
that supply the organic pet food 
industry, however, could face more 
formidable challenges. The organic pet 
food market facilitates carcass 
utilization for organic meat and poultry 
parts which do not enter human food 
chain. Poultry producers, in particular, 
would be prone to experience a greater 
impact because chicken comprises most 
of the protein in organic pet food. AMS 
does not know the number of organic 
poultry producers that supply the 
organic pet food sector. 
Conclusion 
This proposed rule would correct the 
National List exemption for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals by replacing the 
reference to FDA’s fortification policy 
(21 CFR 104.20) with references to the 
FDA regulatory provisions that clearly 
convey what substances are permitted 
for fortification of food (21 CFR 101.9). 
This proposed action would also add 
references for the FDA regulations for 
the required vitamins and minerals for 
infant formula (21 CFR 107.100 and 
107.10) because the fortification policy 
does not address the addition of 
nutrients to infant formula. Overall, this 
proposed action would narrow the 
number of potential substances for 
addition to organic foods in comparison 
of NOP’s current interpretation of the 
exemption for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals. This proposed rule would 
establish a finite list of essential and 
required vitamins and minerals for food 
and infant formula. Sustained consumer 
demand is essential to the economic 
stability of organic producers and 
handlers, and this proposed action 
would bridge consumer expectations 
and the innovation of organic 
operations. 
The proposed revisions to the 
exemption for nutrient vitamins and 
minerals could entail costs for certified 
operations which are manufacturing 
and/or marketing organic products that 
contain substances which fall outside 
the revised parameters for nutrient 
vitamins and minerals. The costs 
associated with this proposed rule could 
include reformulating products to 
remove nonagricultural ingredients that 
are clearly prohibited by the National 
List and relabeling products to reflect 
formulation changes. The types of 
substances that would be restricted by 
this proposed action are nutrients which 
are not added to have a functional effect 
on the product, but for nutrient content 
and may be associated with a nutritional 
claim. Therefore, the removal of these 
ingredients from product formulations 
is not expected to necessitate 
procurement of substitute ingredients. 
Due to the diversity of products and 
ingredients that may be affected by this 
rule, AMS is not attempting to quantify 
the range of possible of reformulation 
and relabeling to individual operations. 
AMS believes that this proposed rule 
would facilitate increased consumer 
confidence in organic products. This 
proposed action would clearly delineate 
the requirements for adding vitamins 
and minerals to organic foods and infant 
formula, and foster the consistent 
implementation and enforcement of 
these requirements. Furthermore, this 
proposed action does not preclude the 
potential for substances excluded from 
use to be considered for future use in 
organic products, but it would require 
that use be predicated upon the review 
and recommendation of the NOSB. That 
process will ultimately bolster the 
certainty of organic handlers about the 
regulatory status of ingredients, deter 
consumer skepticism and improve the 
competitiveness of the market for 
organic foods. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
No additional collection or 
recordkeeping requirements are 
imposed on the public by this proposed 
rule. Accordingly, OMB clearance is not 
required by section 350(h) of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 
U.S.C. 3501, Chapter 35, or OMB’s 
implementing regulation at 5 CFR part 
1320. 
AMS is committed to complying with 
the E-Government Act to promote the 
use of the Internet and other 
information technologies to provide 
increased opportunities for citizen 
access to Government information and 
services, and for other purposes. 
E. Civil Rights Impact Analysis 
AMS has reviewed this proposed rule 
in accordance with the Department 
Regulation 4300–4, Civil Rights Impact 
Analysis (CRIA), to address any major 
civil rights impacts the rule might have 
on minorities, women, and persons with 
disabilities. After a careful review of the 
rule’s intent and provisions, AMS has 
determined that this rule would only 
impact the organic practices of handlers 
and that this rule has no potential for 
affecting handlers in protected groups 
differently than the general population 
of handlers. This rulemaking was 
initiated to clarify a regulatory 
requirement and enable consistent 
implementation and enforcement. 
Protected individuals have the same 
opportunity to participate in the NOP as 
non-protected individuals. The NOP 
regulations prohibit discrimination by 
certifying agents. Specifically, 
§ 205.501(d) of the current regulations 
for accreditation of certifying agents 
provides that ‘‘No private or 
governmental entity accredited as a 
certifying agent under this subpart shall 
exclude from participation in or deny 
the benefits of the NOP to any person 
due to discrimination because of race, 
color, national origin, gender, religion, 
age, disability, political beliefs, sexual 
orientation, or marital or family status.’’ 
Paragraph 205.501(a)(2) requires 
‘‘certifying agents to demonstrate the 
ability to fully comply with the 
requirements for accreditation set forth 
in this subpart’’ including the 
prohibition on discrimination. The 
granting of accreditation to certifying 
agents under § 205.506 requires the 
review of information submitted by the 
certifying agent and an on-site review of 
the certifying agent’s operation. Further, 
if certification is denied, § 205.405(d) 
requires that the certifying agent notify 
the applicant of their right to file an 
appeal to the AMS Administrator in 
accordance with § 205.681. These 
regulations provide protections against 
discrimination, thereby permitting all 
handlers, regardless of race, color, 
national origin, gender, religion, age, 
disability, political beliefs, sexual 
orientation, or marital or family status, 
who voluntarily choose to adhere to the 
proposed rule and qualify, to be 
certified as meeting NOP requirements 
by an accredited certifying agent. This 
proposed rule in no way changes any of 
these protections against discrimination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Organic Foods Production Act of 
1990 (OFPA), 7 U.S.C. 6501–6522, 
authorizes the establishment of the 
National List. The National List 
identifies synthetic substances that are 
exempted (allowed) in organic 
production and nonsynthetic substances 
that are prohibited in organic crop and 
livestock production. The National List 
also identifies nonagricultural 
nonsynthetic, nonagricultural synthetic 
and nonorganic agricultural substances 
that may be used in organic handling. 
The exemptions and prohibitions 
granted under the OFPA are required to 
be reviewed every 5 years by the 
National Organic Standards Board 
(NOSB). The Secretary of Agriculture 
has authority under the OFPA to renew 
such exemptions and prohibitions. If the 
substances are not reviewed by the 
NOSB within 5 years of their inclusion 
on the National List and addressed by 
the Secretary, then their authorized use 
or prohibition expires under OFPA’s 
sunset provision. 
In response to the sunset provisions 
in the OFPA, the Secretary published an 
Advanced Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANPR) in the Federal 
Register on March 26, 2010 (75 FR 
14500), announcing the review of 
exempted and prohibited substances 
codified at the National List of the 
National Organic Program (NOP) 
regulations and set to expire in 2012. A 
list of these substances is provided as 
Table 1 in the Overview of Proposed 
Actions section.1 The ANPR explained 
that, unless reviewed and recommended 
by the NOSB, a synthetic substance 
exempted for use on the National List in 
2007 and currently allowed for use in 
organic production would no longer be 
allowed for use after its respective 
sunset date in 2012; a nonsynthetic 
substance prohibited from use on the 
National List in 2007 and currently 
prohibited from use in organic 
production would be allowed after its 
respective sunset date in 2012; and a 
synthetic or nonsynthetic substance 
exempted for use on the National List in 
2007 and currently allowed for use in 
organic handling would be prohibited 
after its respective sunset date in 2012. 
The ANPR announced the upcoming 
review of these substances by the NOSB 
and the NOP’s intent to complete the 
sunset process based upon 
recommendations by the NOSB for all 
listings added to the National List in 
2007. The ANPR notified the public that 
this rulemaking would be completed by 
the earliest respective sunset date, June 
27, 2012. The ANPR also requested 
public comment on the continued use or 
prohibition of these substances. The 
public comment period lasted 60 days. 
The NOP received approximately 100 
comments in response to the ANPR. 
Comments were received from 
consumers, organic crop producers, 
academia, accredited certifying agents, 
trade associations, retailers and organic
