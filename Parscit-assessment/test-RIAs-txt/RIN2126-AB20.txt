EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) or regulatory evaluation provides an assessment 
of the costs and benefits of requiring motor carriers to use electronic on-board recorders 
(EOBRs) to track driving and duty time. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA or the Agency) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) that this RIA accompanies to improve compliance with the Hours of Service 
(HOS) regulations for (49 CFR Part 395) commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. 
EOBRs track driving time and other activities electronically, providing largely the same 
information currently collected on paper records of duty status (RODS). 
A Final Rule on EOBRs for HOS compliance (EOBR I) was published on April 5, 2010, 
75 FR 17207,1 providing the technical requirements for EOBRs and mandating their 
installation and use for a period of two years on all power units of carriers with recurrent 
HOS compliance problems, those found in a compliance review to have a 10 percent or 
greater violation rate (pattern violation) for any regulation in Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 
385 ("IXlO Remedial Directive Carriers,,).2 FMCSA determined that an approach 
designed to target only HOS violators would (1) be most likely to improve the safety of 
the motoring public on the highways in the near term, and (2) effectively utilize motor 
carrier and Federal and State enforcement resources. 
FMCSA proposes to expand the requirement for EOBR use to a larger number of motor 
carriers and to require these devices to be permanently installed and utilized for tracking 
of drivers' HOS. This RIA examines three options for the broader EOBR mandate that 
differ solely on the number of carriers, drivers, and power units affected. Whereas the 
lXlO Remedial Directive targeted a relatively small number of carriers, approximately 
5,700 firms with 139,000 CMVs, this second EOBR rule could potentially affect the 
entire motor carrier industry subject to the HOS rules, about 500,000 carriers with 4 
million CMV s. The Agency proposes to implement the rule three years after the

publication of a final rule; this accounts for the time needed for EOBR vendors to 
produce adequate numbers of the devices. 
The Agency gathered cost information from publicly available marketing materials and 
contact with EOBR vendors. The analysis for EOBR I focused on the least expensive 
device determined to be compliant with the rule.3 The Agency has chosen to base its 
calculations on a higher cost device in this RIA. The manufacturer of the devices used as 
the basis for the EOBR I is relatively small, and, although the Agency believed that a 
sufficient number of units for lxlO remedial directive carriers would be available at this 
price from this vendor or its competitors, it did not find evidence indicating that a 
sufficient number of-the Agency estimates that about 2 million will be needed-these 
least cost units are available for a broad industry mandate. The Agency also has not 
found any compelling evidence or economic arguments that market forces would cause 
EOBR device prices to fall. The performance standards for EOBRs require manufacturers 
to use mature, off-the-shelf technology currently implemented in fleet management 
systems (FMS) already sold in a large, competitive market. EOBR functionality will 
likely be added to these devices. The Agency is receptive to comments on its analysis of 
the EOBR and FMS market. 
FMCSA uses a higher cost device such as the one discussed in Appendix B (Alternative 
Estimates of EOBR Device Costs) of the EOBR I RIA.4 Although the manufacturer 
produces more expensive devices than the one evaluated in the EOBR I RIA, the higher 
costs of its products reflects additional functions and features unrelated to the EOBR 
HOS tracking feature. The Agency believes the unit considered in this analysis 
represents a reasonable upper limit for costs. After amortizing purchase and repair costs 
over time and evaluating monthly operational costs, the per-unit device costs would be 
slightly higher than those presented in the EOBR I RIA, but the Agency still believes that 
these costs are not overly burdensome to motor carriers. The Agency has found the range 
3 The least expensive device that satisfies the requirements of the proposed rule was found to be the 
RouteTracker sold by Turnpike Global, now part of Xata Corporation. Cost data are based on the use of 
this device with the Sprint network. See the EOBR I RIA for a complete discussion of costs of this device.

of device costs to be narrow: Annualized costs for the low cost device were estimated to 
be $525, and annualized costs for the high cost device were estimated to be $785. -
Appendix F of this RIA contains a more detailed discussion of EOBR device costs. 
Moreover, EOBRs would eliminate or significantly simplify several of the paperwork 
processes associated with paper RODS, and the monetized paperwork burden reduction 
offsets most of the device costs for motor carriers and their drivers currently using paper 
RODS. Appendix F of this RIA contains additional discussion of the availability and 
prices of EOBRs. 
This analysis also evaluates the costs and benefits of motor carriers' improved 
compliance with the underlying HOS rules through the use of EOBRs. The Agency has 
updated its assessment of the baseline level of non-compliance with the HOS rules to 
account for changes in factors such as inflation, a decline in HOS violations that preceded 
the mandate for EOBR use, and the decline in CMV -related crashes. Included in this 
analysis as alternative baselines are options from the recently published NPRM for the 
HOS rules for property carriers. (Option 1 of the HOS NPRM is to retain the current 
HOS rules) [75 FR 82170 (Dec.29, 2010)]). The major changes for both HOS options is 
to allow at most 13 hours of on-duty time within the daily driving window; limit 
continuous on-duty drive time to seven hours, at which point a thirty-minute off-duty or 
sleeper-berth period would be required; and to require at least two overnight periods per 
34-hour restart. HOS Option 2, however, also reduces daily drive time from 11 to 10 
hours, while HOS Option 3 retains 11 hours of drive time. To avoid confusion between 
the HOS options and the options for the EOBR NPRM, HOS Option 2 and HOS Option 3 
are referred to as Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. 
As stated, the Agency is currently considering three options for the EOBR mandate. 
Option 1 would be to require EOBRs for all drivers currently using paper RODS. Option 
2 (often referred to as "RODS+" in this RIA) expands Option 1 to include nearly all 
passenger-carrying CMV s and all shipments of bulk quantities of hazardous materials, 
regardless of whether the drivers use paper RODS or are exempted from doing so as 
described under the "short-haul operations" provisions in 49 CFR 395.1(e). The Agency 
iv 
believes that the higher potential for injuries and fatalities in crashes involving passenger-
carrying CMV s and shipments of bulk hazardous materials could warrant additional 
safety requirements for these operations. Option 3 would include all CMV operations 
subject to HaS requirements. 
The NPRM being evaluated also proposes changes to the HaS supporting document 
requirements. The Agency has attempted to clarify its supporting document 
requirements, recognizing that EOBR records serve as the most robust form of 
documentation for on-duty driving periods. FMCSA neither increases nor decreases the 
burden associated with Supporting Documents for HaS Compliance. These proposed 
changes are expected to improve the quality and usefulness of the supporting documents 
retained. The improved quality of the supporting documents will subsequently increase 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency's review of motor carriers' HaS records 
during on-site compliance reviews, thereby increasing its ability to detect HaS rules 
violations. The Agency is currently unable to evaluate the extent to which the proposed 
changes to the supporting documents requirements will lead to reductions in crashes.

seven percent and three percent discount rates.

IX Baseline 3 Net 859 798 478 891 831 517 Benefits 
FMCSA has estimated that all options presented in this RIA have positive net benefits 
under any baseline, that is, under any version of the HOS rules. However, the greatest 
safety impacts of the HOS rules are seen in long-haul (LH) operations, and the inclusion 
of short-haul (SH) operations diminishes the net benefits of this EOBR rule, although SH 
RODS users would experience sizable paper work savings that boost the net benefits of 
the rule.5 Therefore Option 3, which includes all carrier operations, results in much 
lower net benefits as compared to Options 1 and 2. The alternative baselines reflect 
changes to the HOS rules that affect only LH, RODS-using operations. 
5 The distinction between SH and LH operations is an important analytical concept for evaluating HOS 
rules and EOBRs, However, operationally, it is extremely difficult for enforcement personnel to 
differentiate between drivers and CMVs by length of haul. Consequently, the Agency does not believe a 
LH only option would be practical.

1 Background 
1.1 Agency Mission 
Transportation safety is the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) top strategic priority. 
Because the human toll and economic cost of transportation accidents are substantial, improving 
transportation safety is an important objective of all DOT modes. Within DOT, FMCSA is 
primarily focused on safe use of public roadways by motor carriers with the goal of reducing 
crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses. The Secretary of Transportation 
has promulgated the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to further this 
purpose. In carrying out its safety mandate, FMCSA develops and enforces regulations that 
balance motor carrier safety with industry efficiency.6 
The goal of the HOS regulations (49 CFR Part 395) is to promote safe driving of commercial 
motor vehicles by limiting on-duty and driving time and ensuring that drivers have adequate time 
to obtain rest. FMCSA conducts regular checks at the roadside and during compliance reviews to 
ensure that drivers are operating within the HOS limits. Surveys have shown, however, that 
many CMV drivers violate HOS limits, and that many also falsify their paper RODS to give the 
appearance of legal operation.7,8 A recent online survey, conducted by United Safety Alliance, 
Inc., revealed that over 78% of its respondents believe that the most common, deliberate HOS 
violation is log-time as being off-duty when actually on-duty. The survey also discovered that 
"77% of the respondents admitted to deliberately violating the HOS regulations in the past and 
55% said they were still currently deliberately violating the rules." Furthermore, survey 
respondents were asked to estimate how many days per month that they were in violation. 
Respondents admitted to intentionally violating HOS regulations 6 days per month, and 
unintentionally at least 5 days per month, either by accident, oversight, or honest mistake.9 The

National Transportation Safety Board and safety advocacy groups have recommended mandatory 
use of EOBRs as a way to increase compliance with HOS regulations. 
1.2 Description of Proposed Rule 
This RIA provides an assessment of the costs and benefits of requiring motor carriers to use 
EOBRs to track driving, on-duty, off-duty, and sleeper berth time. This requirement would be set 
primarily to improve compliance with the HOS limits on CMV drivers. EOBRs track driving 
time and other activities electronically, providing similar information to the currently used paper 
RODS. However, use of EOBR technology would significantly reduce or eliminate false or 
erroneous driving time records, and could reduce false and erroneous on-duty, off-duty, and 
sleeper-berth entries. The Agency published a Final Rule on EOBRs (EOBR I) on April 5, 2010, 
specifying their technical requirements and mandating their installation and use for a period of 
two years on all power units of carriers with recurrent HOS compliance problems, those found in 
a compliance review to have a 10 percent or greater violation rate (pattern violation) for any 
regulation in Appendix C to 49 CFR part 385 ("1XlO Remedial Directive Carriers"). The 
effective date of this Final Rule is June 4, 2012. A full RIA assessing the costs and benefits of 
EOBRs was prepared for EOBR I, but the analysis of EOBR benefits and costs has been updated 
to more precisely evaluate the impacts of these devices when they are required for a majority of 
or all CMV operations. The Agency has also published an NPRM on the HOS rules, and this 
RIA also evaluates EOBRs against two of the proposals in that NPRM. 
The Agency has yet to identify any device that functions solely as an EOBR. Rather, electronic 
HOS recording is a simple extension of many fleet management systems (FMS) which offer 
mobile communications and tracking and are integrally synchronized with the CMV, the two 
most critical hardware requirements for the EOBRs. Carriers required to acquire and use EOBRs 
will most likely obtain new FMS that offer EOBR functionality. As it did in EOBR I, the 
Agency will continue to recognize that carriers that already have in place FMS will have a low or 
no cost alternative to acquiring EOBR functionality. These carriers will simply begin using their 
devices' EOBR feature or to upgrade their devices to this functionality.

1.3 Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) 
FMCSA has determined that this rulemaking is a significant regulatory action under Executive 
Order 12866,10 Regulatory Planning and Review, and significant under Department of 
Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because the economic costs and benefits of the 
rule exceed the $100 million annual threshold and because of the substantial Congressional and 
public interest concerning the crash risks associated with driver fatigue. 
1.4 Policy Options Considered 
FMCSA is proposing to extend the mandate for EOBRs to permanent installation and use of 
these devices for the majority of motor carrier operations. However, the costs and benefits of 
such a broad mandate are not identical across all types of options. The options the Agency has 
chosen to evaluate reflect public comments the Agency received in past EOBR and HOS 
rulemakings, recommendations from other Government entities, and the Agency's safety 
priorities. 
The Agency is currently considering three options regarding the scope of the EOBR mandate. 
Option 1 would require EOBRs for all drivers required to use paper RODS. Option 2 expands 
Option 1 to include nearly all passenger carrying CMVs and all shipments of bulk quantities of 
hazardous materials (bulk HM), regardless of whether the drivers use paper RODS or are 
exempted from doing so as described under the "Short-haul operations" provisions in 49 CFR 
395.1(e). The Agency believes that the higher potential for injuries and fatalities in crashes 
involving passenger-carrying CMVs and shipments of bulk hazardous materials warrant 
additional safety requirements for these operations. Option 3 is the broadest in scope within the 
Agency's legal authority, and would include all CMV operations subject to the HOS 
requirements. 
The Agency did not consider an alternative for proposing mandatory use of EOBRs only for LH 
operations in the current NPRM. Proposing to require EOBR use for LH CMVs would present 
10 Exec. Order No. 12866, Fed. Reg. 58, No. 190 (September 30,1993): 51735-51744 
3 
difficulties for implementation because there is no current regulatory definition of "long-haul" 
and it is likely that attempts to establish a definition would cause confusion among carriers and 
enforcement officials. For example, some drivers and carriers may fall under the definition and 
be subject to the EOBR requirement on an intermittent basis making it difficult to assess the 
safety benefits for the periods where such carriers do not engage in LH operations. 
1.5 Baselines for Analysis 
The Agency considered three baselines for its analysis. The first uses the current state of 
compliance and estimated compliance costs and safety benefits from stricter enforcement of the 
current HOS rules. In constructing this baseline, the Agency began with the baseline level of 
non compliance developed for changes made to the HOS rules in 2003 11 and carefully reviewed 
and integrated all subsequent changes that have led to the current regulations. Furthermore, the 
recomputed baseline includes adjustments that reflect the decrease in HOS violations found in 
roadside inspections and the overall improvement in motor carrier safety since the 2003 HOS 
RIA was produced. Compliance costs and safety benefits were also rescaled for inflation and the 
current estimates of the monetized costs of CMV crashes. 
FMCSA evaluated costs and benefits against two alternative baselines derived from Options 2 
and 3 proposed in the HOS NPRM regarding property carriers that has been recently published 
(Option 1 of the HOS NPRM is to retain the current HOS rules)[ 75 FR 82170 (Dec 29, 2010)]). 
The major changes for both HOS options is to allow at most 13 hours of on-duty time within the 
daily driving window; limit continuous on-duty drive time to seven hours, at which point a 30-
minute off-duty or sleeper-berth period would be required; and to require at least two overnight 
periods per 34-hour restart. HOS Option 2, however, also reduces daily drive time from 11 to 10 
hours, while HOS Option 3 retains 11 hours of drive time. To avoid confusion between the HOS 
options and the options for the EOBR NPRM, HOS Option 2 and HOS Option 3 are referred to 
as Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. 
11 The 2003 and subsequent HOS rule changes have applied to property carrying operations only. The Agency 
found negligible differences in its overall estimates of costs and benefits when passenger carriers were evaluated 
separately from property carriers. 
4 
The Agency also estimated EOBRs' effectiveness in reducing HOS violations and improving 
safety. EOBR data are not continuously monitored for violations, and even if they were, not all 
HOS violations would be documented. Consequently, the Agency cannot assume that EOBR use 
wi11lead to perfect compliance with the HOS regulations. Safety benefits and compliance costs 
in all three baselines are therefore reduced to reflect the limitations of the devices. 
All monetary values are in year 2008 dollars. This is the same basis as the 2010 HOS RIA, and 
facilitates comparison between the two analyses. 
1.6 Implementation of Proposed Rule 
This RIA separately considers several categories of motor carrier operations. Short-haul (SH) 
operations for vehicles are defined as those that occur within 150 air-miles of their base, and LH 
operations for vehicles are defined as those that occur outside of the 150 air-mile radius. SH 
drivers are generally not required to keep RODS if they work fewer than 12 hours a day, start 
and stop at the same location, and operate within a 100-air mile radius (under the provisions of 
49 CFR 395.1(e)(1)) or operate certain vehicles within a 150-air mile radius (under the 
provisions of 49 CFR 395. 1(e)(2)). 12 The Agency estimates that 25 percent of SH operations are 
exempt from RODS requirements. 13 
The SH and LH group together is the entire regulated freight and passenger transporting 
population subject to HOS regulations. Because of their higher potential for fatalities and 
injuries, FMCSA examined passenger carrying and bulk hazmat operations. Last, the Agency 
divided carriers into three size groups, large (greater than 1,000 CMVs), medium (151 to 1,000 
CMVs), and small (150 CMVs or fewer). The Agency found that the percentages of operations 
in LH and SH differ across these size categories. 
The Agency proposes full implementation to occur three years after the rule is published to allow 
12 These SH drivers are allowed to substitute time-cards for RODS. 
13 See the currently approved supporting statement for the HOS Information Collection Request (lCR) (OMB 
control number 2126-000 1). The ICR estimates that 35 percent of interstate and intrastate drivers (assuming States 
adopt compatible HOS provisions for intrastate drivers) would be exempt from RODS requirements. The Agency 
assumes that a lower percentage, 25 percent of the interstate-only population of drivers, would be exempt from 
RODS. 
5 
for sufficient availability of EOBRs. This rule would likely become effective no earlier than 
2014, four years after the technical specifications were published in EOBR I, and two years after 
the first 1xlO remedial directive carriers will have been required to use the devices. Moreover, a 
significant number of motor carriers have already adopted automatic on-board recording devices 
(AOBRDs) for HOS recording and monitoring, therefore would likely adopt EOBRs when units 
meeting the technical requirements become available. Nevertheless, the Agency is uncertain 
whether motor carriers and EOBR device manufacturers will be prepared for a mandate as broad 
as those being proposed in this NPRM even by 2014, and has requested comments on this topic 
in the NPRM. 
2 Overview of Motor Carrier Industry 
2.1 Regulated Motor Carriers 
FMCSA estimates that approximately 500,000 motor carriers with 4,000,000 drivers and 
3,637,000 CMVs are currently subject to the HOS rules. Roughly 60 percent of the industry is 
engaged in SH operations and 40 percent in LH operations, although these percentages vary with 
different segments of the industry. Table 1 below summarizes the number of affected carriers, 
drivers, and CMVs in total and for the individual segments analyzed. The explanation of how 
these numbers were derived can be found in Appendix A.

6 
The magnitude of costs and benefits of this proposed rule is determined by the number of drivers 
and CMV s covered by the mandate. However, the effects of different sources of costs and 
benefits are not uniform for all drivers and CMVs. For example, the safety benefits of the HOS 
rules are highest for LH drivers, those most at risk to suffer from inadequate rest because of 
longer continuous daily driving periods and nights spent away from home, and, for team drivers, 
sleeping in a CMV in motion. For these reasons, LH carriers are the most likely to already be 
using EOBRs or FMS to efficiently route their drivers or to track their whereabouts. A full 
EOBR mandate can likely be accomplished more rapidly and at lower costs for LH operations. 
SH operations accrue smaller safety benefits from the HOS rules, and those SH carriers exempt 
from paper RODS requirements likely have no voluntary EOBR use and would not benefit from 
the elimination of paper RODS afforded by EOBRs. 
2.2 Current AOBRDIEOBR and FMS Use 
Many carriers already use AOBRDs and FMS, and will likely voluntarily adopt EOBRs when 
units meeting the technical requirements are available. As it did in EOBR I, the Agency 
excludes any voluntary use of AOBRDs and EOBRs from its analysis. Although one might 
believe that the pace of voluntary adoption would increase with the release of the EOBR 
technical requirements, the Agency notes that the requirements for AOBRDs have been in the 
FMCSRs since 1988 and, although some sectors of the motor carrier industry (specifically, many 
private motor carriers of property14) use AOBRDs extensively, the estimated adoption rate by 
motor carriers overall is only approximately 12 percent for LH operations and 4 percent for SH. 
The Agency therefore believes that without an EOBR mandate, its actions have had little effect 
on voluntary EOBR adoption and that it is most appropriate to evaluate benefits and costs with 
respect to mandated, rather than voluntary, use of these devices. 
The Agency's perception is that carriers that voluntarily adopt new technologies has been that 
these carriers are generally larger, more efficient, and safer than average. In other words, 
14 Leavitt, Wendy. "HaS and electronic logs: fleets hold lead." FleetOwner Oct. 28, 2009.

7 
carriers would not have voluntarily adopted EOBRs to address safety problems but because of a 
culture of safety consciousness that extends across many of its business decisions. Survey data 
collected by Corsi et al. 15 seem to verify this hypothesis: Their data found a negative corellation 
between current voluntary EOBR use and past SafeStat l6 scores, that is voluntary EOBR users 
had lower past scores, indicating that they were relatively safer relative to other carriers. With 
respect to this analysis of an EOBR mandate, voluntary adopters likely have better underlying 
HOS compliance records, and therefore lower net benefits of EOBR use than those carriers that 
will utilize the devices only when mandated to do so. Because the net benefits of this rule 
pertain only to these carriers that have not yet installed EOBRs, they may be understated in this 
analysis. It is important to note, however, that voluntary adopters likely accrue other benefits 
that are not necessarily part of minimal EOBR functionality, but that arise from other fleet 
management capabilities in the systems EOBRs may be bundled with. However, the EOBR 
performance specifications are such that an EOBR may be a stand-alone system that can only 
electronically monitor HOS, so these other potential productivity benefits have not been 
evaluated here. The Agency seeks data and information from current users of EOBR devices 
about any business benefits that they have observed. 
This RIA uses an updated model for forecasting voluntary use of EOBRs or AOBRDs and FMS 
without any EOBR mandate. Details on how this forecast was constructed are presented in 
Appendix B of this RIA. The Agency forecasted voluntary use only for LH operations and, 
based on data observed in 2005, assumed that voluntary use for SH operations will be one-third 
that of LH. As a consequence, while voluntary EOBR and FMS usage approaches 100 percent, 
SH voluntary use never exceeds 33 percent. This seems reasonable in light of the fact that SH 
CMV s operate close enough to their terminals such that HOS monitoring and CMV tracking is 
not problematic. Table 2 presents the forecasts of voluntary EOBR and FMS use that would 
have occurred without the EOBR mandate. Included is the percentage of carriers who would 
already be required to use EOBRs under a lxlO remedial directive; they are excluded from the 
analysis for this rule because the benefits and costs of their using EOBRs were already accounted

2.3 Total EOBRs Required 
The estimates presented in the previous two sections are used to produce estimates of the number 
of EOBRs that will need to be produced to meet the Agency's proposed mandate. A large 
portion of EOBR supply will be met by existing FMS which, as discussed in the next section, 
significantly reduces the cost of this rule. Table 3 presents the estimates of new EOBRs and 
upgradeable FMS needed for the LH and SH drivers and CMV s presented in table 2 above. 
Conversations with motorcoach companies and vendors indicate that passenger-carrying 
operations are not given attention by FMS vendors. The logistics of passenger transport, which 
generally follows predetermined schedules and routes, differ from the logistics of property 
transport, in which pickup and delivery of loads may be scheduled with little to no notice and in 
which the type of cargo, vehicle size, and weight can require more careful routing of CMV s. 
Consequently, the Agency assumes that the current use of EOBRs and FMS is insignificant in 
passenger carrying operations, and uses 0 percent in its calculations. Data in the shaded rows are 
carried forward into later stages of the analysis for the calculations of total costs and benefits.

For the calculation of paperwork savings, it is also necessary to divide the SH populations into 
those using RODS and those not using RODS. SH operations that are exempt from RODS under 
one of the SH provisions will accrue no paperwork savings from EOBR use and are unlikely to 
currently use EOBRs. Table 4 presents this subdivision. Many calculations in this table refer 
back to table 3.

3 EOBR Device Costs 
3.1 New EOBR Costs 
The Agency is basing its estimate of EOBR purchase cost on one FMS that offers electronic 
HOS monitoring and is representative of mid-2010 state-of-the-practice devices. Cost 
information was gathered from a conversation with a sales representative from this 
manufacturer. 17 Although the $1,675 purchase price of this unit is on the high end of the range 
of prices the Agency is aware of, its manufacturer has the largest share of the FMS market. 
Therefore units sold at this price are currently the most abundantly available. The manufacturer 
states that it generally covers all repairs within a three-year initial warranty period, and that it has 
been charging $300-$500 per repair outside of the warranty period. The vendor also claims that 
its devices are extremely durable and are specially tested to ensure they withstand the rigors of 
CMV operation; it states that many of its early model FMS units have been in service for more 
than a decade. Although it is unlikely that all EOBRs will remain serviceable for such long 
periods, less durable units would likely have lower purchase prices, and amortized over time, the 
purchase and repair costs of the unit considered in the analysis may equal the purchase and repair 
or replacement costs of other units. In its analysis, the Agency assumes that $500 repairs will be 
required in the fifth and tenth years of the devices' operational lives. As is the case for the 
purchase price, the Agency believes it is using a relatively high estimate for repair costs. 
Two other costs related to the device are considered in the analysis. The first is the cost of 
17 Cost information for the Qualcomm Mobile Computing Platform (MCP) 100 was acquired through 
conversation with Qualcomm sales representative, Angelo Matera, and FMCSA during a meeting on May 12,2010. 
11 
installation. The vendor of the device FMCSA is using in this analysis states that installation by 
an experienced technician would take an hour or two per unit. This RIA will use an installation 
cost of $100, which is approximately two hours of labor cost for a CMV technician. The Agency 
believes the installation of this device is relatively more complex than that of other units. For 
example, the device used for the RIA in EOBR I was simply plugged into a CMVs OBDn port, a 
procedure that took only a few seconds. The last cost is that for monthly service fees for the 
unit. The minimum service package, which covers all FMS functions and HOS monitoring, 
costs $40 per month. 
In this analysis, the Agency has assumed complete ownership, or access, to computer technology 
by motor carriers, as their use is known to be ubiquitous among all businesses. Also, this 
assumption has been adopted from EOBR I analysis, therefore, the analysis did not consider an 
estimation of the cost of purchasing new equipment (i.e., PCs). The Agency seeks public 
comments on this assumption. 
3.2 EOBR Monitoring on Current FMS 
Many FMS currently offer an HOS monitoring feature. Vendors of these devices have told the 
Agency that they are already modifying the functionality of these devices to comply with the 
technical requirements of EOBR 1. Almost all FMS currently sold offer the two most important 
hardware features necessary for EOBRs, location tracking and synchronization with the CMV 
engine, and the Agency believes that most upgrades will be relatively inexpensive software 
changes. Although HOS monitoring is often included in a single monthly fee, some 
manufacturers offer a la carte pricing for that particular feature. Two vendors contacted for 
EOBR I quoted prices of $5 or $8 per month for this additional service. IS The higher number is 
used in this RIA. 
3.3 Training Costs 
18 RouteTracker charges an additional $5 for HOS functionality and Qualcomm charges $8. Qualcomm has since 
dropped its a la carte pricing for this function, but the Agency prefers to be conservative and to use its higher price 
quote in this RIA. 
12 
In analyses conducted for EOBR I, FMCSA included the costs of training drivers, motor carrier 
office staff, and state police and other roadside inspection staff on how to use the devices and 
access electronic records, but in this RIA FMCSA has opted to exclude these costs as 
insignificant. Spread over the 140,000 CMVs affected by EOBR I, annualized training costs 
amounted to only $26 per CMV.19 Training of enforcement staff accounted for $6 of that cost, 
and because this training has to be undertaken for EOBR I, it is not a cost of this rule. Training 
costs borne by carriers were spread over two years (the period of time a carrier remains under a 
remedial directive). When the devices are installed permanently, these figures would be 
amortized over more years, further reducing the estimated cost per CMV. 
Most importantly, however, is that as the Agency has continued to talk with FMS vendors and to 
learn how these units function, it has come to believe that use of the EOBR features by drivers 
and access to the electronic RODS by carriers are largely intuitive and self-explanatory. 
Vendors have demonstrated that they have tried to make these devices as easy-to-use as possible 
for the motor carrier industry. A sales representative from the vendor of the device used in this 
analysis was able to demonstrate to FMCSA staff the EOBR features of his firm's device in just 
a few minutes. Other devices Agency staff has seen use either touch screens or simple buttons or 
keys for interacting with the device. The RouteTracker device analyzed for EOBR I used the 
driver's cell phone as its user interface. Among the tasks most drivers are already able to 
accomplish with current communications technology, such as mobile phones, computers, and 
FMS, using EOBR functions would rank as one of the simplest, and would certainly require no 
additional expertise from drivers. Also, by the time this rule becomes effective, the Agency 
believes that most drivers will have had some interaction with an FMS if not an EOBR in the 
course of their careers. The Agency is also certain that new drivers will learn to use EOBRs 
much more rapidly than to learn how to manually fill in paper RODS. Allowing for 5 minutes' 
worth of initial training per driver at a rate of $27 per hour2o yields an initial training cost of 
$2.25 per driver, and using the ratio of 1.1 drivers per CMV (or EOBR)21 yields a cost of about 
$2.50 per EOBR. Because it is a one-time cost-new drivers in the future will substitute EOBR 
training for paper RODS training already occurring-it should be amortized over the ten-year

horizon of this analysis, which yields an annualized value (using a 7 percent discount rate) of 
$0.33 per EOBR. Given that the Agency uses a relatively high EOBR cost estimate in this 
analysis, it has opted not to include this minor adjustment for training costs. 
Also, carrier office staff should be able to access and review the electronic records of their 
drivers more easily. The vendors of devices offering EOBR features that the Agency is aware of 
all offer a World Wide Web based hosting system for driver electronic RODS. Carrier staff need 
only log on to a secure web site to have access to all their drivers' records. The Agency believes 
that the tasks required of carrier office staff to view and audit the records from EOBRs are no 
more complex than those they should already be able to complete for other office work, and 
assumes that no additional training will be needed by carrier office staff. 
3.4 Annualized Estimates of EOBR Costs 
Based on the information described above and data gathered earlier for the EOBR I RIA, the 
Agency calculated annualized costs per device. These results are presented in table 5. All costs 
are discounted over 10 years and to the beginning of year 1. The analysis uses the total device 
cost of $785 per year.

4 Baseline for HOS Compliance Costs and Safety Benefits 
4.1 Overview of Analysis 
The total level of non-compliance with the HOS is extremely difficult to measure because 
violators have an incentive to hide their behavior. FMCSA does have extensive data on HOS 
violations from roadside inspections, compliance reviews, and safety audits, but, because the 
Agency cannot continually monitor every carrier and driver, this is an incomplete picture of 
HOS compliance. The last analysis to comprehensively assess total non-compliance was 
conducted for the 2003 HOS rule and resulted in estimates in costs and benefits of full 
compliance with the HOS rules relative to a "status quo," that is a real-world baseline of daily 
and weekly drive and duty times. However, data on total compliance have not been collected 
since then, but the Agency does not assume that the status-quo baseline has remained static since 
2003. Rather, it assumes that total HOS compliance has changed proportionally to changes in 
HOS violations found in roadside inspections, and additionally that the safety impacts of HOS 
non-compliance has changed proportionally to changes in overall societal damages from CMV 
crashes adjusted for revised estimates of fatigue involvement in those crashes. The following 
sections demonstrate step-by-step how the Agency updated the 2003 baseline to reflect the 
present status of compliance. 
FMCSA carefully reviewed all of its past HOS rulemaking analyses back to the 2003 rule, the 
point at which the Agency evaluated the underlying level of non-compliance with the HOS rules 
15 
prior to changes already implemented or proposed in the recently published HOS NPRM. 75 FR 
82170 (Dec 29, 2010). From that point through the current HOS NPRM, each analysis of 
changes to the HOS rules has evaluated the impacts of rule changes with respect to the fraction 
of operations affected by the changes. That is, they represent the incremental costs and benefits 
of full enforcement to changes to the rule compared to the costs and benefits of full enforcement 
of the existing rules. Consequently, starting from the 2003 status quo baseline, the costs and 
benefits of subsequent changes can be layered on to create figures representing costs and benefits 
of eliminating non-compliance with the rules currently in effect. Figures were also adjusted for 
inflation and underlying improvements in overall motor carrier safety and compliance with the 
HOS regulations. 
Because the Agency has recently published proposed revisions to the HOS rule, the Agency 
seeks comments related to the approach by which HOS is used within this rule. 
4.2 Baseline for Compliance Costs 
Compliance costs associated with the HOS rules from the perspective of a mandate for EOBR 
use represent the costs of moving the motor carrier industry from the current level of less-than-
one-hundred-percent compliance to full compliance with the current, or any set of HOS rules. 
The Agency used several steps to construct a baseline, that is, the maximum compliance costs 
EOBRs would force carriers to bear if these devices brought about perfect enforcement of the 
HOS rules, the current HOS rules and two of the proposed HOS options, as described in section 
1.5 of this RIA. Table 6 below presents the results of each level of this process. In step one (I), 
FMCSA used figures from the "Currentl100%" column of Exhibit 9-15 of the 2003 HOS RIA.22 
These figures estimated the costs of moving motor carriers to full compliance with the pre-2003 
HOS rules. Step 2 (II-III) adds the incremental changes to compliance costs from changes to the 
rules put in effect in 2003; these figures are from the "FMC SA" column of Exhibit 9-13 of the 
2003 RIA. Step 3 (IV-VI) adds the 2005 HOS rule changes-see Exhibits ES-2 and ES-5 of the

2005 RIA23-deflated24 to the same year 2000 dollars as the 2003 figures. 25 Step 4 arrives at the 
baseline for the current rules by adjusting from year 2000 to 2008 dollars (122%) and the 16 
percent decline (84% = 100% - 16%) in HOS violations discovered in roadside inspections since 
the 2003 rules went into effect. The calculation of this decline in the out of service (OOS) 
violation rate is presented in Appendix C of this RIA. The final steps simply add the incremental 
costs of the two alternative baselines derived from the 2010 HOS RIA. 
The 2003, 2005, and 2010 HOS rule baselines are taken from their respective RIAs which are 
available for public comment in the docket and summarized in Appendix H.

4.3 Baseline for Safety Benefits 
The calculations of the safety benefits follow similar steps as the compliance cost calculations. 
Table 7 below presents the results of each level of this process. Step one (I) figures are pulled 
from the "Current/100%" column of Exhibit 9-16 of the 2003 HOS RIA.26 These figures 
estimated the safety benefits of moving motor carriers to full compliance with the pre-2003 HOS 
rules. Step 2 (II-III) adds the incremental changes to safety from changes to the rules put in 
effect in 2003; these figures are from the "FMC SA" column of Exhibit 9-6 of the 2003 RIA. 
Step 3 (IV-VI) adds the 2005 HOS rule changes-see Exhibits ES-2 and ES-5 of the 2005 
RIA 27-deflated to the same year 2000 dollars as the 2003 RIA figures. 28 Step 4 arrives adjusts 
for a 203 percent increase in the average value of a CMV crash, which reflects both inflation 
from 2000 to 2008 and a higher value of statistical life (VSL), since the 2003 HOS RIA was 
produced. The calculation of this increase in the value per crash is presented in Appendix D. 
Step 5 inflates safety benefits to account for the Agency's revised estimate of fatigue related 
crashes, as discussed in the HOS NPRM RIA (see also Appendix D of this RIA) [. The Agency 
had estimated 7 percent as the percentage of CMV crashes attributable to CMV driver fatigue, 
but the 2010 HOS RIA bases its analysis on 13 percent, which results in an adjustment of 186 
percent (13%-:-7%). The final steps simply add the incremental benefits of the two alternative 
baselines presented in the HOS NPRM. Importantly, the HOS NPRM analysis calculates 
additional benefits from driver health improvements brought about by the proposed changes to

4.4 EOBR Effectiveness 
In the last few years, the Agency has entered into settlement agreements with a few carriers in 
which it waived civil penalties for violations discovered in compliance reviews in exchange for 
the carriers agreeing to install AOBRDs with enhanced functionality (such as automated 
location-tracking). The Agency examined roadside inspection and crash data to evaluate the 
19 
effectiveness of these devices at reducing violations and crashes for these carriers. Analysis of 
crash data is inconclusive. To date, relatively small carriers have entered these agreements, and 
although their crash rates may have been high, crashes were too infrequent to yield statistically 
significant measures of the safety impacts of enhanced AOBRDs. FMCSA will continue to 
monitor the data for these carriers. Roadside inspection HOS violation data, however, were 
plentiful and yielded statistically significant results. The overall out of service HOS violation 
rate fell 70 percent for these carriers, but many of the violations eliminated were those for 
missing and improper RODS, which may not mask violations to driving or on-duty time limits. 
Consequently, the Agency focused on driving and on-duty time violations, which it estimates 
EOBRs can reduce 40 percent. Therefore, in addition to baseline compliance of current HOS 
rules, the implementation of EOBR devices is estimated to eliminate 40 percent of remaining out 
of service HOS violations. Appendix E contains a more detailed description of this calculation 
and other analyses and studies the Agency considered for estimating EOBR effectiveness. 
The 2010 HOS RIA does not measure the current state of compliance with the current proposal. 
FMCSA has used the level of non-compliance with the pre-2003 rule, with some adjustments, 
including one which accounts for the current size of the carrier population affected by this rule .. 
4.5 Attainable Compliance Costs and Safety Benefits 
The baselines presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3 were adjusted to reflect the maximum efficacy of 
EOBRs. These results are presented in tables 8 and 9 below.

4.6 Compliance Costs and Safety Benefits per EOBR 
In order to complete the analysis, the Agency computes compliance costs and safety benefits per 
EOBR installed. It assumes that the benefits of EOBR use have already accrued to those 
operations currently employing AOBRDs or EOBRs, 12% of LH operations and 4% of SH 
operations (the year 2009 row of table 2). EOBRs are installed on individual CMVs and, as 
indicated in table 1, there are currently 1,472,000 LH CMVs and 2,165,000 SH CMVs. The 
number of LH CMVs without AOBRDs or EOBRs is 1,295,000 ((1-0.12)x1,472,000) and the 
number of SH CMVs without AOBRDs or EOBRs is 2,078,000 (((1-0.04)x2,165,000), for a 
total of 3,374,000 CMVs without the devices. The attainable compliance costs and safety 
benefits per EOBR are calculated by dividing the values in tables 8 and 9 by the number of 
CMVs without AOBRDs or EOBRs. An adjustment was made to the LH figures to account for 
the fact that the 1,295,000 CMVs that currently do not have EOBRs contain CMVs of 1XlO 
carriers, those with the worst HOS compliance records that are covered under EOBR1, which 
will not be effective until 2012. The compliance costs and safety benefits of those remaining 
CMVs will be slightly lower than the current state of the industry after the 1XlO remedial 
directive goes into effect. 29 Tables 10 and 11 present the results of these calculations. 
29 The approximately 140,000 CMVs covered under the EOBR1 rule, the 1X1O group, represent about 10.8 percent 
of the total number ofLH CMVs that have not yet been outfitted with EOBRs. CMVs in the 1X1O group were 
found to have double the violation rate and 1.4 times the crash risk per HOS violation compared to other carriers. 
The unadjusted per EOBR cost is implicitly a weighted average of 1X1O and other CMVs, so that: 
(a) WeightedAverageCost = (l40,0001X1O CMVs x 2violation rate x UnweightedAverageCost + (1,295,000CMVs 
- l40,0001X1O CMVs) x UnweightedAverageCost) 7 1,295,000CMVs 
(b) UnweightedAverageCost 7 WeightedAverageCost = 1,295,000CMVs 7 (l40,0001X1O CMVs x 2violation rate 
+ (1,295,000CMVs - 140,0001X1O CMVs)) . 
Solving this equation yields a value of 0.90 as an adjustment factor for compliance costs, that is, per EOBR

5 Paperwork Savings 
5.1 Summary of Paperwork Savings 
The use of EOBRs will significantly reduce the paperwork and recordkeeping burden associated 
with the HOS regulations. Drivers will benefit the most: EOBRS will greatly reduce the time 
they spend completing their RODS and eliminate the time that some of them currently spend 
forwarding their RODS to their employers while they are away from the motor carriers' 
terminals. Comments received for the NPRM on the EOBR I rule suggest that carriers often do 
not recognize these savings because drivers are not always compensated for completing these 
tasks. Regardless, the Agency has long recognized in the estimates it prepares for the HOS 
compliance costs for non-lXlO CMVs are 0.90 times the average for all CMVs. An analogous safety benefit 
adjustment equation that includes the higher crash risk is: 
(b2) UnweightedAverageBenefit + WeightedAverageBenefit = 1,295,000CMVs + (l40,0001XlO CMVs x 
2violation rate x l.4CrashRisk + (l,295,000CMVs - 140,0001XIO CMVsยป. 
Solving this second equation yields a value of 0.84 as an adjustment factor for safety benefits. 
22 
Information Collection Request supporting statements that the largest portion of burden falls 
directly to drivers. With EOBR use, carriers will accrue clerical time savings and will altogether 
avoid the cost of purchasing paper log books. Table 12 below summarizes the paperwork and 
recordkeeping savings for each driver using an EOBR.

$486 $56 $116 $30 $688 
5.2 Labor Costs 
The Agency estimated the hourly labor costs of drivers and motor carrier clerical staff. A motor 
carrier employee at some supervisory level would also handle the RODS in their duties 
reviewing them, but the Agency assumes that electronic RODS will undergo the same scrutiny as 
paper RODS, and therefore does not estimate any time savings for these employees. This 
analysis uses a fringe benefit percentage of 1.5230 for motor carrier staff and a base wage of $15 
per hour for clerical staff and $18 for drivers.3l MUltiplying these base wages by the fringe 
benefit factor yields labor costs of about $23 for clerks and $27 for drivers. Drivers are assumed 
to undertake these activities during non-compensated, off-duty time, whereas filing is part of 
normal paid clerical duties. The clerical wage was inflated by 27 percent to include firm 
overhead.32 The final labor costs used were $29 for clerks and $27 for drivers.

EOBRs do not fully eliminate driver time spent logging HOS. Although changes from on-duty 
driving to on-duty non-driving are logged automatically by monitoring of the CMVs motion, a 
driver will still have to interact with these devices to log in at the beginning of the work shift, to 
log out at the end of the work shift, and to change duty status to off-duty and, if applicable, 
sleeper berth time. The Agency estimates that drivers fill out on average 240 RODS per year. 
EOBRs are estimated to reduce the amount of time drivers spend logging their HOS by 4.5 
minutes per RODS. EOBRs are also assumed to completely eliminate the time drivers spend 
filing or forwarding their RODS to the carriers, which the Agency estimates takes 5 minutes and 
occurs 25 times per year. These estimates match those used in the currently approved HOS 
Information Collection Request supporting statement. Total annual estimated time savings per 
driver are 18 hours for filling out the RODS (4.5 minutes x 240 RODS -:- 60 minutes per hour) 
and 2.08 hours for forwarding RODS (5 minutes x 25 occurrences -:- 60 minutes per hour). 
These result in annual labor or time cost savings per driver of $486 (18 hours x $27 per hour) 
plus $56 (2.08 hours x $27 per hour). The Agency seeks comment from the public on the 
accuracy of these estimates. 
5.4 Clerical Time Savings 
Because electronic RODS will likely be automatically transmitted and stored on a secure 
website, carrier clerical staff will no longer have to handle these documents. The Agency had 
estimated that it took carrier clerical staff only a minute to file each RODS, and EOBRs will now 
completely eliminate that task, resulting in annual time savings of 4 hours per driver (l minute x 
240 RODS -:- 60 minutes per hour). The labor cost saving of clerical time is $116 (4 hours x $29 
per hour). 
5.5 Paper Cost Savings 
Vendors such as JJ Keller sell bound packets containing a month's worth of paper RODS for 
about $2.50. EOBRs will eliminate the need for these materials, resulting in annual cost savings 
per driver of $30 (12 monthly log books x $2.50). 
6 Results of Analysis 
24 
6.1 Results for All Options 
Tables 13, 14, and 15 show the steps used to arrive at the final cost and benefit figures. Table 13 
establishes the numbers of drivers and CMVs affected, and what fraction of CMVs will require 
wholly new EOBR purchases rather than upgrades to FMS. Table 14 applies the figures in table 
13 to per unit or per driver estimates of costs and benefits to arrive at totals for all operations 
included under each option. Table 15 shows net benefits under the two alternate HOS baselines. 
Net benefits are positive for all three options, although they are substantially lower in option 3 
with the inclusion of SH operations exempt from RODS.

6.2 Alternative Implementation Schedule, Results for All Options 
FMCSA also evaluated an alternative implementation plan, one that would allow for gradual 
adoption of EOBRs by motor carriers over a five-year period. One of many possible 
implementation schedules would require EOBRs in all motorcoaches in year 1, other passenger 
carrying operations in year 2, bulk HM operations and large property carriers in year 3, medium 
sized property carriers in year 4, and small property carriers in year 5. Although after 
implementation has been completed, net benefits would be about the same for both the 
alternative and proposed implementation schedules, they are slightly lower under the five-year 
26 
option because some net benefits are delayed later in the ten-year horizon evaluated in this RIA. 
Appendix G contains a detailed explanation of how these estimates were calculated. Tables 16, 
17, and 18 show the steps used to arrive at these cost and benefit figures. Net benefits are again 
positive for all three options, although they are substantially lower in option 3 with the inclusion 
of SH operations exempt from RODS.

8 Sensitivity Analyses 
8.1 Faster Rate of Voluntary EOBR Adoption 
The Agency considered if its EOBR adoption forecast was too low, and evaluated the cost and 
benefits of its options using higher levels of voluntary use. Carriers that would voluntarily use 
EOBRs may have delayed their purchases until the final technical specifications for the devices 
were published and until devices compliant with these specifications became available. 
Furthermore, the publication of this NPRM and the potential subsequent final rule may prompt 
carriers to get ahead of the implementation schedule, in particular if they believe there is a risk of 
units not being available when widespread required use begins. The Agency created estimates of 
costs and benefits based on a doubling of its forecast for voluntary EOBR use. The results of 
this analysis are presented in table 21.

8.2 Other Agency Actions Improving Enforcement 
The Agency is poised to propose and implement several other rules and programs that it 
anticipates will improve safety before this EOBR rule would become effective. The most 
notable of them with regards to HOS enforcement is the Comprehensive Safety Analysis (CSA), 
under which the Agency will propose to perform targeted interventions on carriers' specific 
problem areas rather than rely solely on comprehensive compliance reviews. One of those 
specific problem areas is driver fatigue/HOS compliance. This will allow the Agency to spread 
its enforcement resources over more carriers and will lead to more carriers facing enforcement 
actions for poor HOS compliance. 
In the main body of the analysis, the Agency did not attempt to forecast additional safety and 
compliance improvements that would precede the effective date of this rule. It did find that 
roadside inspection HOS OOS violations have declined to about 84 percent of their 2004 levels, 
and in this sensitivity analysis FMCSA assumes that by the first compliance date, violations will 
drop again to 84 percent of their current levels, for a cumulative effect of about 70 percent 
(84%x84% - 70%) of their 2004 levels. The Agency also observed that the average number of 
annual fatal crashes over 2007 and 2008 was 93 percent of the amount calculated for the 2003 
HOS RIA analysis, and assumes that by the first compliance date fatal crashes will have dropped 
to 93 percent of their current levels, for a cumulative effect of about 85 percent (93%x93%-
31 
85%) of the levels estimated in the 2003 HOS baseline, a 15 percent (100%-85%) reduction the 
attainable safety benefit pool. The results of this analysis are presented in table 22. Net benefits 
are negative for option 3 with the current HOS rules as a baseline.

8.3 Alternate Values of Statistical Life 
The Agency calculated safety benefits and net benefits using a lower value of statistical life 
(VSL), $3.3 million, and a higher VSL, $8.7 million, as compared to the primary estimate of 
$6.0 million (all VSL figures in year 2008 dollars). The results of these alternative analyses are 
presented in tables 23 and 24 below. With a lower VSL, option 3 has negative net benefits under 
both implementation plans, and option 2 has negative net benefits with the five-year schedule 
only when the current HOS rules are the baseline. All options have positive net benefits when an 
32 
$8.7 million VSL is used.

9 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
9.1 Introduction 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of the regulatory action on small business and 
other small entities and to minimize any significant economic impact. The term "small entities" 
comprises small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of 
less than 50,000. Accordingly, DOT policy requires an analysis of the impact of all regulations 
on small entities, and mandates that agencies strive to lessen any adverse effects on these 
businesses. 
A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis must contain the following: 
A description of the reasons for the action by the Agency. 
A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the rule. 
A description - and, where feasible, an estimate of the number - of small entities to which the 
rule applies. 
A description of the reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule, 
including an estimate of the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirement and 
the types of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record. 
Identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules that may duplicate, overlap, 
or conflict with the rule. 
A description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities 
35 
9.2 Description of Reasons for Action by the Agency. 
FMCSA proposes to amend Part 395 of the FMCSRs to require the installation and use of 
EOBRs for most CMV operations. CMV drivers are currently required to record their HOS 
(driving time, on- and off-duty time) in paper logbooks, although some carriers have voluntarily 
adopted an earlier standard for HOS recording using devices known as AOBRDs. On April 5, 
2010, FMCSA published a rule mandating EOBR use for a two-year period by commercial 
motor carriers that fall under the Remedial Directive defined in Subpart J of Part 385 (75 FR 
17208). Remedial Directive carriers are required to install EOBRs in each CMV regardless of 
the date of manufacture of the vehicle. 33 These carriers will have been found during a single 
compliance review (CR) to have violation rates greater than or equal to 10% for the HOS rules 
listed under the Appendix C of Part 385 of the FMCSRs. Although, after the compliance date of 
EOBR I, EOBRs will already be required for those carriers with the poorest compliance records 
with the HOS regulations, the Agency believes that the benefits of EOBR use by the remaining 
majority of the motor carrier industry will exceed the costs associated with these devices. 
The HOS regulations are designed to ensure that driving time, one of the principal 
"responsibilities imposed on the operators of commercial motor vehicles," does "not impair 
their ability to operate the vehicles safely" (49 U.S.c. 31136(a)(2)). Driver compliance with the 
HOS rules helps ensure that "the physical condition of commercial motor vehicle drivers is 
adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely" (49 U.S.c. 31136(a)(3)). FMCSA 
believes that properly designed, used, and maintained EOBRs would enable motor carriers to 
track their drivers' on-duty driving hours accurately, thus preventing regulatory violations or 
excessive driver fatigue. 
Improved HOS compliance will prevent commercial vehicle operators from driving for long 
periods without opportunities to obtain adequate sleep. Sufficient sleep is necessary to ensure 
that a driver is alert behind the wheel and able to respond appropriately to changes in the driving 
33 A provision has been included to exempt Remedial Directive carriers from EOBR use if they already employ 
AOBRDs. 
36 
environment. 
Substantial paperwork and recordkeeping burdens are also associated with HOS rules, including 
time spent by drivers filling out and submitting paper RODS and time spent by motor carrier 
staff reviewing, filing, and maintaining these RODS. EOBRs will eliminate all of the clerical 
tasks associated with the RODS and significantly reduce the time drivers spend recording their 
HOS. These paperwork reductions offset most of the costs of the devices. 
9.3 Objectives and Legal Basis. 
The Agency is issuing an NPRM proposing to mandate the use of EOBRs by the majority of 
CMVoperations. The objective is to reduce the number of crashes caused by driver fatigue that 
could have been avoided had the driver complied with the HOS rules. The legal basis for this 
proposed rule is described in the NPRM. 
9.4 Small Entities Affected. 
Under criteria established by the Small Business Administration (SBA), firms with annual 
revenues of less than $25.5 million are considered small for all North American Industrial 
Classification System (NAICS) codes falling under the truck transportation sub-sector (NAICS 
484) or the bus transportation sub-sector (NAICS 485). Many motor carriers, however, are 
private carriers that transport goods or passengers for parent companies who are primarily not 
engaged in truck transportation, for example, airlines, railroads, retail stores, and landscaping or 
home contracting businesses with SBA size thresholds associated with their industries that are 
different from those used for truck or bus transportation. 
FMCSA does not collect revenue data for most carriers nor can it identify carrier-by-carrier 
which industry sub-sectors each firm belongs to. Carriers do, however, report the number of 
power units they operate in the U.S. on Form MCS-150. With regards to truck power units, the 
Agency determined in the 2003 Hours of Service Rulemaking RIA34 that a power unit produces 
34 Regulatory Analysis for: Hours of Service of Drivers; Driver Rest and Sleep for Safe Operations, Final Rule-
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. 68 FR 22456 (Apr. 23,2003). 
37 
about $172,000 in revenue annually (adjusted for inflation).35 According to the SBA, motor 
carriers with annual gross revenue of $25.5 million are considered small businesses.36 This 
equates to about 150 power units (25,500,000/172,000). FMCSA believes that this 150 power 
unit figure would be applicable to private carriers as well: Because the sizes of the fleets they are 
able to sustain are indicative of the overall size of their operations, large CMV fleets can 
generally only be managed by large firms. There is a risk, however, of overstating the number of 
small businesses because the operations of some large non-truck or bus firms may require only a 
small number of CMVs. The Agency has identified about 482,000 motor carriers that operate 
150 or fewer power units, about 99% of property carriers. 
For passenger carriers, the Agency conducted a preliminary analysis to estimate the average 
number of power units (PUs) for a small entity earning $7 million annually, based on an 
assumption that a passenger carrying CMV generates annual revenues of $150,000. This estimate 
compares reasonably to the estimated average annual revenue per power unit for the trucking 
industry ($172,000). A lower estimate was used because buses generally do not accumulate as 
many vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per power units as trucks37, and it is assumed therefore that 
they would generate less revenue on average. The analysis concluded that passenger carriers 
with 47 PUs or fewer ($7,000,000 divided by $150,000IPU = 46.7 PU) would be considered 
small entities. The Agency examined its registration data and found that 96% of, or just over 
19,000, interstate passenger carriers have 47 PUs or fewer. 
The Agency seeks comment on other ways to minimize the impact on small entities. FMCSA is 
often contacted with public inquiries about EOBR devices, and will continue to address these 
questions. Following the pattern of previous rulemakings, the Agency will conduct outreach 
once a final rule is issued. The Agency notes that all registered motor carriers are subject to this 
rule. This includes small non-profits. This does not include small governmental jurisdictions.

9.5 Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements. 
FMCSA believes that implementation of the proposed rule would not require additional 
reporting, recordkeeping, or other paperwork-related compliance requirements beyond what are 
already required in the existing regulations. In fact, the proposed rule is estimated to result in 
paperwork savings, particularly from the elimination of paper RODS. Furthermore, the carriers 
would experience compensatory time-saving or administrative efficiencies as a result of using 
EOBR records in place of paper RODS. The level of savings would vary with the size of the 
carrier implementing the systems (larger carriers generally experience greater savings). 
Under current regulations, most CMV drivers are required to fill out RODS for every 24-hour 
period. The remaining population of CMV drivers is required to fill out time cards at their 
workplace (reporting location). Motor carriers must retain the RODS (or timecards, if used) for 6 
months. FMCSA estimates the annual recordkeeping cost savings from this proposed rule of 
about $688 per driver. This is comprised of $486 for a reduction in time drivers spend 
completing paper RODS and $56 submitting those RODS to their employers; $116 for motor 
carrier clerical staff to handle and file the RODS; and $30 for elimination of expenditures on 
blank paper RODS for drivers. Two of the options discussed in the NPRM extend the EOBR 
mandate to carrier operations that are exempt from the RODS. Paperwork savings will not 
accrue to drivers engaged in these operations. 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.c. 3501 et seq.), Federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the OMB for each collection of information they conduct, sponsor, or 
require through regulations. This NPRM proposes regulatory changes to several parts of the 
FMCSRs, but only those applicable to part 395, "Hours of Service of Drivers," would alter or 
impose information collection requirements. The information collection requirements of this 
NPRM would affect OMB Control Number 2126-0001, which is currently approved through 
August 31, 2011, at 181,270,000 burden hours. 
OMB requires agencies to provide a specific, objective estimate of the burden hours imposed by 
their information collection requirements (5 CFR 1320.8(a)(4)). This NPRM proposes a 
compliance date 3 years after the date of publication of the final rule to allow regulated entities a 
39 
reasonable opportunity to satisfy its requirements. The PRA limits estimates of paperwork 
burdens to a 3-year period; during the initial 3 years following publication of a final rule in this 
matter, the requirements of part 395, including information collection requirements, would 
remain unchanged. Consequently, the Agency estimates the paperwork burden of this proposal 
to be 181,270,000 burden hours, as currently approved by OMB. At an appropriate time, the 
Agency will provide notice and request public comment on the paperwork burden of part 395 
after the initial 3-year period of this rule; at the present time, the Agency believes that the 
regulatory changes proposed by this NPRM will ultimately affect a net reduction in the 
paperwork burden of OMB Control Number 2126-0001. 
9.6 Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Rule 
The Agency did not identify any Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the rule. 
9.7 Steps to Minimize Adverse Economic Impacts on Small Entities 
Of the population of motor carriers that FMCSA regulates, 99% are considered small entities 
under the SBA's definition.38 Because small businesses are such a large part of the demographic 
the Agency regulates, providing exemptions to small business to permit noncompliance with 
safety regulations is not feasible and not consistent with good public policy. The safe operation 
of CMVs on the Nation's highways depends on compliance with all of FMCSA's safety 
regulations. Accordingly, the Agency will not allow any motor carriers to be exempt from 
coverage of the proposed rule based solely on a status as a small entity. 
FMCSA analyzed an alternative 5-year implementation schedule that would have provided a 
longer implementation period for small businesses. However, the estimated cost of compliance 
for motor carriers, including small businesses, did not decrease from the 3-year "baseline" 
proposed implementation period. Furthermore, a considerably longer implementation period 
could compromise the consistency of compliance-assurance and enforcement activities, and 
thereby diminish the rule's potential safety benefits. Therefore, the Agency's proposal includes 
38 (482,000 property carriers + 19,000 passenger carriers) + 504,000 total carriers = 99.4% 
40 
a single compliance date for all motor carriers that would be subject to the new rule's 
requirements. 
However, the Agency recognizes that small businesses may need additional information and 
guidance in order to comply with the proposed regulation. In order and to improve their 
understanding of the proposal and any rulemaking that would result from it, FMCSA proposes to 
conduct outreach aimed specifically at small businesses. FMCSA'would conduct Webinars and 
other presentations as needed and upon request, at no charge to the participants. These would be 
held after the final rule has published and before the rule's compliance date. To the extent 
practicable, these presentations will be interactive. Their purpose will be to describe in plain 
language the compliance and reporting requirements so they are clear and readily understood by 
the small entities that will be affected. The technical requirements the EOBR device and support 
systems used by small businesses must be identical to those established in the April 5, 2010 final 
rule, as amended (75 FR 17208; amended at 75 FR 55488, Sept. 132010ยป, codified in Appendix 
A to Part 395. This section establishes the minimum performance standards for the devices. 
Today's rule would likely become effective no earlier than 2014, four years after the technical 
specifications were published in EOBR I, and two years after the first lxlO remedial directive 
carriers will have been required to use the devices. EOBRs are expected to reduce business costs 
related to HOS Compliance, and can be used to increase other business-related efficiencies and 
reduce costs. 
EOBRs can lead to significant paperwork savings that can in part or fully offset the costs of the 
devices. The Agency, however, recognizes that these devices entail a significant up-front 
investment than can be burdensome for small carriers. At least one vendor, however, provides 
free hardware and recoups the cost of the device over time in the form of higher monthly 
operating fees. The Agency is also aware of lease-to-own programs that allow the carriers to 
spread the purchase costs over several years. Nevertheless, the typical carrier would likely be 
required to spend $1,500-$2,000 per CMV to purchase and install EOBRs, and several hundred 
dollars per year for service fees. This estimate is higher than the estimate used in the April 2010 
EOBR rulemaking for two primary reasons. 
41 
This proposed mandate would be permanent and also would require EOBRs to be installed and 
used in more than 20 times as many CMVs than were estimated to be affected by the April 5, 
2010, final rule. Therefore, the Agency cannot assume that an adequate number of the lower-cost 
devices would be available to meet the needs of that larger market. Current revenue data from 
the manufacturer of the device cited in the April 2010 final rule indicate that its market share is 
relatively low. 
A second reason for using a higher cost for this analysis is that, in response to motor carrier 
customer demand, EOBR suppliers have expanded the functionality of their products and 
services. Hours-of-service recording and monitoring are functions commonly offered as part of 
comprehensive fleet management systems, rather than in stand-alone devices. Many motor 
carriers are recognizing the potential operational benefits they can gain from the use of fleet 
management systems, and the marketplace is responding with products and services tailored to 
motor carriers of all sizes. However, the Agency is not dismissing the possibility that "stand-
alone" EOBRs, providing only hours-of-service recording and reporting (similar to the first 
AOBRDs in the 1980s), may be offered for sale or lease at a lower cost than devices with other 
functionalities in addition to HOS compliance. The Agency requests comments and data about 
EOBR cost. 
Based on direct expenence with the devices and conversations with vendors, the Agency 
believes these devices are extremely durable and can be kept operational for many years. In 
addition to purchase costs, carriers would also likely spend about $40 per month per CMV for 
monthly service fees. 
42 
10 Unfunded Mandates Reform Analysis 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires Agencies to evaluate whether an Agency 
action would result in the expenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or 
by the private sector, of $140.8 million or more (as adjusted for inflation) in anyone year, and if 
so, to take steps to minimize these unfunded mandates. This rule would not result in the 
expenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, of $140.8 million or more in 
anyone year, nor would it affect small governments, as they are excluded from this rule. As table 
25 shows, this rulemaking would result in private sector expenditures in excess of the threshold 
for all of the proposed options. Gross costs, however, are expected to be more than offset in 
savings from paperwork burden reductions.

Appendix A Derivation of Carrier, Driver, and CMV Counts 
FMCSA used two recently conducted rulemaking analyses and data for years 2007 through 2009 
from the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) for its estimates of carriers, 
drivers, and CMVs. Estimates of about 500,000 active carriers and 4,000,000 CMV drivers were 
developed for the Drivers of CMVs: Restricting the Use of Cellular Phones (hereafter "cell 
phone") proposed rule. 39 The RIA prepared for the 2010 HOS NPRM estimated 1,472,000 LH 
or over-the-road (OTR) tractors and 1,619,000 LH or OTR drivers, the latter estimate derived by 
having applied an industry average of 1.1 drivers per CMV.40 The estimate in this RIA of total 
CMVs was derived by dividing the 4,000,000 driver estimate in the cell phone rule by the 1.1 
driver-per-CMV average, resulting in an estimate of 3,637,000 CMVs. SH estimates were 
derived by subtracting the LH estimates from the totals. The Agency did not develop estimates 
for the number of LH and SH carriers due to the overlap between the two types of operations, 
that is, not all carriers specialize by length of haul, and many conduct both types of operations. 
Separate estimates of the numbers of carriers engaged in LH and SH operations were not needed 
for the cost and benefit calculations.

Carriers Drivers CMVs Drivers CMVs Drivers CMVs 
504 4,000 3,637 1,619 1,472 2,381 2,165 
MCMIS data on the type and number of CMVs are generally more accurate than those on 
drivers. Carriers report both types of information when they register for their DOT numbers on 
the MCS-150 forms, and are required to update this information at least once every two years. 
The MCS-150 registration forms contain information on the types of equipment carriers operate 
and if they haul bulk quantities of hazardous materials. Counts of total CMVs by type of vehicle 
are believed to be reasonably accurate and can be reconstructed quickly from the MCMIS data. 
39 75 FR 80014 (Dec. 21, 2010). 
40 See section 2.1.3 and Appendix A of the 2010 HOS NPRM RIA. 
44 
Counts of CMV s are also used to parse non passenger carrying, non bulk hazmat operations into 
three categories: large (greater than 1,000 power units), medium (151 to 1,000 power units), and 
small (150 or fewer power units). Driver counts do not identify the types of operations, 
passenger versus property, or the type of cargo that drivers transport. Due to high occupational 
turnover, driver counts can be fluid, and a particular driver may not drive the same type of 
vehicle or cargo throughout the year. For these reasons, the Agency simply applied the 1.1 
driver-per-CMV estimate for the CMV totals to estimate the drivers working in each type of 
operation.

Drivers 4,000 54 199 396 1,860 711 780 (CMVSx1.1) 
Although the counts of drivers by type of operation in the MCMIS data were unsuited to this 
analysis, the Agency did use information on the number of SH ("within 100-Mile Radius") and 
LH ("beyond 100-Mile Radius") drivers reported by carriers on the MCS-150 form. Using these 
data, the Agency constructed estimates of the average fractions of carrier operations by length of 
haul for each of the groups (table 28). Because it began with estimates of total, LH, and SH 
operations, FMCSA estimated each of the categories of operations, and then used the small 
carrier group as a residual to ensure that the sum across all the groups equaled the total, that is, 
Small = Total - Motorcoach - Other Passenger - Bulk Hazmat - Large - Medium. As a next 
step, the percentages in table 28 were applied to the figures in table 27 for the final counts of 
CMVs and drivers by type of operation and length of haul, shown in table 29.

Appendix B Forecasts of EOBR and FMS Use 
To forecast EOBR and FMS use, the Agency fit a model to the few data points it had on the 
percentage of CMVs equipped with these devices. The Agency picked 1990 as a starting point: 
around that year the first AOBRDs were introduced and FMS41 first came on the market. Those 
early FMS would have had none of the functionality required for HOS logging as defined in 
EOBR I, but the Agency assumes that early adopters will have upgraded their FMS to those with 
fully compliant EOBR functions by the time the rule being proposed here will become effective. 
The Agency relied on a simple model for technology adoption called a diffusion model. A study 
by Ryan and Gross (1943)42 on farmers' adoption of hybrid seed technology is widely 
recognized as the starting point for modem research into the technological diffusion process. A 
more formal mathematical analysis of this earlier study was presented by Griliches (1957).43 
The general premise is that the total percentage of new technology adopters will follow a 
cumulative normal distribution extending over time. Using 1990 as an approximate starting 
point, the Agency fitted diffusion curves to the 1990 starting point and other available data points 
on motor carrier technology use. Charts 1 and 2 display those fitted curves.

Table 30 shows the percentages for FMS and EOBR used from each of the diffusion model 
curves and the final estimates of technology adoption used in the analysis. As of 2005, the 
percentage of SH operations using FMS was about one-third the percentage of LH operations 
48 
using this technology (8% for SH versus 25% for LH).44 The Agency does not have sufficient 
data to estimate separate SH technology adoption curves, and assumes that technology adoption 
for SH will be one-third that of LH for any point on the diffusion curves. Last, beginning in 
2012, the percentage of power units affected by the EOBR I 1X10 remedial directive was added 
on top of the percentages of EOBR voluntary users.

Appendix C Improvements in HOS Compliance 
FMCSA examined CMV roadside inspection data from 2004, the first full year the main 
provisions of the current HaS rules were in effect, through 2009, the last complete year of data, 
to assess changes in carrier compliance with the HaS rules, focusing on those violations severe 
enough to warrant out of service (OOS) orders. Table 31 shows the overall HaS OOS violation 
rates and the most prevalent types of individual violations (the OOS rate will be less than the 
sum of the individual categories because an inspection can result in multiple OOS violations). 
From 2004 to 2009, the overall OOS rate declined about 84 percent. OOS rates for the 11 hour 
driving limit declined 67 percent, and OOS violations related to missing, incomplete, improper, 
or fraudulent RODS declined 84 percent. Although there are not enough years of data to 
determine whether the declines in the HaS violation OOS in 2008 and 2009 are permanent, 
incomplete inspection data for 2010 are so far showing further declines in the HaS OOS rate as 
compared to that in 2009. These data represent the Agency's best estimate of the current state of 
HaS compliance, and although there may be some uncertainty as to whether they are the most 
robust assessment of baseline non-compliance with the HaS rules, projections of future non-
compliance rates would be difficult to construct and would have high degrees of forecast 
uncertainty. 
EOBRs at a minimum will automatically record driving time; insofar as drivers use the devices 
as required, EOBRs will ensure that drivers have RODS that are complete and contain properly 
formatted entries. The Agency believes that EOBRs will have the greatest impact reducing 11 
hour driving time violations and most of the serious RODS preparation violations. However, 
because drivers will have to manually record when on-duty, non-driving periods begin and end, 
EOBRs will have limited effects on improving accurate recording of overall daily on-duty time 
(l4-hour rule violations) or weekly on-duty time (6017 or 70/8 rule violations). Improvements in 
overall HaS compliance currently reflect reductions in 11 hour RODS preparation violations and 
will continue to do so when the majority of CMV operations begin using EOBRs.

Appendix D Improvements in CMV Safety 
The ability of EOBRs to reduce CMV crashes is constrained by two factors. The first is the 
overall number of crashes occurring; irrespective of HOS noncompliance, safety deficiencies 
have to exist for safety improvements to occur. The second is the prevalence of crashes related 
to HOS violations, specifically fatigue related crashes. Safety benefits can be estimated as the 
monetized reductions in crashes that can be anticipated to follow from reductions in fatigue. An 
accurate indicator to measure safety benefits are reductions in crash risk because eliminating any 
hour of driving eliminates all increase in crash risk associated with that hour, not just the risk 
associated with fatigue coded ones. However, the Agency does not have enough data to 
determine relative crash risk for all types of crashes at each hour. Hence, we consider only risk 
associated with fatigue-coded crashes. Table 32 shows the changes in the measurements of CMV 
safety since the safety baseline for the current rules was established in the 2003 HOS RIA. The 
"2003 Rule" column does not contain year 2003 data, but a four-year average from 1997-2000 to 
which the Agency's estimate of the cost of CMV crashes available at the time 45 was applied for a 
measure of total societal damages. To update the overall CMV safety measure, FMCSA 
compared the 2003 HOS rule figures to the average number of crashes that occurred in the most 
recent two years for which data are available, 2007 and 2008. As shown in table 32, fatal and 
injury crashes declined, but the less severe category of property damage only (PDO) crashes 
increased. In total, the number of crashes has increased slightly, only 3 percent, as compared to 
the data used in the 2003 HOS rule. The Agency also applied a higher value for the cost per 
CMV crash which reflects revised cost per crash data,46 inflation to year 2008 prices, and a 
higher VSL required by DOT for all of its regulatory evaluations.47 Combined, these 
adjustments caused the estimate of the cost per CMV crash to about double. Total monetized 
damages from CMV involved crashes were 203 percent of the estimate prepared in the 2003 
HOS RIA; this adjustment is reflected in row VII of table 7. Although the total number of 
crashes did not change substantially, the monetary value assigned to those crashes led to a 
significant increase in the safety benefits attainable by mandating EOBRs.

In the 2010 HOS RIA, the Agency reassessed the prevalence of CMV driver fatigue in crashes. 
Past HOS analyses had used an estimate of about 7 percent, which limited the attainable safety 
benefits from any changes to the HOS rules or improved enforcement of those rules, such as by 
mandating EOBRs, to at most 7 percent of the total societal damages from CMV involved 
crashes. Based on data from the Large Truck Crash Causation study and public comments on 
past HOS rule analyses, the Agency updated its estimate of the prevalence of CMV driver fatigue 
to 13 percent of crashes, resulting in the attainable safety benefits increasing to 186 percent (13 
percent -:- 7 percent) of the value estimated in the 2003 HOS RIA. This adjustment is reflected in 
row VIII of table 7. 
54 
Appendix E EOBR Effectiveness 
There is little research on the effectiveness of EOBRs in reducing crashes and HOS violations. 
FMCSA examined a study conducted by Cantor et al. of the University of Maryland on the 
effectiveness of EOBRs in reducing HOS violations and crashes.48 Data used in this study were 
from a national survey sponsored by FMCSA on safety technology adoption (which includes but 
is not limited to EOBRs or AOBRDs) by large motor carriers. The final dataset included 
information from a total of 386 firms that operated on average 671 CMVs; in terms of CMVs, 
survey respondents represented about 6 112 percent of the estimated total. About 58 percent 
were for-hire carriers and the range of operations represented about 8 percent local, 44 percent 
regional, and 41 percent national. Among larger carriers, the Agency believes the survey 
achieved a representative cross section of the industry. Small and medium carriers, however, are 
not represented, but the Agency believes that these firms will likely have lower adoption of 
safety technologies. 
The researchers employed Poisson models that treat both HOS violations and crashes as count 
variables, and regressed these on an EOBR variable measuring the percentage of each carrier's 
fleet that used the devices and several control variables. The authors developed an impact 
analysis on the average effect of EOBR usage based on the estimates resulting from their models. 
Their analysis found that full EOBR adoption could reduce HOS violations 12.4 percent and 
reduce total crashes, not only fatigue-related crashes, 15.6 percent. While the estimates of 
positive impacts of the devices are credible, the Agency believes that the magnitude of the crash 
effects estimated in this study is larger than what one would anticipate from the implementation 
of this rule, and the magnitude of the reduction in HOS violations much smaller. All carriers in 
the sample that use EOBRs adopted these devices voluntarily, indicating a proactive 
commitment to reducing their fatigue-related crashes. Also, EOBRs were likely implemented 
along with other safety technology, which this study did not control for, and the EOBR usage 
variable may also capture safety improvements from reductions in other types of crashes not 
related to HOS violations. For the purposes of this analysis, the Agency focuses strictly on costs

and benefits from electronic HOS logging and monitoring, which likely form a subset of the 
crashes eliminated by the voluntary adopters in this study. 
The Agency relied on a different analysis of EOBR effectiveness that is intended to evaluate. the 
effects of these devices for the typical, unwilling adopter and that maintains analytical 
consistency with the HOS rule. It estimated the percentage of crashes occurring at illegal drive 
times (after 11 hours) to construct an upper bound for the safety benefits of EOBR use. It began 
with the Time on Task (TOT) model developed for the HOS rules, which used a logistic 
regression to predict fatigue related crashes as a function of driving time: Percentage of Crashes 
that are Fatigue Related = exp(-4.632 + 0.1226Drive Time + 0.0034Drive Time).2 Next, using 
data from FMCSA's 2008 Field Survey, the Agency constructed a measure of driver exposure, 
that is, the percentage of driving occurring, at each hour of drive time.49 The product of the 
predicted percentage of fatigue related crashes and exposure yields an estimate of the percentage 
of total crashes attributable to fatigue distributed over 20 hours of drive time. The Agency 
estimates that driver fatigue occurs in 13 percent of crashes, and as a final step rescales these 
results to sum to 13 percent. Last, as shown in table 33, the Agency calculates that total annual 
societal damages from CMV crashes are $65,510 million. This amount can be allocated to the 
fatigue related crashes occurring in each hour of drive time. This analysis is presented in Table 
32.

Sum of Effects for Hours 12 to 20 1.5% $1,014 
According to this analysis, eliminating all fatigue-related crashes that occur during illegal driving 
times results in a 1.5 percent reduction in total crashes and a monetized safety benefit of $1,014 
million. As Table 7 indicates, the baseline safety benefit related to perfect enforcement of the 
existing HOS rules is $2,658million. If the elimination of driving time violations could accrue 
safety benefits of $1,014 million, then other violations account for the remaining $1,644 million 
($2,658 - $1,014) in maximum safety benefits. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of EOBRs in improving HOS compliance, the Agency used 
roadside inspection data from motor carriers under settlement agreements with the Agency to 
install and use enhanced AOBRDs. The Agency continually monitors inspection data from these 
carriers. It began by analyzing OOS II-hour rule violations per inspection. Because multiple 
categories of OOS HOS violations can be found during a single inspection, the TOT model 
would have captured the risks of other types of HOS violations that coincide with driving time 
violations. To attempt to isolate the effects of EOBRs on other violations, these other OOS HOS 
57 
violations are evaluated only where an ll-hour rule violation had not been found. As shown in 
table 34, after the carriers began using enhanced AOBRDs, HOS violations dropped 
significantly; the differences in violation rates were significant at a 99 percent level or higher.5o

FMCSA's analysis indicates that enhanced AOBRDs can eliminate at least two-thirds of HOS 
violations. However, the Agency is cautious not to overestimate the effectiveness of the devices, 
and for this regulatory analysis, prefers to evaluate them at the lower bound of a 95 percent 
confidence interval, where 22 percent of II-hour rule violations are eliminated, 41 percent of 
violations to other time limits are eliminated, and 66 percent of RODS preparation violations, so-
called "form and manner" violations, are eliminated. The Agency is uncertain about the degree 
to which form and manner violations are the result of simple negligence or mask other time limit 
violations, but believes the latter reason is prevalent enough to justify its adjusting the estimate 
of EOBR effectiveness upward slightly. As discussed above, about one-third of the safety 
benefits of enforcing the HOS rules come from the drive time limits, and the other two-thirds 
from the other provisions. The Agency calculates overall EOBR effectiveness as the weighted

treated as proportions, rather than sample means, was conducted. 
58 
average of II-hour rule and other rule enforcement, or [(22% x 1/3) + (41 % x 2/3)] = 34%. The 
Agency rounds this figure up to 40 percent to account for form and manner violations used to 
hide time limit violations.

Appendix F Price and Availability of EOBRs 
The device examined in the analysis for cost estimates is the Qua1comm MCP-100 FMS that 
uses terrestrial communications. In past reviews of devices, FMCSA has found Qua1comm 
devices to be at the top of the cost range of available products. Qua1comm has among the largest 
market shares of FMS51 , and although its devices are slightly more expensive, devices with costs 
close to that of the MCP-100 may be the most abundant in the market when the compliance 
phase-in begins. Qua1comm reports that the MCP-100 currently costs $1675 and requires a $40 
per month communication fee, which covers all the device's main features, including HOS 
monitoring. A Qua1comm sales representative also discussed third party lease-to-own programs 
that allow carriers to spread the up-front costs of the device over a monthly payment plan. A 
typical payment plan is $60 per month over 36 months. 
FMCSA has limited information on the ability of vendors to produce adequate supplies of 
EOBRs by the compliance date of the rule. However, there is currently sufficient depth in the 
market to suggest that vendors will be able to meet demand. The Agency estimates that about 
one-half of LH operations currently use FMS or EOBRs, and is forecasting that about three-
quarters of LH operations will have been using these devices absent this rulemaking. It is also 
estimated that about 15 percent of SH operations use these devices, and that this will have grown 
to about 25 percent absent this rulemaking. Vendors are currently able to meet demand, and the 
Agency believes that they will have already been anticipating growth in EOBR and FMS 
markets. FMCSA is seeking commentary and information on vendors on their ability to supply 
EOBRs. 
Table 35 present further comparisons of devices costs. A slightly higher cost results if the MCP-
100 is evaluated with the thirty-six-month payment plan. The cost of producing devices may 
decline over time, but the Agency is uncertain, given the surge in demand caused by the 
compliance date, whether these cost savings will be passed on to purchasers in the near term.

Appendix G Evaluation of Five-Year Implementation Schedule 
The analysis of a five-year implementation plan is complicated by the fact that the Agency has 
forecast that use of FMS and voluntary adoption of EOBRs will increase over time, thereby 
reducing the number of carriers, drivers, and CMVs this rule will affect as each year passes. 
Numerous implementation schedules can be considered and evaluated. The Agency considered 
requiring EOBRs for all motorcoaches in year 1, other passenger carrying operations in year 2, 
bulk HM operations and large property carriers in year 3, medium sized property carriers in year 
4, and small property carriers in year 5. Passenger carrier and bulk HM operations have the 
highest potential for societal damages and therefore might reasonably be put first in any new 
safety rule. For all other property carrying operations, the largest carriers would be subject to an 
EOBR mandate first because they are best able to absorb the costs of these devices, whereas 
small business might be disadvantaged by simultaneous implementation, and therefore could be 
required to install these devices in year five. 
Tables 36 and 37 show the number of LH and SH CMVs and drivers that would be affected by 
the rule during each year.

These counts of drivers and CMV s are applied to evaluate the annualized incremental costs of 
benefits of each option in each year, that is, the monetized values associated only to those 
operations added to the EOBR mandate in each year. These amounts are then summed to total 
annualized costs and benefits.

Option 3 merely adds the SH operations that are exempt from RODS to year 5 of the Option 2 
implementation schedule. As shown in table 44, EOBR use in these types of operations results 
in no paperwork reduction and very small safety benefits. The addition of these operations 
results in an incremental annualized net benefit of -$174 million.

Most of the content of this Appendix has been taken verbatim from the RIAs prepared for the 
2003 and 2005 HOS rules. This appendix provides detail about FMCSA's methodology for 
estimating costs and benefits. FMCSA has not undertaken a comprehensive survey of drivers to 
measure the level of noncompliance with the HOS rules since enactment of the 2003 HOS rule. 
The Agency does not attempt to directly measure the costs and benefits of the increased HOS 
compliance that is expected with the adoption of EOBRs. Instead, FMCSA starts with the level 
of noncompliance that was found when drivers were surveyed prior to 2003. Then the Agency 
replicates portions of the analysis that was performed to estimate costs and benefits of the 
changes in the 2003 and 2005 rules, to account for the changes in the HOS rules and changes in 
drivers' compliance with the rules. Most of the content of this appendix has been taken from the 
RIAs prepared for the 2003 and 2005 rules. 
H.I Basis for 2003 Rule and Derivation of Pre-2003 Status Quo 
This section summarizes the survey data and analytical techniques used to evaluate the baseline 
level of non-compliance with the HOS rules. Survey data provided information on drivers' 
actual schedules, which were than evaluated against schedules that fully complied with the pre-
2003 and 2003 HOS rules. Simulated adjustments were made to any schedules that were found 
to be non-compliant to bring them to the minimal level of compliance. These adjustments were 
then translated into a redistribution of hours for a given driver and across drivers to estimate 
compliance costs and safety benefits. 
The status quo level of compliance was derived from a simulation of driver work and rest 
schedules calibrated with data from two driver surveys. After this status quo was established, 
FMCSA determined what changes to driver schedules would have to occur should 100 percent of 
non-compliant drivers move toward full compliance with the pre-2003 HOS rules, and then what 
changes would occur if it were the 2003 HOS rules that drivers were complying with. Results 
for costs and benefits for the pre-2003 baseline and the effects of the 2003 rules are the starting 
points for the compliance cost and benefits calculations estimated in this rule.

H.1.1 Survey Data Used in Status Quo 
University of Michigan Trucking Industry Program (UMTIP) Driver Surveys (1997-1999), 
by Dale Belman et at., with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research 
The first wave of the UMTIP data collection effort resulted in 573 long surveys completed by 
truck drivers at 19 mid-western truck stops between July and October of 1997. The second 
phase of the driver survey, conducted between summer 1998 and spring 1999, used the same 
methodology and essentially the same questions at 12 truck stops and increased the sample size 
to over 1,019 valid observations. Truck stops were chosen based on the number of overnight 
parking spaces available, which gives a measure of traffic volume. The probability sampling 
technique employed ensures that the selected truck stops match the distribution of overnight 
parking spaces by both state and size category. A potential respondent was interviewed if he or 
she reported being a truck driver, possessed a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) and was 
driving a tractor trailer at the time of the interview. 
The variables of interest contained in the UMTIP data set included hours spent sleeping, working 
and driving in the 24 hours leading up to the interview, hours worked in the last pay period,52 and 
detailed variables concerning the timing and/or duration of activities during the last completed 
trip (for example, waiting for a dispatch, loading/unloading, or driving). For descriptive 
statistics and cross-tabs, FMCSA used sample weights to account for sampling bias due to the 
size of the truck stops selected as survey 10cations.53 
In cooperation with the authors of the UMTIP driver survey, FMCSA studied customized 
statistical outputs for particular subsets of the population surveyed. These subsets were designed 
to match, as closely as possible and where appropriate, the industry segments determined to 
reflect the most relevant profile for the present regulatory impact analysis. In particular, this data 
set provided several useful variables on driver type (owner-operator, employee, union, non-
union, teams), industry segment (for-hire, private carriage, truckload and less-than-truckload), 
52 Drivers' responses pertaining to pay period were standardized to 7 days. 
53 Weights were constructed and used according to the procedures in Belman, D., Monaco, K, and Brooks, T.

Industry Program. 
71 
range of operations (local, regional, LH) and size of firm, which enabled comparative analyses of 
many different sub-groups of drivers. For comparison with other data sets, it was useful to study 
miles driven in the past year and miles driven on a "typical run." 
The UMTIP driver survey provides a representative picture of certain segments of the regional 
and LH OTR truck driver population. The survey team did not intend to capture every aspect of 
the trucking industry; rather, it was the express intent of the authors to sample regional and LH 
OTR truck drivers. For example, the authors clearly state that local pickup and delivery drivers 
are underrepresented. Analysis of their data further indicates that those SH drivers are not a 
representative sub-sample of the SH population. The survey design addressed the potential for 
bias by applying randomization techniques to the choice of truck stops, the choice of potential 
respondents, the day of the week, and the time of day. Subsets of the driver population, to the 
extent possible, were analyzed separately to ensure that dissimilar subsets were not grouped 
together. Advantages of the UMTIP driver survey are that it captures the portion of the driving 
population that will be most affected by the proposed regulations, it offers a rich range of 
information about its subjects, and its limitations are transparent. 
"Effects of Sleep Schedules on Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Performance," 2000, by 
Balkin et ale (Walter-Reed Army Institute of Research) 
The Walter Reed Commercial Motor Vehicle field study gathered sleep patterns via wrist 
actigraphy and self-reported sleep logs from 25 LH and 25 SH drivers over two to three weeks. 
The data was entered into the Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model. Participants drivers were 
recruited through flyers at truck stops and through word-of-mouth and were required to hold a 
commercial drivers license (CDL). SH and LH drivers were differentiated based on whether 
they were able to return home at the end of work periods to sleep. 
The variables of interest in the Walter Reed study were the date of observation, the time spent 
on-duty and off-duty each day, and the time of day and duration of each sleep period. This study 
represents the most accurate information available regarding truckers' exact sleep routines by 
time of day. This study does not suffer from problems of other datasets that underestimate the 
proportion of drivers with extreme schedules because they do not sufficiently differentiate 
72 
among types of tmckers or their differing work schedules over the past 7 days by aggregating 
tmckers' schedules were homogeneous over time and across groups. Moreover, with exception 
of Walter Reed, most studies ask subjects for their subjective view of how much they are 
sleeping, incremented in one-hour units, and do not differentiate between time in bed versus 
actual sleep. The strength of the WR study resides in the precise nature of its sleep 
measurements and the fact that they were carried out over a relatively long period of time. 
H.l.2 Driver Schedule Simulation Methods and Results 
UMTIP provides insufficient raw data to completely enumerate driver schedules over time. For 
instance, the UMTIP surveys ask drivers about hours worked over the last 24 hours rather than 
for a full week or for averages over time. The Walter Reed Field Study provided more 
information across days but is a small sample that was not randomly drawn and was insufficient 
to determine whether work/sleep schedules shift under current or other proposal options. 
FMCSA gathered descriptive statistics describing the distribution of schedule types from these 
studies in order to model 25-day schedules representative of those found in the real world. 
In order to model representative schedules, the Agency first estimated the distribution across 
individuals of average number of hours worked per day using the average number of hours 
worked in a 24-hour period for LH OTR drivers excluding team drivers 54 from UMTIP. The 
average number of hours worked is required because the relationship between tmckers' 
schedules and sleep is estimated and available only for sleep with hours on-duty. For modeling 
hours worked per day, a large distribution of average number of hours worked per day was 
generated, 100 random numbers, with mean and standard deviation values taken from the 
UMTIP and Walter Reed data, to represent a distribution of average number of hours worked per 
day. The random numbers are drawn from a normal distribution with a mean value equal to the 
mean number of hours worked per 24-hour period for LH OTR drivers from UMTIP (11.37 
hours per day). The standard deviation of the random numbers is equal to the standard deviation 
across LH drivers in the Walter Reed Field Study of their average number of hours worked per 
S4 Team drivers are less likely to be affected by the rule changes, and were not modeled. 
73 
day (1.88 hours).55 Rather than model 100 separate schedules with only slight differences in 
average length of work day, the analysis groups them into four bins representing average work 
day lengths around 9, 11, 13, and 15 hours on-duty on average in a 24-hour period (excluding 
full days off-duty). These bin values are chosen to divide the distribution such that the middle 
two values (11 and 13) represent about a third of the distribution under current compliance 
levels, with the remainder divided about equally between the other two values.56 This provides 
the average number of hours worked per 24-hour period worked for the current HOS rules under 
current compliance (status quo scenario). 
Next, average number of hours worked per 24-hour period is used to simulate the number of 
hours worked per eight-day work period under the pre-2003 HOS rules. This is derived from the 
frequency distribution from UMTIP of number of days worked in the last seven-day pay 
period.57 Interviews with industry experts indicate that most OTR LH drivers follow an eight-
day work schedule. In order to make this distribution based on seven-days apply to the pre-2003 
compliance baseline, the UMTIP distribution is scaled up from days worked in seven days to 
days worked in eight days. Because the mean, median, and modal OTR driver worked five days 
in the seven-day period, it is assumed that, from each group, five of every seven would work 
another day in an eight-day period.58 The majority of drivers in the resulting distribution worked 
five to eight of the last eight days. Those who work four or fewer days in eight are not expected 
to be affected by changes in HOS rules. The analysis is simplified by reducing the number of 
schedules to model by combining into one bin those who worked four or fewer days within the 
eight-day period. This group, modeled as working three days in eight, represents 12 percent of 
the trucker population. Table 45 displays the original distribution of workweek lengths as well as 
55 This figure excludes days in which the driver was on-duty for fewer than two hours. The UMTIP was preferred 
for the average number of hours worked per day due to its larger sample size combined with its more random 
sampling approach. 
56 Nine hours is approximately the average number of hours worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having 
worked up to 10.5 or fewer hours on average. Eleven hours is approximately the average number of hours worked 
in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having worked 10.5 up to 12 hours on average. Thirteen hours is approximately 
the average number of hours worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having worked 12 up to 14 hours on 
average, and 15 hours is approximately the average number of hours worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as 
having worked 14 or more hours on average. 
57 This distribution is based on only those OTR drivers who reported fewer than 24 hours of combined work and 
sleep. 
58 There is no evidence of a negative correlation of number of days worked across weeks. For this reason, it is 
assumed that the number of days worked in the seven-day period covered in the survey represents the average for 
the respective proportion of the trucker population.

No information is available in UMTIP to estimate directly the proportion of the driver population 
by both hours worked in 24 hours and the number of days worked. The proportion of drivers 
who worked on average around nine, 11, 13, or 15 hours in 24-hours is multiplied by the 
proportion who worked three, five, six, seven, or eight days in an eight-day schedule. This does 
not account for possible negative correlation between these two variables, but although this is no 
evidence of a strong negative relationship. 59 The matrix of proportions of truckers working 
various hours-per-day and days-per-eight has been termed the "driver schedule proportion 
matrix" and any individual cell within the matrix a "driver proportion cell." The driver schedule 
proportion matrix is generated first to reflect current compliance levels with HOS rules. This 
matrix is shown for the status quo in table 46. The percentages in the cell that represents three 
days of work in an eight-day period and nine hours of work in 24 is simply the product of 12 
percent and 14 percent, or 2 percent.

59 Walter Reed field study LH driver data revealed a small negative correlation of -0.05 between hours worked 
and days worked in a seven-day period. This would translate into a difference of less than a third of a day shorter 
workweek for those averaging 15 hours of work per day than those averaging 9 hours per day.

The proportion matrix was adjusted to show fully compliant schedules under the different 
numbers of hours worked per week allowed under the pre-2003 and 2003 HOS rules. Driver 
proportion cells were truncated to reflect daily and weekly limits allowed under current HOS 
rules. That is, if a group of drivers work too many hours per day or week, those drivers are 
added to a cell that complies with HOS rules. Driver proportion cells that allow too many hours 
per day are carried down to the cell with the next lower number of hours that meets the daily 
limits. If the total number of hours per week worked for that driver proportion cell remains 
above that allowed under a given HOS rule option, hours worked per day are reduced within the 
same number of days per eight-day period by shifting the proportion in that cell to the cell with 
the next lower number of hours per day working. If the cell already is in the nine hours of work 
per 24-hours cell and still is over the threshold, the proportion of hours in that cell is shifted to a 
cell in which drivers work fewer days per week. 
H.I.3 Rolling Work and Sleep Schedules 
The modeled runs from a dispatching simulation are used to predict the extent to which, under 
the pre-2003 and 2003 HOS rules, drivers' primary sleeping time (and, thus, their whole sleep-
work cycle) steadily moves, or rolls, over a series of days or remains fixed over time. 
H.1.3.1 Dispatching Simulation 
The following table summarizes the results of the dispatch simulations. The numbers in the cells 
in the table are index measures that reflect relative productivity of drivers and are different for 
the for-hire and private cases. In the for-hire case, the index reflects both number of loads moved 
76 
and length of haul. Changing HOS rules affects both the number of loads carried and the 
distances covered by a for-hire, truckload company. If such a company can make longer hauls 
with a given set of resources, it is likely that it will; longer moves for the same tonnage mean 
more revenue. In the real world, a company might use fewer resources to carry the same number 
of loads the same distance in response to less restrictive HOS rules. Either response would reflect 
the same productivity gain. Simulation analyses of for-hire operations use a fixed level of 
resources, so the output vary with a change to the HOS rules. 
The for-hire index is a composite, weighted one-third according to loads moved per vehicle and 
two-thirds according to distance moved per vehicle. Productivity measures based on delivered 
orders per driver per week and miles per driver per week can differ somewhat if the length of 
haul differs under different options. After reviewing the factors that would cause the length of 
haul to vary, and the relative contributions of driving to non-driving activities to producing value 
for shippers, FMCSA developed a composite measure of productivity that weights miles per 
driver per week twice as heavily as orders per driver per week. This weighting scheme, which 
was not intended to be precise, was based roughly on the ratio of driving time to non-driving 
time for a LH truckload shipment. 
Selection of private-carriage scenarios posed some problems. One can postulate a set of basic 
patterns for private-carriage operations, but there is no empirical basis for allocating shares of 
private-carriage activity among various patterns. Nor is it possible to specify a set of patterns and 
assert that they account for all, or almost all, of private movement. The analysis focused on just 
two private scenarios, the "national one-to-few" case and the "regional one-to-many." The 
national one-to-few case could be a manufacturer shipping from one factory to a few regional-
hub distribution centers (DCs) from which large numbers of stores or other DCs are served. The 
regional-hub DCs might be owned by the manufacturer or by its customers. The one-to-many 
case may be thought of as one of those regional DCs, shipping on to stores andlor lower-tier DCs 
as the case may be. In the private cases, output is fixed and variation in the level of resources 
used to produce that output is captured. Most of that variation takes the form of more or less 
intensive use of the same set of tractors and drivers. The index reflects the number of loads a 
driver could deliver in a standardized, fully employed week.

Estimates of total vehicle miles of travel for truckload and private carriers and numbers of 
drivers, presented elsewhere, are used to convert these productivity changes into costs (or 
benefits) of rule changes. It would be incorrect, however, to use these index numbers directly for 
that purpose. Not all companies have operations that are always pressing against HOS limits; 
many do not, as indicated by anecdotal evidence and from the findings from the UMTIP driver 
survey of hours actually worked. The impacts on for-hire TL were scaled back to 46 percent of 
the result from direct application of these indices and to 35 percent in the case of private 
carriage. The difference in these percentages simply reflects the fact that TL operations are more 
likely to be pushing against the HOS rules than are private operations. 
H.1.3.2 Results of Rolling Work and Sleep Schedule Analysis 
The total change in time of day between the beginning and end of a working week schedule at 
which an OTR driver begins his or her sleeping break period was calculated. For example, if a 
driver begins a route at 8 am on the first day of the route and ends at 4 am on the last day of the 
route before an extended (multiple-day) break, the schedule is calculated to have rolled 
backwards by four hours. The threshold at which a schedule qualifies as having work-sleep 
cycles that rolled is a difference of at least two hours over a route for a backward-rolling 
schedule and three hours over a route for a forward-rolling schedule. Preliminary analysis 
suggested that less than two-hour change in sleeping time over a driving route was insufficient to 
result in a significant change in modeled schedules. Because initial tests of the model indicated 
that a schedule that rolls forward adds about two-thirds of the incremental crash probability as a 
schedule rolling backwards, the forward-rolling threshold was set to an equivalent to three hours. 
78 
The likelihood of rolling was analyzed separately for the pre-2003 rules relative to full 
compliance and the 2003 rules, and for regional and LH operations. The number of hours a 
schedule rolls was also measured separately in order to down-weight schedules that roll for fewer 
hours than modeled. 
For the current rule fully enforced, the analysis found three of 13 regional schedules and seven of 
11 LH to shift. The majority of these were rolling backwards. The regional schedules rolled on 
average two hours and the LH over ten hours over the driving period. These driving periods 
varied in their length depending on the limits for each proposal and trip lengths for the driver 
types. FMCSA assumed that the proportion of OTR drivers is split evenly between regional 
and LH companies and combine the calculated proportion of regional and LH drivers whose 
schedules roll into an overall weighted average. That is, even though it is not expected that all of 
the drivers with sleeping times that roll to shift by a total of 10 hours, the modeling uses a 
weighted proportion that would be equivalent to the proportion whose sleep periods would shift 
backwards by ten hours. For the current rule fully enforced, the result is a weighted average of 
34 percent of drivers rolling backwards an average of 10 hours (given a five-day route). For the 
2003 rules, two of eight regional schedules and seven of ten LH roll backwards.6o

60 This includes two schedules rolling backwards nearly two hours. 
79 
H.2 Compliance Costs 
This section summarizes the results of applying the analysis of driver schedules to costs of 
achieving full compliance with HOS rules. Additional drivers (and CMVs) will be have to be 
added to shift work away from over-utilized drivers, which entail additional labor, overhead, and 
capital costs. The analysis also examined the total labor pool available to the motor carrier 
industry, not just the driver population, and concluded that there was sufficient numbers of 
workers available to shift into CMV driver jobs. Given the current under-employment in blue 
collar occupations, the Agency believes this conclusion still holds. 
Compliance costs with the HOS rules are those costs associated with changes that carriers will 
need to make to their operations to achieve full compliance with the HOS rules. Non-
compliance is the result of over-utilization of both drivers and CMV s beyond what is allowed 
under the HOS rules. Assuming carriers maintain the same level of work, additional drivers and 
equipment will have to be acquired to complete these loads without exceeding the HOS limits. 
H.2.1 Labor Cost Changes 
This section discusses the issues related to the truck driver labor supply and the methodology 
used for the labor cost changes. Compliance with HOS rules are expected to result in changes in 
labor productivity for truck drivers, leading to changes in driver labor demand. The analysis 
uses the changes in labor productivity obtained from simulations of trucking routes for the 
various options and translates them to dollar impacts based on the labor supply relationships for 
truck drivers. 
Issues related to the truck driver wage equation, as a function of job and employee characteristics 
are discussed first, followed by a discussion of the labor supply elasticity for truck drivers. 
Components of the indirect labor costs that are associated with driver wage costs are also 
analyzed to complete the discussion on various aspects of the labor cost changes. 
H.2.1.1 Estimate of Driver Wage Function 
80 
To analyze the labor costs of the different options, the Agency examined the relationship 
between hours worked and wages earned for truck drivers. The issue of individual driver wages 
is important because it is one dimension of the cost of the HOS regulations. As hours of work 
are shifted from drivers who currently work very long hours to newly hired drivers, the cost 
implications for carriers depends on the employment costs per additional hour of work by 
existing drivers relative to the costs for new hires. 
H.2.1.1.1 Data, Methodology, and Results 
The primary data source for the analyses carried out in the following section is the Current ' 
Population Survey (CPS), a household based survey conducted by the BLS every month. This 
2003 HOS RIA uses annual CPS data compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research 
(NBER) that give earnings and hours worked for a randomly chosen sample. FMCSA combine 
annual data from 1995 to 2000 and model the wage equation for non-union truck drivers only. 
The wage equation was estimated for truck drivers based on their demographic information and 
job characteristics. It was hypothesized that the wage earned by truck drivers depends on their 
hours worked61 , along with their occupational experience, and dummy variables to capture 
whether they are high school graduates, married, sex, race, whether they are in the for-hire 
industry, as well as dummies to control for year and regional effects. The details of all the 
variables used in the regression, including descriptive statistics and the estimated coefficients are 
presented in table 49.

All the variables of interest have the expected signs and most are statistically significant (except 
for some of the region and year control dummies)62. Of particular importance are the 
coefficients associated with the two hours worked variables and the distribution of wages 
implied. 
Table 50 presents predicted wages for different levels of weekly hours worked for the sample on 
non-union truck drivers only. Based on the total wage relationship, the model predicts that the 
average 50 hour/week driver earns $28,307, a 60 hour/week driver makes $33,588 and a 70 
hour/week driver makes $38,022 annually.

Hours Worked Per Week 
The results indicate that the total annual wages for drivers is an increasing function of hours 
worked that increases at a decreasing rate. This implies that the marginal cost to the firm of an 
additional hour of driver labor diminishes constantly as the hours of work increases. The 
specific shape of the total wage curve also ensures that the average wage curve is below the 
marginal wage for a significant part of the distribution. 
The downward slope of the marginal cost curve implies that as the number of hours worked by 
drivers under the HOS rules are curtailed, the cost savings to companies from cutting down hours 
of service from drivers is less than the increase in cost due to the hiring of new drivers, that is, 
giving an hour of work to a new driver costs more than the savings from taking an hour of . 
work away from an over utilized driver who would exceed the HOS limits. Another 
implication of the slope of the marginal wage curve is that every hour of driver labor does not 
cost the same for the trucking company. This is because of the "non-standard" labor-leisure 
choice faced by truck drivers. While they are on the road, they are willing to work an extra hour 
for a lower marginal wage (and cost to the firm), to maximize their earnings potential, in part 
because the value of leisure time out on the road is low. As drivers work more and more hours, 
84 
the shape of the marginal wage curve implies that the cost to the firm for the extra hours declines 
gradually. 
H.2.1.2 Supply of Drivers 
Another aspect of the labor costs of the different HOS options is related to the issue of the labor 
supply curve in the market for truck drivers. The shape of the labor supply curve determines the 
impact that changes in labor demand would have on the wage rates for truck drivers, and this is 
expressed as the elasticity of labor supply. As discussed, there is evidence in the literature to 
suggest that trucking is a very competitive industry with relatively free entry and exit and that its 
market labor supply curve is quite elastic. This is because trucking is considered a low-skill job 
with relatively low fixed costs. A small change in labor demand from additional drivers needed 
for full compliance with the HOS rules will not lead to any substantial changes in wage rates. 
H.2.1.2.1 Previous Studies 
Rose (1987) contends that the truck driver labor supply curve, especially for the non-union TL 
sector should be highly elastic. This is because "truck driving is a low-skill occupation with 
considerable turnover." She also discusses the fact that there is a large pool of drivers outside of 
the regulated interstate trucking industry who perform the same type of job - owner-operators, 
private carriage drivers and delivery drivers. She argues thus that the labor supply curve should 
be highly elastic for this occupation as a whole. Hirsch (1988) also makes the same argument 
that truck driver labor supply is likely to be highly elastic, given the fact that it is considered a 
low-skilled job. Enge163 (1998) argues that the high turnover rate in trucking, especially in the 
TL sector, indicates that this occupation has a highly elastic labor supply curve and provides an 
easy entry to new truck drivers. The author further argues that these high rates of turnover also 
indicate that trucking is a job that is difficult to perform over extended periods. There is 
evidence in the literature that the trucking industry, especially the TL sector, suffers from 
significant driver shortage. The details about how this can potentially impact the issue of market 
labor supply are discussed below. 
63 Cynthia Engel. "Competition Drives the Trucking Industry". Monthly Labor Review, April 1998. 
85 
Other studies that looked at the issue of labor supply elasticity in general (not for trucking only) 
have come up with estimates ranging between 2 and 5. (See for e.g., Lettau (1994), Eberts and 
Stone (1992ยป. These studies introduce a spatial dimension to the analysis by looking at local 
labor markets and therefore are not directly comparable to the analysis here. Nevertheless, these 
estimates provide a "benchmark" for labor supply elasticity values. Lettau64, for example, argues 
that empirical studies that look at local area labor demand-labor supply relationships, find that 
"an area's elasticity of labor supply is between 2.0 and 5.0." Eberts and Stone65 use a recursive 
model to identify the labor supply and demand relationships in local labor markets using CPS 
data. They find a labor supply elasticity of 4.9 using a five-period lag structure. 
H.2.1.2.2 Evidence from Industry Data 
Analysis of historical employment data on truck drivers confirms the view held by experts on 
this industry that the market labor supply for truck drivers is relatively elastic. Table 51 shows 
the pattern of employment and annual earnings of truck drivers in the economy from 1983 to 
2000, based on CPS data. Although driver employment has grown close to a million from 1983 
to 2000 (a growth rate of about 40 percent), growth in real wages for drivers has not been nearly 
that dramatic. In fact, real wages, in 2000 dollars, have grown less than one-half of a percent 
during the same period.

These data support the idea that employment growth for this occupation has not been 
"significantly impeded by wage movements". 
H.2.1.2.3 The Pool of Available Truck Drivers 
Wage elasticity for new drivers should ideally be considered in the context of potential truck 
drivers. Since hiring new drivers would mean shifting or attracting workers from other 
competing sectors to trucking, the Agency analyzed the existing labor pool for blue-collar 
workers to see where the new drivers could come from. Table 52 gives the number of blue-
collar workers in some of the industries that could supply additional truck drivers needed to 
comply with the new rules.

Source: Current Population Survey 
The data in the above table indicate that truck drivers account for about 5 to 6 percent of a total 
blue-collar population.66 Most of the occupations listed above can be considered similar to truck 
driving in terms of attracting people. This is one reason to believe that there is a large labor pool 
of blue-collar workers from which to attract potential new truck drivers as a result of the HOS 
options. This fact, coupled with the historical trends on wage movements, suggests that changes 
in labor demand would not lead to substantial wage effects due to the high labor supply 
elasticity. 
Some analysts believe the high turnover rates in this industry are not driven by a shortage of 
drivers. According to a study done by the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute (UGPTI)67 
in 1990, and quoted in a report on "What Matters to Drivers,,68 published in 1997, the trucking 
industry does not suffer from a "shortage of drivers" to hire from. The study claims the fact that 
this industry has been able to sustain such high driver turnover rates over the years is an 
indication that the problem is not one of labor shortage, but a lack of human resource strategy to 
take advantage of the available driver pool. 
Also, the truck driver population in the U.S. under the current conditions is predominantly 
middle-aged white males. The average age of drivers in the CPS sample is 39 years (for both 
males and females), with 96 percent of the population being male. However, according to a 
66 The definition of blue-collar workers is broader than that used by BLS to include occupations that can 
potentially supply new truck drivers.

88 
study done by The Gallup Organization69, females, non-whites (or minorities) and those that 
have less than 15 years of experience most likely see trucking as a good occupational choice. 
There is a growing segment of the labor force that has remained untapped to increase the pool of 
drivers. Improving the working conditions of drivers and making their job characteristics 
consistent with other competing occupations would be one way to attract this previously unused 
portion of the labor force. 
H.2.1.2.4 Turnover and its Impact on Driver Labor 
Another issue that is related to this and could have a potential impact on labor supply is that of 
turnover. Evidence suggests that this industry, particularly the TL sector, has been plagued by 
very high rates of turnover. 70 
The Gallup study argues that between 1994 and 2005, the industry will need to hire an additional 
403,000 drivers/year (even before new HOS). Of these, about 320,000 (or 80 percent) would be 
because of "churning" or internal turnover, drivers leaving one company to go to another, 
because of their dissatisfaction with the present job and pay. Another 34,000 (or 8 percent) 
would be needed to account for growth in the industry. And the remaining 48,000 (or 12 
percent) would be needed because of attrition, retirement and external turnover. 
The study also notes five specific job attributes that can predict overall job satisfaction for truck 
drivers: 71 
Steadiness of work (i.e., consistent driving assignments) 
Genuine care of managers for their drivers 
Pay 
Support from company while on the road, and 
Number of hours of work. 
Any improvement in the work schedules of drivers that makes it comparable to other competing 
69 See "Empty Seats and Musical Chairs: Critical Success Factors in Truck Driver Retention". Prepared by The 
Gallup Organization for ATA Foundation. October 1997. 
70 Turnover rates are the highest in the TL sector - close to 100 percent-which also has the worst pay structure -
see Belzer (1995). 
71 See "Empty Seats and Musical Chairs: Critical Success Factors in Truck Driver Retention", Prepared by the 
Gallup Organization for the ATA Foundation, October 1997, page 4. 
89 
occupations could reduce driver turnover. Pay structure is also important. Since pay is also 
listed as an important reason for the lack of satisfaction, any changes in the rules that results in a 
reduction in pay for drivers could increase driver turnover. Thus the net effect of better work 
schedules and lower overall wages is unknown. 
Based on the issues discussed above and the evidence from previous literature and data on truck 
driver labor supply, the Agency assume a labor supply elasticity of 5 to measure the impact on 
wages as a result of a change in demand for drivers. An elasticity of 5 is consistent with the 
view held by industry analysts that trucking is a fairly low-skill, easy entry job. Although there 
seem to be very limited research on truck driver's market labor supply models that are directly 
relevant for the 2003 HOS analysis, an elasticity measure of 5 is reasonable. Changes in labor 
demand due to compliance with HOS rules should not have large impacts on wage rates. 
H.2.l.3 Summary of Labor Cost Assumptions 
Using the methodology discussed above, labor costs of compliance with HOS rules are 
calculated separately for LH and SH. Using the labor productivity changes for these segments as 
inputs, FMCSA calculated the changes in the driver population that would be needed to maintain 
the same VMT. Then, using the relationships derived from the labor supply curve for individual 
truck drivers, as well as for the market labor supply, the avoided (from reducing hours of over 
utilized drivers) and new (from giving hours to new drivers) labor costs and the overhead.

Labor Supply Elasticity 5 5 
Overhead Labor Cost Proportional to Driver Labor 4.0% 4.0% 
New Driver Fringe Share 31% 31% 
H.2.2 Non-Wage Costs 
A change in the number of drivers required to conduct trucking activity requires a 
90 
complementary change in the fleet Size and supporting infrastructure. FMCSA identified 
methods for estimating the cost of new power units, trailers, and parking spaces, and 
maintenance and insurance costs of this equipment based on a review of the literature and 
relevant databases, as well as on the conclusions of its industry experts. It was assumed that no 
new docking facilities or change in mileage-based costs occurs since no direct change in the 
number of deliveries or in VMT is assumed, that is the amount of total work conducted by the 
trucking industry is held as fixed. 
H.2.2.1 Trucking Equipment 
The method used to estimate the change in the number of tractors and trailers incorporates two 
countervailing impacts from the change in labor productivity. The first is the obvious change in 
the number of trucks associated with the incremental change in the number of drivers. The 
second has to do with the fact that a change in the number of tractors and trailers, under an 
assumption of no direct change in overall fleet VMT, changes the life of the entire fleet of 
tractors and trailers, including the life of newly purchased trucks. For example, consider the case 
of lower labor productivity requiring more drivers and, hence, tractors and trailers. The existing 
fleet is now driving less to maintain the same VMT, meaning that the average life of each truck 
is longer. On average, this will translate into lower vehicle replacement based on the change in 
the number of trucks relative to the initial fleet. 
For purposes of illustration, the preceding example will be worked through a representative case 
in which 10,000 new drivers are hired by trucking companies in response to lower labor 
productivity, where the initial fleet size is 1,500,000 drivers. Table 54 summarizes the key 
assumptions used in the analysis. FMCSA assessed and incorporated a number of assumptions 
made by National Economic Research Associates (NERA)72 (2001). 
The change in motor vehicle expenditures has two implications for the economy that are 
estimated for purposes of conducting the regional economic analysis. First, the direct 
72 Mark Berkman, Jesse David, Michael Liu, and Alison Pan (2000). "A Review of the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration's Economic Analysis for its Proposed Hours of Service Standard." Prepared for the 
American Trucking Association by National Economic Research Associates (NERA). August 3. 
91 
expenditures on equipment are estimated based on the starting year of the policy, the anticipated 
reaction time by trucking firms, and the anticipated life of assets adjusted for the change in fleet 
size. Second, the assumption is made that firms will not simply bear the swings in capital costs 
in each year. Instead, firms will finance the costs over the amortization schedule at a reasonable 
weighted-average cost of capital. 
The money to cover these transactions is assumed to come from personal consumption in the 
regional economic framework. In year 1 of an amortization schedule, consumers provide the 
cash to cover the change in purchases of new vehicles, net of the first year's principal and 
interest payments. In subsequent years, consumers receive the remaining principal and interest 
payments associated with the original loan in the first year. The principal and interest costs 
represent an increase in the production costs facing trucking-related sectors in the economy.

H.2.2.2 Parking Space Construction and Maintenance 
A change in the number of tractor-trailer sets will require that additional parking spaces be 
available at terminals. The construction and maintenance of new parking spaces requires both an 
up-front capital expenditure in the first year followed by annual maintenance costs in subsequent 
years. The capital expenditures will be capitalized and amortized as a cost to the trucking sector 
with financing assumed to be substituted for personal consumption as with equipment 
expenditures. Unlike trucks, no off-setting change in the life of existing parking spaces occurs, 
because the life of a parking space is expected to be longer than the lO-year horizon under 
consideration in this analysis. 
The assumptions used in the analysis are documented in table 55. Information on parking space 
requirements for tractor-trailer sets was taken from the National Association of Truck Stop 
Owners (NATSO) and for auto parking spaces from International Parking Institute (IPI). 
Maintenance costs for auto spaces were assumed to occur at the same ratio as truck space 
maintenance to capital cost. 
Not all new tractor-trailer sets will be at the terminal at any given point in time, where 
Terminal_Max summarizes the proportion of additional spaces to sets. In addition to parking 
spaces for new tractor-trailer sets, additional spaces must be constructed for new drivers to park 
at truck stops, rest areas, or terminals while en route. The ratio of new drivers parking at work to 
new tractor-trailer sets is accounted for in variable TerminaCTD. The installation and 
maintenance costs are estimated based on the following steps.

$5,000-$7,000 per space based on information derived from truck stop operators and a national rest area database in 
U.S. DOT, Federal Highway Administration (1996). "Commercial Driver Rest & Parking Requirements: Making 
Space for Safety - Final Report." Report No. FHW A-MC-96-001O, May, Table III-2, p. 97. 
77 The International Parking Institute states that, "Surface facilities can be built for $1,500 per space in most 
cases." http://www.parking.orglmainlfaq.htm; http://wwww.fsfarchitects.comlExtGuide.htm estimates the ratio of 
spaces per acre at 80: I to 100: I at a cost of approximately $1,000 per space. It was assumed that 10 percent of 
construction was maintenance.

H.2.2.3 Insurance 
Additional tractor-trailer sets have value whether they are on the road or not. Though 
incremental'insurance costs are predominantly associated with changes in the VMT, a portion of 
the insurance cost is associated with the intrinsic value of the change in the capital stock 
represented by the change in the number of tractor-trailer sets. NERA estimated a value of 
$2,549 per new driver per year in insurance costs based on AT A data, and the 2003 HOS rule 
analysis used this estimate.78 Industry experts estimated that perhaps 25% of this cost is 
associated with the intrinsic value of the truck, and is therefore a fixed cost per CMV. The 
remainder is assumed to be variable with changes in VMT. FMCSA assumed that no direct 
change will occur in the variable portion of insurance costs since overall VMT is assumed to 
remain the same. The end result is a change of $637.25 per driver per year, or, $6.3725 million 
per year. 
H.2.2.4 Maintenance 
Analogous to the issue of insurance, additional tractor-trailer sets require some regular 
maintenance whether they are on the road or not. Though incremental maintenance costs are 
predominantly associated with changes in the VMT, a portion of the maintenance cost is 
associated with regular safety inspections and other routine, scheduled maintenance represented 
by the change in the number of tractor-trailer sets. Industry experts estimated a value of $8,500 
per new tractor-trailer per year in maintenance costs and that perhaps 25% of this cost is 
78 Based on data from Motor Carrier Financial and Operating Statistics, 1998. 
96 
associated with fixed maintenance costs per truck. The remainder is assumed to be variable with 
changes in VMT. The portion of the maintenance cost associated with new trucks is negated by 
changes in VMT in the rest of the fleet to yield no direct net change in VMT, and, hence, no 
change in the variable portion of maintenance costs. The end result is a change of $2,125 per 
truck per year, or $21.25 million per year. 
H.2.2.5 Recruitment 
The need for more or fewer drivers will have an impact on recruitment costs associated with the 
hiring of new drivers. Rodriquez, et al. (1998),79 surveyed 15 LH, for-hire trucking firms to 
determine the average costs associated with driver turnover, or chum. The study estimated an 
average cost to firms of $5,423, as summarized by cost category in the first three columns of 
table 56. The Agency excluded the costs and profits from idle equipment and the production loss 
due to chum since equipment costs are explicitly modeled and VMT is assumed to remain 
constant. It also assumed that 75% of the advertising and staff labor costs are based on fixed 
annual budgets, where only 25% is variable based on the change in number of new drivers to be 
recruited. Firms are likely to have exhausted the most important marketing channels to them 
given the high industry chum rate. Administrative support (Staff Labor) is assumed to be 
characterized by a high degree of automation, with the 25% assumption used to cover the fact 
that some back-office recruiting labor was included in this category by Rodriquez, et al. The rest 
of the costs are assumed to be fully variable with a change in the number of new drivers. The 
result is an incremental cost of $1,610 per hire as compared to the average of $5,423 based 
directly on the survey results.

$8,234 per hire. However, IeF evaluated the averages as reported in the study for each cost category and the 
average number hires to determine the value of $5,423 per hire. Values in other surveys reviewed by NERA ranged 
from $2,000 to $20,000.

-*Based on survey average of 1,311 hires per firm from Rodnquez, et at. (1998). 
The cost per driver is multiplied by the change in the number of drivers in the first year. In 
subsequent years, the cost per hire is multiplied by the change in the number of new drivers 
times the assumed chum rate for drivers. Estimates of chum rates vary from 25% to over 100% 
depending on the survey. The 2003 HOS RIA employed the chum rate of 25% assumed by 
NERA (2001).80 The cost in Year 1 is $1,610 * 10,000 drivers, or $16.10 million. The cost in 
subsequent years is equal to $16.10 times the chum rate of 25%, or $4.02 million per year. 
H.3 Safety Benefits 
This section estimates the safety benefits from reducing fatigue III over-utilized drivers by 
bringing them into minimal compliance with the HOS rules. 
H.3.1 Background on Driver Fatigue, Sleep and Truck-Involved Accidents 
This review draws on existing literature to describe the function of sleep and the established 
relationship between sleep, fatigue, shift work and performance, and CMV accidents. For the 
purposes of this review, fatigue is defined as the decreased ability to perform induced by a lack 
of adequate sleep, approximately 8 hours per 24-hour period. The review does not intend to 
duplicate other major literature reviews performed on the subject of sleep, fatigue and truck-
involved accidents.8l Rather, it is a targeted summary of key issues related to the analysis 
80 NERA claims this is a conservative assumption based on survey data indicating 25% churn per quarter for TL 
and 4% for NTL carriers, or -75% annually across all driver types (Trucking Activity Report, June 2000, ATA). 
FMCAS also reviewed a compendium of surveys compiled by J.J. Keller & Associates ("What Matters to Drivers", 
Neenah, WI, 1997) which generally confirms the range of estimates cited by NERA.

conducted for this study. 
H.3.1.1 The Function and Physiology of Sleep 
Sleep is an integral part of human functioning and longevity. Not getting enough sleep leads to 
drowsiness and impaired concentration for the subsequent non-sleep period.82 Too little sleep 
also leads to impaired memory and physical performance and reduced ability to perform on 
cognitive tasks. Without sleep, neurons may become so depleted in energy or so polluted with 
byproducts of normal cellular activity that they begin to malfunction. During sleep, the body 
also increases its protein production, enabling the repair of damaged cells, damaged from such 
external elements as ultraviolet rays or stress. Sleep is crucial to this process of cell repair and to 
the promotion of uncompromised performance during non-sleep periods. 
H.3.1.1.1 The Stages of Sleep 
Until the 1950s, sleep was regarded as a dormant, passive part of daily life. After this time, 
however, sleep became to be recognized as a dynamic process with multiple states of brain 
activity. There are five different stages of sleep, as measured through brain activity. These five 
stages are: 
Stage 1 - Sleep Onset 
Stage 2,3 and 4 - non Rapid Eye Movement (non-REM) Sleep 
Stage 5 - Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep 
The brain passes through stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (non-REM sleep) and then into stage 5 (REM 
sleep). The time spent in each stage varies depending on the stage and depending on the number 
of sleep cycles (progression through stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM sleep) completed in the sleep 
period. Approximately 50 percent of total sleep time is spent in stage 2, 20 percent in REM 
sleep and 30 percent in the remaining stages. 
Stage 1 is the shortest phase, comprised of drifting in and out of sleep. People are easily 
82 The information in this section and in the next section on sleep is from a National Institute of Health website 
http://www.ninds.nih.gov, unless otherwise noted. 
99 
awakened during this phase. This is also the phase where one experiences "hypnic myoclonia" 
where the sensation of falling is often felt. In stage 1, the body has slow muscle activity and eye 
movement. In stage 2, the stage in which most sleep time is spent, eye movement stops. The 
brain's electrical activity decreases and short bursts of rapid brain waves occasionally appear. 
Stage 2 is the first stage of the non-REM sleep stages. Stages 3 and 4 (called deep sleep) are also 
non-REM sleep stages and are characterized by very slow brain waves. 
REM sleep is the next stage. This is often referred to as the "active" sleep stage. The slowed 
brain waves begin to accelerate, breathing becomes more rapid, irregular and shallow, eye 
movement begins, heart rate increases and blood pressure rises. This lighter stage of sleep is 
where most dreaming occurs. As the sleep period progresses, the REM sleep stage increases in 
length where towards the end of the sleep period, an individual may spend up to one hour in 
REM sleep and experience very involved dreams. 
The complete sleep cycle usually takes 90 to 110 minutes. The first sleep cycles of each sleep 
period contain relatively short REM periods and long periods of deep sleep. As the night 
progresses, REM sleep periods increase in length while deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) decreases. 
By the end of a "normal" sleep period (defined here as approximately 8' hours), almost all sleep 
is spent in Stage 2 and REM sleep. 
H.3.1.1.2 Physiology of Sleep 
Most sleep experts agree that adults need between six and ten hours of sleep per 24-hour period, 
with most people requiring approximately 8 hours of sleep per day.83 Sleep most naturally 
occurs at night, due to the human body's circadian rhythm. Circadian, or daily, rhythms operate 
on approximately a 24-hour cycle and are responsible for natural peaks and lulls in hormonal 
secretions, a heightened sense of fatigue during different parts of the day - particularly in the 
earl y morning hours and the late afternoon - and the coordination and timing of other internal 
bodily functions, including body temperature and sleep. Sunlight and other time cues help to set 
and maintain circadian cycles. 
83 Pilcher, J.J., Huffcutt, A.!., 1996. Effects of sleep deprivation on performance: a meta-analysis. Sleep, 19, 318-
326. 
100 
Body temperature fluctuates in accordance with other bodily fluctuations of the circadian cycle 
and influences the timing of sleep and sleep onset. During a single day, the body's temperature 
rises and falls a number of times. Body temperature rises in the early morning hours, declines in 
the late afternoon, rises in the evening and declines later at night. People prefer to go to bed 
during certain phases in the temperature cycle over others, preferring phases when the circadian 
temperature cycle is at the nadir (lowest point).84 When body temperature is on the rise, the 
body has a greater propensity to awaken. 85 Body temperature is on the rise in the morning hours, 
when people on regular night sleep schedules tend to wake up. It logically follows that it is more 
difficult to fall asleep during these morning hours (because body temperature is rising, not 
falling). 
The sleep/wake cycle shows that the degree of sleepiness depends on the oscillating circadian 
rhythm and declining linear function (increased degree of sleepiness) based on the length of time 
spent awake. 86 
H.3.1.2 Significance of the Timing of Sleep 
The timing of sleep matters. Sleep duration is greatest after evening bedtimes and shortest after 
morning bedtimes.87 The duration of sleep has also been found to be shorter the later in the 
morning sleep begins. 88 The shorter sleep duration after a morning bedtime might seem 
somewhat counterintuitive as a morning bedtime is often the result of sleep postponed (i.e. 
longer period ~lapsed since last period of sleep). However, this decrease can be explained by the 
strong influence of the circadian rhythm on sleep duration, which makes it more difficult to sleep 
during daytime hours than it is during nighttime hours. 
A number of studies have shown that duration of sleep is influenced by the time of day of sleep.

101 
A survey found that night workers, who by default must sleep in some part, or entirely, during 
the day, slept three hours less than the recommended eight hours required to prevent sleep debt.89 
Another study found that night workers (shift starting around 2200 or 0000) slept on average 3.3 
hours less than their day-working counterparts (shift starting around 0800), sleeping 4.3 hours 
and 7.6 hours respectively.9o These data demonstrate that people who rely on daytime sleep for a 
significant part of their rest are experiencing less total sleep. 
H.3.1.3 Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Debt and Impact on Performance 
Sleep deprivation occurs when an individual sleeps two or more hours less than the optimal 
amount during anyone sleep episode, eight hours being the standard optimal amount subject to 
significant variation by individual. Sleep deprivation over a series of sleep periods leads to sleep 
debt, the accumulated sleep loss over the course of time.91 The discussion in this section 
presents the results of a number of studies and the implications of sleep deprivation and sleep 
debt on performance based on the available literature. 
Sleep deprivation and sleep debt have a number of consequences for performance. Sleep 
deprivation over a couple of days leads to slower response times and decreased initiative.92 After 
one sleepless night, cognitive performance may decrease 25% as compared to the performance of 
non-sleep deprived individuals.93 After the second sleepless night, performance on cognitive 
tasks may decrease to nearly 40% the potential level. A meta-analysis found that people who are 
chronically sleep deprived, that is, have substantial sleep debt, performed at the 9th percentile of

non-sleep-deprived subjects.94 
Individuals switching from an irregular to regular schedule do not immediately achieve improved 
fatigue levels. Sleep deprived individuals with irregular sleep schedules (as could be the case 
with truck drivers) who regularized their sleep schedules but suffered sleep loss in the process 
experienced an increase in daytime sleepiness and a concomitant deterioration in concentration 
ratings, immediately after regularizing their sleep schedule.95 
These findings suggest that routine sleep schedules that allow the individual sleeping an 
adequate number of hours (approximately 8, varying by individual) during approximately the 
same time during a 24-hour period facilitate daily functioning at unimpaired performance levels. 
H.3.1.4 Fatigue and Work 
Workers experience a number of different types of fatigue while on the job. The three major 
types of fatigue affecting work performance are industrial, cumulative and circadian.96 These 
types of fatigue are described below, focusing on the literature relating to truck drivers. 
Industrial fatigue results from working continuously over an extended period of time without 
proper rest, often referred to in the literature as fatigue resulting from time-on-task. For 
example, a truck driver who has been driving for six hours, without a break, might be subject to 
industrial fatigue. Some studies have shown performance to decrease as time on task increases.97 
Time-on-task problems could be exacerbated by sleep loss, even in the early stages of the task. 
One study concluded that for sleep deprived individuals, performance is compromised even at 
early stages of performance of a monotonous task if the situation is undemanding and boring. 
This study suggests that the effect of sleepiness becomes immediately evident in the form of

Cumulative fatigue arises from working for too many days on any protracted, repetitive task 
without any prolonged break. This fatigue results from a lack of alertness brought on by 
familiarity and boredom with the task at hand. A truck driver could experience cumulative 
fatigue after driving for 12 hours, taking eight hours off and then driving another 12 hours 
(driving a total of 24 hours in a 32 hour period). 
Circadian fatigue is a function of the circadian rhythm. Fatigue is greatest when approaching or 
at the nadir of the circadian cycle, where the body is least vigilant. The truck accident rate is 
much higher during the early morning hours than during any other time of day,100 supporting the 
circadian effect hypothesis that accidents are more likely to occur when the human body is least 
vigilant. 101 
Night and rotating shift workers are especially susceptible to being fatigued on the job. 102,103,104 
Permanently assigned graveyard-shift workers sleep between 5.8 to 6.4 hours per day.105 
Rotating shift workers, such as many truck drivers, sleep even less when they work a night shift 
(5.25 to 5.5 hours). Shift workers experience disturbances in their circadian rhythm, as measured 
by changes in hormonal levels; 106 they are also less alert during nighttime shifts and perform less 
well on reasoning and non-stimulating tasks than non-shift workers. 107 Though nightshift work 
for many workers is regular (the same schedule is kept over time), truck drivers often have 
irregular schedules which can amplify the effects of circadian, cumulative and industrial fatigue

and increase the risk of fatigue-related accidents. 
H.3.1.5 Fatigue and Truck-Involved Crashes 
Fatigue increases over the duration of trips, regardless of the driving schedule l08 and total driving 
time has a significant effect on crash risk though there is variation on the point at which crash 
risk increases significantly, depending on the study methodology. 109,1 10 A study of industrial 
fatigue in truck drivers found that in over 65% of cases, truck accidents took place during the 
second half of a trip, regardless of trip length. I I I An analysis of Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety 
data in the 1970s found that about twice as many accidents occurred during the second half of 
trips than during the first half, regardless of trip duration. I 12 Another study found that the risk of 
accident increased after the fourth hour of driving and peaked after nine hours of driving.113 
These studies are among many finding that industrial fatigue plays a role in predisposing truck 
drivers to accidents. Determining the magnitude of this effect, however, and ensuring that other 
factors (such as sleep history and time of day) have been factored out, is quite difficult. 
Researchers have long asked how long a person can sustain work effort at different tasks without 
lengthy breaks, before hislher performance of those tasks becomes unacceptably degraded. 
There has always been a notion that by itself, sustained performance at a task (Time on Task or 
TOT) eventually results in a "fatiguing effect" manifesting itself in the form of slower response 
times or errors of omission. Below is a short literature review of five studies about the time-on-
task effect on driving and some conduding remarks.

Jones and Stein (1987)114 attempted to provide "adjusted odds ratios" to different categories of 
"length of time in driving" (TOT), assigning a baseline value of 1.0 to the relative risk of the 
likelihood of crashes attributable to a driving time of from 0 to 2 hours; and they presented an 
increased odds ratio of 1.2 for driving times of from 2 to 5 hours and also 5 to 8 hours of driving 
time (TOT). The work of Jones and Stein says nothing about projecting odds ratios for driving 
more than 8 hours, something at the root question of the entire discussion of truck driver HOS. 
Lin, J ovanis, and Yang (1993) 115 introduce a time-dependent logistic regression model 
formulated to assess the safety of motor carrier operations. They describe their model as being 
flexible, allowing the inclusion of time-independent covariates, time main effects, and time-
related interactions. The model estimates the probability of having a crash at time interval t, 
subject to surviving (not having a crash) before that time interval. Covariates tested in the model 
in this paper include consecutive driving time, multiday driving pattern over a 7-day period, 
driver age and experience, and hours off duty before the trip of interest. Although the work of 
Lin, Jovanis, and Yang has some appeal in the conduct of this study, their methods and modeling 
are of some concern in that they do not model beyond the 8-9 hours of driving incidents, 
something which is obviously needed to examine the HOS alternatives. 
In their description of nine logistic regression modeling attempts Lin, J ovanis, and Yang state 
that driving time (TOT) has the strongest direct effect on accident risk. The first 4 hr 
consistently have the lowest crash risk and are indistinguishable from each other. Accident 
(crash) risk increases significantly after the fourth hour of driving, by approximately 50% or 
more, until the seventh hour. The 8th and 9th hours show a further increase, approximately 80% 
and 130% higher than the first 4 hours. 
Campbell (1988)"6 states that there IS a steady increase in the probability of accident 
involvement with the number of hours driving. To look into this, Campbell used data from

dozed at the time of the accident were used to determine the time-on-task effect. The problem 
with this is that not all of the crash data was included and crashes may have been caused by 
fatigue yet the driver was not dozing at the time. It was concluded that the crossover point in 
which the proportion of accidents in the latter hours of driving is more frequent occurs around 
four hours of driving. 
O'Neill et ai. (1999)117 studied the operating practices of CMV drivers, as well as the 
relationship of these practices to driver fatigue. Drivers worked a 14-hour on, 10 hour off 
schedule driving a simulator for a 5-day week. Two 30-minute breaks and a 45-minute lunch 
break were taken during the day at regularly scheduled times. The observed recovery effect of 
the breaks was rather striking. The effects of 6.5 hours of driving were virtually reduced to the 
starting levels by a 45-minute break (O'Neil et aI., 1999). It is important to keep in mind that 
while this recovery effect is remarkable, it occurred under very strict, adhered to conditions. 
This effect took place under daytime driving conditions, the 14 hours onllQ hours off driving 
schedule that allowed for adequate rest, and scheduled breaks. It cannot be said with a 
reasonable degree of certainty that this recovery effect would occur in the same way under 
different conditions. 
Wylie et ai. (1996) 118studied four different driving conditions to test several driving fatigue 
questions: a lQ-hour "baseline" daytime schedule, a lQ-hour "operational" or rotating schedule, 
a 13-hour nighttime start schedule, and a 13-hour daytime start schedule. The authors concluded 
that hours-of-driving (TOT) was not a strong or consistent predictor of observed fatigue. 
Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between driver's self-ratings of fatigue and the 
number of hours driving within a trip while objective performance did not indicate a positive 
correlation.

107 
Based on the literature reviewed, the time-on-task effect was not quantified independent of and 
in addition to the circadian and recovery/decrement recovery factors. Therefore, the TOT effect 
was not used as a separate factor in the 2003 HaS rule analysis. 
Another important and relevant factor is time of day and continuity of sleep. Numerous studies 
have found an increased crash risk for truck drivers associated with night-time driving. I 19,120 In a 
study of a group of drivers involved in single-vehicle accidents, almost twice as many of their 
accidents occurred in the early morning hours between midnight and 0800 hours (66%) as during 
the rest of the day (34%).121 Accidents and workplace errors from studies concerning road, 
maritime and industrial operations show a peak at 0300. 122 Additionally, the continuity of sleep 
is significant. An elevated fatal crash risk was identified for drivers that split the required 8 
hours off-duty into two sessions in a sleeper berth. 123 
An arduous work schedule has also been identified as increasing the risk of truck involved 
accidents. 124 One study found that drivers on a regular 13-hour daytime-start driving schedule 
slept for 5.1 hours while drivers on a lO-hour daytime start driving schedule slept 5.4 hours. 125 
While this study only looked at daytime-start schedules, the relationship between time-off duty 
and time spent asleep is remarkable. Drivers with 11 hours off spent 5.1 hours asleep (and an 
additional .4 hours in bed) while drivers with 14 hours off spent 5.4 hours asleep (and an 
additional .4 hours in bed). The study cites the fact that drivers on the 13-hour schedule were 
within 10 minutes of their sleep laboratory and thus may have been able to get more sleep than 
otherwise. The sleep numbers for both groups are likely to be high because each were able to 
obtain their principal sleep during optimal times of the day (in accordance with the circadian

rhythm), starting late in the evening and ending early in the morning. It is possible that given the 
same schedule durations, these drivers could have slept less if conditions were different (e.g., if 
the schedule necessitated nighttime driving, if the drivers lived (or the sleep center was) further 
from their daily terminating point). 
H.3.1.6 Conclusion 
Driving requires sustained attention; it is an inherently fatiguing task in its monotony and 
repetition. 126 For many commercial motor vehicle drivers, the inherently fatiguing task of 
driving is compounded by fatigue caused by working long, irregular hours that conflict with 
natural circadian rhythms.127 Because of the economic incentives for rapid goods transport, 
many drivers may be unable to obtain sufficient, sustained, restorative sleep and may 
subsequently experience sleep deprivation or accumulate a sizable sleep debt. Sleep deprivation 
and sleep debt, as shown through this review, can lead to an increase in the risk of accidents 
through impaired performance. This fact supports the need to provide CMV drivers with 
conditions that make it possible and likely for them to get sufficient sleep, though even ideal 
conditions could not eliminate all fatigue-related crashes. 
H.3.2 Estimates of Motor Carrier Crashes Due to Fatigue 
H.3.2.1 Data and Approach to Crash Analyses 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System (FARS) and General Estimates System (GES) databases and the MCMIS Crash File 
were reviewed for the years 1997 through 2000. They provided the primary basis for crash 
estimates. Other databases including the MCMIS Census File, National Motor Carrier Directory 
(NMCD), and Bluebook were used to categorize crashes by motor carrier firm operations so that 
the resultant crash data could be linked to the industry profile and schedule/risk analyses used to 
evaluate the potential effects of proposed changes to the hours of service regulations.

109 
The crash analysis began with an attempt to extract commercial motor vehicle crashes from the 
three crash data files. Key variables included the state, and date of the crashes; vehicle type and 
configuration; motor carrier census number; total vehicles, occupants, injuries and fatalities; and 
driver, vehicle and environmental factors associated with the crashes. The goal was to be able to 
establish a profile of carriers/vehicles involved in crashes with particular attention placed on the 
apparent contributing factors or accident causes. There was an attempt made to eliminate "other 
driver" and environmental factors leading to the crash. This was done to extract truck crashes 
where the driver would probably be considered not "at fault" from the overall set of crashes. The 
key issue was to determine the extent to which CMV driver fatigue or associated factors could be 
reasonably established as a primary contributing factor in the crash. 
In conducting such an analysis, it is essential that one recognize the potential weakness in using 
police accident reports (PARs) as the sole basis for attributing fatigue as a crash cause. The 
police officers who complete the reports rarely have specialized training in crash investigation or 
even in completing the forms. One should also note that completing the PAR is no greater than a 
third priority for officers who are involved in situation assessment, emergency response and 
victim assistance, and finally controlling and then restoring traffic flow around the crash scene. 
Additionally, PARs are believed to under- rather than overestimate fatigue involvement in large 
truck crashes. 
Crashes where CMV driver fatigue is cited as a primary contributing factor should be viewed as 
the "minimum" number of crashes with fatigue as a cause. For this reason, the analysis was 
conducted to develop a more reasonable estimate of the total number of fatigue-related crashes. 
An analysis of data for crashes where driver inattention was cited within the PAR was used to 
apportion part of those crashes as fatigue-related. This conclusion was drawn from a 
comprehensive report of SH drivers that attributed more than 20 percent of all inattention crashes 
to driver fatigue. 
H.3.2.1.1 Historical Crash Data Summary 
In order to develop estimates of the total cost of truck crashes in recent years, the FARS, GES 
and MCMIS databases were reviewed to derive national summary totals of crashes by type, 
110 
fatalities, and injuries. Crashes are defined by whether or not they involve fatalities suffered by 
vehicle passengers or non-occupants (pedestrians), reported injuries where no fatality was 
involved, or property damage with no fatalities or injuries (property damage only crashes.). The 
MCMIS database tends to contain more detailed information about the vehicle configuration or 
cargo carried and is especially useful for determining the identity of the motor carrier involved in 
a crash. Historically, there has been an undercount of truck crashes noted in the MCMIS 
database versus FARS. Comparably, there still seems to be a substantial undercount of injury 
and property damage only (PDO) crashes in MCMIS versus the national estimates derived in the 
NHTSA GES database. Part of the difference is because MCMIS only records PD~ crashes that 
resulted in a vehicle being towed away, a subset of all PD~ crashes. 
The F ARS database is considered the best source of fatal crash information since it is a census of 
all fatality involved motor vehicle crashes occurring within the United States. It was used to 
develop estimates of the total fatal crashes involving trucks, the total fatalities (broken down by 
truck, other vehicle, or non-occupants) and the numbers of combination and large single unit 
trucks involved. Data were reported for calendar years 1997 through 2000 and for the average 
over the four-year period. 
National estimates of truck crashes that do not involve a fatal injury were derived from the GES 
files. Crashes, total injuries and trucks involved were reported for the injury crashes while total 
crashes and trucks involved were reported for the PD~ crashes. The GES estimates are based on 
a stratified national sample where each crash is assigned a sampling weight according the 
stratum from which it is reported. The GES estimates are always rounded to the nearest 
thousand crashes, vehicles, or injuries. These national estimates are provided below.

H.3.2.1.2 MCMIS Data Analysis 
In order to complete the baseline analysis, it was necessary to determine what proportion of truck 
crashes could be attributed to truck driver fatigue. The MCMIS Crash File for 1997 through 
2000 was used. Bus and unknown vehicle type records were eliminated from the database and 
the "apparent driver condition" variable was used to code the data records for which "fatigue" or 
"asleep" had been cited as contributing factor in the crash. The "raw" fatigue/asleep crash 
estimates for 1997 through 1999 was approximately 1.31 % of all truck crashes with the number 
dropping in 2000 to less than 1%. These very low values could seem to indicate a minimal 
fatigue rate for truck crashes. However, closer examination of the data and direct benchmarking 
to alternative data sources point to numerous deficiencies in such a simple analysis. 
As a matter of policy, the "apparent driver condition" variable has been eliminated from the 
National Governor's Association (NGA) required list of reportable data elements for commercial 
vehicle crash reports in the SAFETYNET 2000 (Version 2) reporting system. This was in large 
part due to historical under-reported and non-reported values for this variable. In 38% of the 
2000 data records, the driver condition variable was missing compared to less than 10% of the 
time in earlier years. In the earlier years, the data field was reported as "unknown" rather than 
missing in about 7% of all crash records. A problem arises in that "appeared normal" and 
112 
"unknown" are both coding options, but for analytic purposes, it is difficult to ascertain whether 
a blank value for this variable should be interpreted as "normal", "unknown" or "not 
interpretable". Previous estimates of driver fatigue associated with truck crashes have been 
hampered by this serious data quality problem. 
A state-by-state examination of the data also showed several systematic problems in the 
reporting of the driver condition variable. Driver condition was not reported in truck crash data 
records from the States of Massachusetts, Oregon, South Carolina or Virginia in any of the years 
of data examined. Additionally, fatigue/asleep was never reported as a factor in truck crashes in 
the States of Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico or Wisconsin. These data reporting problems 
result in a logical inconsistency in calculating fatigue involvement rates for truck crashes. If it is 
impossible to add a fatigue event in the numerator of the national fatigue crash rate, then the data 
from these States should not be included in the denominator of the rate calculation. The problem 
grows worse in more recent years with many more States opting to not report apparent driver 
condition at all. For these reasons, the MCMIS database should not be used to derive estimates 
of fatigue-involved truck crashes. 
H.3.2.1.3 FARS Data Analysis 
As an alternative to using the MCMIS data, FARS truck crash data for the years 1997 through 
2000 were reviewed. The FARS database contains information for crashes involving at least one 
associated fatality in the involved truck, in another vehicle, or a pedestrian. The F ARS database 
has been used as a benchmark for the MCMIS database fatal crashes since the requirement for 
motor carrier self-reporting of crashes was ended in the early 1990's. The FARS database has 
historically been held in high regard because of the NHTSA protocols for editing and coding the 
data elements within the data records. 
In order to use the F ARS database for analysis of fatigue related truck crashes, several key issues 
have to be examined. Is it reasonable to extend fatigue-related crash estimates from fatal crashes 
to injury and property damage only crashes? Since the FARS database contains data elements 
for reporting up to four driver factors, how should these multiple responses be handled? Are 
there data reporting issues for the FARS dataset comparable to those encountered in the MCMIS 
113 
data set? 
The FARS database is limited to crashes involving a traffic fatality. By definition, these crashes 
are more severe since the fatal outcome has a higher social or economic cost than would a 
comparable crash resulting in (perhaps minor) injuries or damages to property only. Fatal 
crashes certainly have other characteristics that separate them from injury only or PDQ crashes, 
especially those factors associated with speed and type of impact. In truck crashes, the "other 
vehicle" occupant is almost six times more likely to die in the crash than a truck occupant, so it is 
not clear to what extent fatal truck crash characteristics can be reasonably generalized to injury 
or PDQ crashes. 
This question is difficult to answer with the data available. A review of MCMIS fatigue 
involved crashes by crash type reveal that there was an historical trend of fatigue being reported 
in fatal crashes more than in injury and property damage only crashes. The overall data 
reporting problems for MCMIS fatigue crash rates also present interpretation problems for this 
feature of the data. Data for the year 2000 should not be used since the apparent driver condition 
variable had already stopped being used. However, for 1999 and 1998, fatigue involvement in 
fatal crashes did exceed that reported in injury crashes or PDQ crashes. 
Another estimate of the relative prevalence of fatigue in the three types of crashes could be 
drawn from the GES data. The GES database serves as a very good source of national estimates 
of total crashes and for crashes with certain characteristics (such as number of occupants or 
injuries, or by vehicle type). However, some specific details of the crash cannot be estimated 
very reliably. Derived from state databases of police accident reports, the GES suffers from 
some of the same faults as the MCMIS. There may be only one (if any) of the driver condition 
variables included in the reports and fatigue may not always be a coded or reported factor. In the 
2000 database, however, fatigue was cited as a contributing factor in 1.46% of all the fatal 
crashes, 0.94% of the injury only crashes and 0.65% of the PDQ crashes. These percentages 
were drawn from the raw non-weighted sample. Additionally, the data were not edited for 
missing values or adjusted for any other factors related to the data reporting in the files. 
With such small percentages reported in the MCMIS and GES databases, there IS some 
114 
uncertainty in concluding that FARS data for fatigue involvement in crashes can be extended to 
the injury and PD~ crashes. In real terms, the differences are negligible. In percentage terms 
the differences could be viewed as substantial. However, the FARS database contains the most 
detailed and highest quality data. There is also evidence that the historical underreporting of 
fatigue involvement in F ARS would tend to provide conservative estimates regardless. 
Since the FARS database contains four different fields for reporting driver factors contributing to 
the crash, there was some initial concern that this could introduce an upward bias in the reporting 
of fatigue involvement in crashes. For the years 1997 through 2000 this appears not to be the 
case. In most all of the cases where fatigue was cited as a factor and there were other factors 
cited, the fatigue code tended to occur first in the list. Additionally, it was reported with a factor 
that would not confound the results reported in this analysis. The two most common other 
factors reported were "ran off road" and "inattention". These accounted for a large proportion of 
the multiple factors cases. 
Finally, from the standpoint of data quality, some factors ought to be considered when viewing 
the FARS data to assure that cases are not included in the denominator of the rate calculations, 
unreasonably biasing the estimates downward. Examination of the individual data records 
indicated that there are several sets of crashes that it seems unreasonable to consider in 
calculating the fatigue involvement rate. For one set of crashes, many of the key variables 
(vehicle configuration, body type, harmful events, driver charges, impact details, etc.) are coded 
as "9's", which means unknown or unreported. In all of these cases the driver contributing 
factors are coded as "99". In another set of data records, the individual crashes can be matched 
back to the MCMIS file where the contributing factors are missing because of state data 
reporting systems and procedures. These appear in the FARS database with driver factors coded 
as "O's". Eliminating these records from the analysis set was a prerequisite to calculating the 
proportion of crashes with motor carrier fatigue as a contributing factor. 
The final step in completing this analysis was to examine each fatal crash involving a large truck 
and use the factors cited to determine whether "fault" was attributed in the crash. Crashes were 
categorized as whether the "other" (non-truck) driver was determined to be at fault and whether 
115 
the truck driver was determined to be at fault. Two other values for these variables were also 
considered and reported below. If inclement weather was cited that is so reported. If no fault 
was assigned for the crash, that was also reported. One should note that since weather conditions 
and multiple drivers may interact to provide multiple responsible conditions or persons, the 
percentages for fault attribution could add up to more than 100%. In all of the years of reported 
data, that is the case. One important fact to note from these attribution data, is that the "other 
driver" was deemed to be at fault almost twice as often as the truck driver. 
The fatigue attribution for the FARS crash data is shown in table 58. The edited data provide us 
with an estimate of between 6.60% (2000) and 8.21 % (1999) for the period examined. These 
fatigue numbers were adjusted further to account for a systematic phenomenon noted by 
Hanowski in his study of SH drivers. 128 In that study, fatigue was determined to be a 
contributing factor in 20.8 percent of the incidents where the driver was judged to be at fault due 
to inattention. When at fault, their PERCLOS (percent eyelid closure) values prior to the 
incidents were significantly higher than for other types of critical incidents.

H.3.2.2 Estimates of Crashes by Large Truck Firm Operations Type 
To estimate the relative involvement of large trucks in crashes by operations type, crash records 
must contain specific information about the trucks involved. Crashes can be classified by the 
operations of the vehicles or firms involved using either the actual characteristics of the trip in 
which a crash occurred or the identity of the motor carrier involved, assuming that the firm 
identifying number can be matched to a data source in which motor carriers are classified by 
their operations. 
The most commonly cited crash databases do not contain trip-specific characteristics. The ideal 
information for determining whether a crash occurred in long- versus SH operations would be 
the starting and intended ending point of the trip in which the crash occurred. The calculated 
distance between those two points would provide with certainty the ability to classify the trip 
according to any specified cut-off point selected for differentiating between LH and SH 
operations. 
A very good indicator for determining if a truck crash occurred in SH operations may be the 
vehicle or equipment type. Dump trucks, garbage trucks and concrete mixers are rarely involved 
in LH operations. To a lesser extent, cargo tanks are somewhat restricted to SH use. Flatbed 
trucks, straight trucks, and vans or enclosed boxes are widely used in both long- and SH 
operations. This group comprises a substantial population of the cargo body types noted in truck 
crashes. 
An alternative method for determining the operations of the crash involved truck is to associate 
the individual vehicle with a firm and then research the primary operations type for the whole 
firm. The TTS Blue Book database of 2,681 motor carriers provides two key indicators for 
specifying operations type, and also provides the US DOT motor carrier identification number for 
these carriers. Average length of haul for trips made in the year and the freight revenues from 
long and short distance transportation are reported in the database. The average length of trip 
variable can be used directly to classify carriers. A calculated proportion of revenue derived 
from short distance operations could also be used to classify carriers. There are 2,481 firms in 
the TTS database with sufficient information to be able to classify them as long or SH. With 
117 
these data, the motor carrier identification number can be used to match firm records to the 
MCMIS and (to a lesser extent) FARS crash files. There were 32,342 different firms with a 
fatal, injury or property damage only crash reported in the MCMIS database during 2000, so the 
TTS data alone cannot provide a very good match for ascertaining operations type. The 2,481 
firms with data can account for 2,016 matched crash records in the year 2000. 
Another possible criterion for establishing the operations of a motor carrier is the primary 
commodity being carried. The Blue Book database has one field for each carrier indicating the 
commodity hauled. The TTS National Motor Carrier Directory lists the top four commodities 
being carried, while the MCMIS motor carrier census lists up to 30 different commodities that 
each firm may carry. There are a number of commodities that are very clearly associated with 
SH<carriage (C<ement, garbage, tank petroleum products, coal/coke, ores, grain, livestock, et al). 
These products are associated with special equipment used (as mentioned above), are hauled by 
train when moving long distances or have some other characteristic that makes long distance 
carriage untenable or uneconomical. The relative number of long and SH firms carrying anyone 
of the 24 different commodity groups in the Blue Book data provides a very good benchmark for 
the potential classification of data in the motor carrier census. A discriminate analysis of the 
Blue Book data revealed that a substantial number of firms could be classified as long or SH 
based on the primary commodity that they carry. Petroleum tank products, dump trucks, 
agricultural commodities, film products and local cartage operations are predominantly listed by 
firms otherwise classified as SH. Firms handling refrigerated solids, refrigerated liquids and 
household goods were primarily classified as LH. 
A final set of characteristics could be used to classify carriers by long and SH operations. The 
number of power units owned or leased or number of drivers employed divided by the total miles 
driven per year provides a measure of the utilization rate of these resources. Other data from the 
Blue Book indicate that the low mileage per power unit (or driver) firms tend to be involved in 
SH carriage. Low end and high end cut-off points were established for these variables and the 
carriers at the extremes were classified according to these utilization variables. Since mileage, 
drivers, and equipment details are available for a large proportion of the firms listed in the 
USDOT motor carrier census, this analysis was conducted for all 889,381 carriers in the 
118 
database. Based on a review of the Blue Book data, a logical cut-off point of 30,000 or fewer 
miles per year per driver or power unit was established for defining SH trucking firms and a cut-
off point of 60,000 or more miles per year per driver or power unit was established for defining 
LH trucking firms. Firms with average driver and vehicle usage between 30,000 and 60,000 
miles per year were left unclassified. 
The results of these three analyses were combined to develop the overall estimates of short and 
LH involvement in the 103,055 truck crashes in the 2000 MCMIS Crash database. The crash 
data cargo body criterion was given the highest priority in the classification, followed by the 
Blue Book average trip length, chief commodity, and utilization, finally incorporating the 
MCMIS Census file commodity and utilization information. Once a crash was classified by one 
of these methods the methods following it in the priority list were not used. For the MCMIS 
commodity and utilization tests, consistency checks were used to assure that there was no 
conflict in classification using the different methods. If a conflict was detected, then the carrier 
was left unclassified. Approximately 70% of the fatal crashes and 65% of the injury and 
property damage only crashes could be classified as long or SH using this procedure. 
Table 59 shows the numbers and proportion of crashes in calendar year 2000 broken out by long-
or SH firms. The raw percentages have been adjusted to reflect the relative involvement of long 
and SH operations noted. This allocation scheme assumes that the unclassified crashes should be 
distributed proportionally to the LH and SH groups. For 2000, there was an approximate 60% to 
40% split between LH and SH operations involvement in fatal and property damage only 
crashes. LH operations were associated with approximately 55% of the injury only crashes. 
These estimates can be used with the baseline crash numbers derived from F ARS and GES to 
establish the historical baseline of crash involvement for the two different types of motor carrier 
operations. From that one can estimate the relative benefits of crash reduction due to differing 
hours of service proposals.

H.3.3 Sleep Models 
Sleep models are used to analyze the major processes underlying sleep regulation. They also 
provide a conceptual framework for the analysis of sleep data. As pointed out in the sleep 
literature, sleep regulation involves three processes: (1) the homeostatic process 129 which 
increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep; (2) the circadian process which 
depends on the circadian oscillator controlling temperature and alertness rhythms; and (3) the 
ultradian process which determines the NREMIREM (Non RapidlRapid Eye Movement) 
periodicity. 130 
Over the past two decades, quantitative models have been developed to describe human sleep 
regulation. Most current mathematical models of alertness include a homeostatic component and 
circadian component. 131 Sleep models also account for the regulation of the alternation between 
non-REM sleep and REM sleep. In one class of models, an ultradian oscillator regulates the 
alternation of non-REM and REM sleep. In the second class of models the alternation between 
non-REM sleep and REM sleep is governed by homeostatic processes related to non-REM sleep 
and REM sleep itself. 132 
129 The homeostatic process is often referred to as Process S. The homeostatic process triggers an increase in the 
. demand for sleep after a period of prior wakefulness. It reflects the extent to which the need for sleep has been 
satisfied.

implications", Journal of Sleep Research 1996; 25: 122. 
120 
H.3.3.1 Variation among Models 
Sleep models differ on how the various components interact with each other. Some models 
assume an additive interaction between the circadian and homeostatic components of alertness 
while later studies provide evidence of a nonadditive interaction. 133 Jewett et al (1999)134 
developed mathematical models in which levels of subjective alertness and cognitive throughput 
are predicted by three components that interact with one another in a nonlinear manner. These 
components are: (1) a homeostatic component (H) that falls in a s-shaped manner during wake 
and increases at a decreasing rate that asymptotically approaches a maximum during sleep; (2) a 
circadian component (C); and (3) a sleep inertia component (W) that increases at a decreasing 
rate after awakening. 
Sleep models also vary depending on the model's purpose. More recently, efforts have been 
made to develop sleep models that can quantify the relationship between sleep; circadian rhythm 
and performance. The models use sleep data as input and they yield predicted alertness as well 
as performance on monotonous tasks. Some models include an identification of levels at which 
the risk of performance or alertness impairment starts, as well as prediction of sleep latency and 
time of awakening of sleep episodes. Examples of this new generation of sleep models include 
the following: the Fatigue Audit InterDyne model (FAID), the Circadian Alertness Simulator 
(CAS) and the Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model (WRAIR-SPM). 
H.3.3.2 Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model 
The Walter Reed Sleep and Performance Prediction Model (WRAIR-SPM) was conceived in the 
late 1980s by Colonel Gregory L. Belenky, US Army, and members of his research staff at the 
U.S. Army's Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). The WRAIR-SPM is a 
quantitative model that was initially designed to predict the performance of soldiers during 
extended operations.

performance", Journal of Sleep Research 1992, 1: 112117. 
34 Jewett, M.E., Kronauer, RE., (1999). Interactive mathematical models of SUbjective alertness and cognitive 
throughput in humans, Journal of Biological Rhythms 1999;14(6):588-97. 
121 
During the 1990's, WRAIR's sleep researchers refined the model based on data obtained from 
studies of sleep loss per se as a determinant of cognitive performance. They focused on the 
effects of total and partial sleep deprivation on a wide range of psychological and cognitive 
performance tests. The cognitive task performances selected from the WRAIR Performance 
Assessment Battery (PAB) include those that tap into brain functions representative of those 
involved in doing military command and control tasks (e.g., serial addition/subtraction, logical 
reasoning, choice reaction time and pattern recognition tasks). 
Further attempts to refine the model in the mid-1990s led to debates about whether expected 
performance decline during complete sleep deprivation periods were linear, or degraded in a 
step-wise function over time for successive days of military operations. The step-wise cognitive 
performance degradation function (Angus & Heslegrave, 1985)135 indicates that performance 
was relatively constant until about 18 hours of non-stop work which is similar but not the same 
as time-on-task). After 18 hours of non-stop work, performance drops by 25% from baseline, 
and remains at a constant level until about 30 hours of continuous work. At this point, it drops 
by another 15-20%, and subsequently begins to deteriorate to 30% of baseline over three days in 
sustained performance tasks. 
In order to extend and validate the parameters of the WRAIR-SPM, the FMCSA and other 
government agencies sponsored a large-scale laboratory confinement study to determine the 
effects of four sleep/wake schedules on alertness and performance. The Sleep Dose-Response 
study (SDR) examined the effects of one week's restricted sleep (three, five, seven, or nine hrs 
per night) on the performance of 66 CMV driver subjects. Multiple measures of performance, 
including psychomotor vigilance tasks (PVTs) and driving performance measures, were taken 
while drivers did a sequence of 45-minute drives on a low-fidelity desk-top truck driving 
simulator (Balkin, et aI., May 2000). This study resulted in numerical estimation of parameters 
for the WRAIR Sleep Performance Model, and elucidated the relationships among several sleep-
related performance measures. 
Prior to the sleep dose-response (SDR) simulator study by Balkin et aI., Belenky and the WRAIR 
135 Angus, R.G. & Heslegrave, R.J. (1985). Effects of sleep loss on sustained cognitive performance during a 
command and control simulation. Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers, Vol. 17, No.1, pp 55-67. 
122 
team originally based their prediction model (originally called SPM-96 and framed around only 
young healthy males) on its ability to predict a person's performance on the serial 
addition/subtraction task from the WRAIR-PAB (Thome et aI., 1985)136. The SDR truck 
simulator study added experience with a more diverse population of subjects. With this 
information, they refined the WRAIR-SPM model and they began to base the prediction 
algorithms around the Dinges Psychomotor Vigilance Task, a simple reaction time test (Balkin et 
aI., 2000). Generally, the PVT reaction time scores are used as indications of a secondary task 
measurement to indicate the level of "alertness" remaining, the reservoir of alertness still there in 
the subject while being subjected to continuous performance demands over time. 
After the SDR study with truck drivers in the simulator, the WR-SPM gradually became a four-
process model. The timing and duration of a person's sleep and wakefulness periods over 
several days constitutes a sleep/wake history. Four separate functions are used to relate 
sleep/wake history to level of cognitive performance capacity, including (a) a wake function, (b) 
a sleep function, (c) a "delay of recuperation" function, and (d) a sleep inertia function. 
Because the parameter values for the latest WRAIR-SPM were estimated using normalized 
Response Time on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task as the performance metric, and given the 
wide acceptability of PVTs as a "standard" by which many sleep deprivation and performance 
studies are measured, the next section will be devoted to describing the main features of the 
psychomotor vigilance task. 
H.3.3.3 Psychomotor Vigilance Task 
The Psychomotor Vigilance Task is a test of behavioral alertness developed by David Dinges 
and John Powell in the mid-1980s at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) Hospital. The 
PVT was designed to evaluate the ability to sustain attention and respond in a timely manner to 
salient signals (Dinges & Powell, 1985).137 It was also designed to be free of a learning curve or

655. 
123 
influence from acquired skills, such as aptitude or education, and to be highly sensitive to an 
attentional process that is fundamental to normal behavioral alertness. 
PVT performance has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to detecting changes in 
behavioral alertness associated with numerous work settings, such as medical house staff jobs, 
night shift workers, drowsy drivers, transoceanic pilots. PVT performance is also sensitive to 
bodily states, such as those of partial and total sleep-deprived subjects, truck drivers with sleep 
apnea, sleepy elderly subjects, and to exposure to various ingested chemical substances, such as 
caffeine, modafinil, and alcohol. 
In the study of operating practices in a high-fidelity truck simulator, O'Neill et al. (1999)138 
examined two weeks of day-time driving (0700-2130 hrs) that entailed simulated driving tests of 
12 hours per day on a 14 hours on duty and 10 hours off duty work schedule. Ten-minute PVT 
tests were administered three times per day (at 0645, 1330 and 2100 hrs) during a five-day 
driving workweek, and four times per day on the drivers' weekend off recovery days (0900, 
1300, 1700 and 2100 hrs). PVT data were reported in the form of median and mean reciprocal 
response times, and number of lapses, combined on a graph. The authors found that PVT scores 
were sensitive to partial and full sleep deprivation, thus underscoring the value of properly 
designed work-rest schedules. 
The PVT is acknowledged as being one of the most consistently reliable research tools for the 
study of operator alertness, fatigue and/or drowsiness. The PVT test of simple choice reaction 
time is backed by almost two decades of experience and historical data. It has been used widely 
by the research community in many studies e.g. Balkin, (2000)139; O'Neill et al. (1999); Hartley 
et aI., (2000)140 and Krueger, (2002).141

H.3.3.3.1 Model Calibration 
Balkin et al. (2000) described the WRAIR-SPM as "a series of empirically derived mathematical 
relationships describing the continuous decrement of cognitive performance during wakefulness, 
restoration of cognitive performance during sleep, and cyclic variation in cognitive performance 
during the course of the day." 
Wakefulness was assumed to diminish cognitive performance capacity by a simple linear decay 
function Ct = Ct-1 - KW, where Ct is the cognitive performance capacity at time t, and KW is the 
performance depletion occurring in the interval t-1 to t. 
Sleep was assumed to restore cognitive capacity utilizing an exponential growth function. For a 
subject going to sleep once cognitive capacity reached zero and remaining asleep for a period of 
time t, cognitive capacity would equal 100 * (1 - e_c2*t).142 In this representation, the coefficient 
c2 is the sleep recovery time constant. 
The third component of the model is the circadian phase modulating function (M) which has 
both a circadian (24-hour) and ultradian (l2-hour) component. To reflect the 24-hour circadian 
and 12-hour ultradian components, M is expressed as an additive double cosine function: 
M = 1 + C3 * cos ((2n/ 24) * t + C4) + Cs * cos ((2n/ 12) * t + C6)143 
where c3 and c5 represent the amplitude parameters for the cosine functions c4 and c6 represent 
phase shift parameters from midnight (the beginning of a day). In the WRAIR-SPM, predicted 
performance at a given time (t) is expressed as the product of the Current Cognitive Capacity (C) 
and the Modulating function (M). 
H.3.3.3.2 Inputs 
The software model enables users to enter sleep/wake schedules in which the subject follows the 
142 FMCSA, "The effects of sleep schedules on commercial motor vehicle driver performance", May 2000. pp. 3-9. 
143 Ibid. 
125 
exact same pattern over a period, or to enter a schedule where the subject's sleep pattern varies 
from day-to-day. The model has the capacity to evaluate schedules that cover up to 100 days. 
The following are the major input components to the WRAIR -SPM model. 
H.3.3.3.3 Sleep/Wake History 
The first major input to the model is sleep/wake history. The sleep/wake history represents the 
timing and duration of sleep and wakefulness periods over a period of days. In the WRAIR-
SPM, four functions are used to relate sleep/wake history to cognitive performance capacity level 
(CPCL). These four functions, and a brief description of their relationship to cognitive 
performance are as follows: 
WakelDecrement Function - The wake/decrement function describes how cognitive 
performance declines during periods of continuous wakefulness. 
SleeplRestoration Function - The sleep/restoration function describes the rate at which 
cognitive performance capacity accrues during sleep. 
Delay-of-Recuperation Function - The delay-of-recuperation function was incorporated 
into the model to exhibit the time lag between the wake/decrement function and the 
sleep/restoration function at the beginning of sleep. This delay is set at five minutes 
in the model, the time assumed to transition into recuperative sleep. 
Sleep Inertia Function - The sleep inertia function accounts for the gradual restoration of 
normal performance and alertness upon awakening (approximately 20 minutes). 
H.3.3.3.4 Time of Day (Circadian Phase) 
The second input is the circadian phase, which is based on time of day. This component 
accounts for the empirical data showing that CPCL oscillates between a five and twenty percent 
peak to trough over a 24-hour period. Reflecting the influence of circadian and ultradian 
rhythms on performance, performance is lowest in early morning hours, and increases across the 
day (except for a dip in the afternoon), and peaks in the evening hours, prior to sleep onset. 
H.3.3.3.5 Output 
Based on the user input of a sleep/wake schedule, the model will generate graphical and tabular 
126 
outputs. The tabular data presents minute-by-minute reports of the subject's sleep/wake status at 
the particular time and level of predicted performance. The level of predicted performance is 
reported numerically on a scale ranging from zero (0) to one hundred (100). 
H.3.3.3.6 Model Limitations 
The model does not differentiate between "awake and working" versus "awake and resting" 
times. One might think that the former would take a greater toll on one's performance level 
capacity for subsequent periods in the day. In addition, it does not explicitly take into account 
the interaction of physical and mental exhaustion and it does not recognize any time-on-task 
effects separate from the general cognitive depletion and circadian functions. 
H.3.4 Estimating Sleep Profiles 
The modeling uses actigraph data from the Walter Reed field study to predict sleep in a 24-hour 
period based on time on duty in 24 hours. The WaIter Reed field study provides the most 
accurate measure of actual sleep (rather than reported sleep) as well as its relationship to time 
worked. Because the dataset follows a panel of people across time, the appropriate model is a 
random-effects cross-sectional time series model for panel datasets. 144 Diagnostic tests indicate 
the appropriateness of a random effects model. 145 
The data suggest the most appropriate functional form is a cubic regression equation (third-order 
polynomial), particularly given the interest in accurately reflecting hours of sleep for those 
working longer hours. 146 This relationship between time sleeping and time on-duty is then used 
144 Theory suggests that the individual differences are random disturbances drawn from some general distribution 
rather than that each person has a fixed effect shifting the equation up or down, that is, residuals do not vary by 
individual. In order to run the model appropriately, it was assumed that all days are sequential even if one day's 
observation was missing or was dropped due data problems. 
145 A Hausman test did not reject the null model that the fixed and random effects models are equivalent at a 5 
percent alpha level, although it did at a 10 percent level. The coefficients and standard errors found using the 
random effects model, however, differ only slightly from either using a fixed effects model or pooling the dataset 
(coefficients only) as if the data points were all independent individuals. This indicates that misspecification is not 
likely to have affected results. For instance, the fixed effect regression equation results in predictions for sleep vary 
by no more than five minutes from the random effects model. 
146 The data show non-linear tendencies, and a quadratic equation provides predictions that fall out of the realm of 
that possible (more than 24 hours of activity per day) for people who report a large number of hours on duty.

Total Hours On Duty in 24 Hours 
Because of the interest in this study of accurately reflecting schedules for people who work a large number of hours, 
the functional form is cubic so that it more closely matches the data especially if a driver is modeled as having 
worked a large number of hours. The equation estimated is y = 8.12800 - 0.18272 x + 0.02335x2 - 0.00138x3โข The 
R-square is reasonable given the number of data points available. 
147 FMCSA attempted to compare the relationship between hours of sleep and time on-duty found from the Walter 
Reed Field Study with that found from the two waves of the UMTIP data. It was expected that the relationship 
would be larger for UMTIP because it provides self-reported time sleeping rather than actiwatch monitoring of 
actual sleep. Another qualification is that the UMTIP did not require drivers to verify time on duty by logging on 
duty periods or referring to their log books. Because there were problems with the accuracy of the UMTIP data, 
they were used only as a check on the magnitude of predicted difference in hours slept due to different hours on 
duty. A regression using these data produces less reliable estimates, with a slope rising from eight hours of sleep in 
the last 24 with zero hours on duty to over 9.5 hours of sleep when working six hours in the last 24. The downward 
slope for hours worked above ten was somewhat steeper than that resulting from the Walter Reed data.

H.3.5 Estimating Change in SH Crashes using Model Schedules 
Daily schedules were modeled for SH drivers to input into the Sleep Performance spreadsheet to 
predict differences in incremental crash risks for a baseline with full nights of sleep, actual 
compliance with current HOS rules, current HOS rules under full compliance, and the three 
proposed options. Research on schedules for SH drivers is more limited than for LH drivers. 
The literature indicates that these schedules are noted for their more regular pattern of work even 
if length of the work day varies 
Daily schedules for SH drivers were modeled using information on typical SH schedules from 
the Virginia Tech Field Study and Virginia Tech Focus Groups. General lessons from these 
sources were confirmed with industry representatives involved in SH operations. Column 2 of 
Virginia Tech Focus Groups' table 4 (p. 8) outlines typical daily patterns for local beverage truck 
drivers. The general pattern begins with an early start to the work-day beginning with pre-trip 
inspections and paperwork. The trip to the first delivery stop is about 15 to 30 miles followed by 
delivery and paperwork activities. This is followed by a series of shorter driving times (about 
three miles according to the table) among subsequent route stops and delivery and paperwork 
activities of roughly constant length. The route ends with a trip back to the facility followed by 
assisting in reloading or paperwork. The Virginia Tech Focus Groups' table 14 (p. 77) lists 
average number of deliveries for beverage and snack delivery drivers as just over 11 per day. 
Figure 25 in the Virginia Tech Focus Groups (p. 75) indicates that the average SH driver in the 
focus groups spent 29 percent of their non-break time driving. 148 
All SH drivers are modeled as arriving at work at 7:00 am, the median response to time of day 
they start work. They are modeled as having awoken a half-hour before arriving at work. 
Sensitivity tests indicated that modeling the drivers as arriving at work 75 minutes after 
awakening made minimal differences. Following the information discussed above, SH drivers 
are modeled as performing non-driving work for their first half hour on duty, followed by a half 
148 This indicates that the driving hours limitations in the 2003 rules would not constrain SH drivers. This average 
response of 29 percent of a work-day spent driving is somewhat less than that suggested by the Virginia Tech Field 
Study question asking "What percentage of work time is driving?" The modal response in the field study was 50% 
(answers were restricted to <50%, 50%, >50%, 100%.) 
129 
hour of driving to arrive at their first delivery stop and a half-hour of non-driving work at the 
first stop.149 Drivers' last half hour is modeled as non-driving work. For the remaining hours 
on-duty for SH drivers, time is modeled as a repeating pattern of alternating deliveries such that 
even numbered deliveries begins with a quarter-hour of driving followed by three-quarters of an 
hour of non-driving work and odd deliveries begins with a quarter-hour of driving followed by a 
half-hour of non-driving work. These lengths were chosen such that SH drivers drive just over 
30 percent of the day for average workdays of 10.3 hours in length. 150 Because FMCSA is 
interested primarily in the differences in crash risk among the proposals, the exact number of 
deliveries or length of time spent on each aspect of a driver's duties is less important than the 
even distribution of driving throughout the day. 
This general pattern of daily schedules is applied to 25-day schedules. 151 The series of schedules 
are adapted such that the SH drivers do not work on the sixth and seventh day of the week to 
reflect the typical regular work week schedules found in the industry. 152 For a given night, the 
amount of sleep is modeled based on the calculated relationship between sleep and time on-
duty.153 Sleep was modeled for SH drivers as ending a half-hour before leaving for work. The 
time sleep begins varies according to the amount of total time (within a quarter hour) of 
estimated sleep. A 25-day working schedule was input from every fourth driver into the Sleep 
Performance spreadsheet for each of the proposal options as well as for the current compliance 
level. The schedules for each proposal vary only by the threshold at which individual work days 
are truncated. 154 The resulting incremental crash incidence calculation for each scenario is 
subtracted from a baseline crash increment. This baseline increment represents the model's 
estimated crash risk increment from five-day work week schedules of 8 hours of sleep with 
149 These time lengths were based partially on the approximate number of miles driving for each segment in 
Appendix J divided by 20 mph speeds in city between deliveries and by 40 mph from the terminal to the first stop. 
150 This is the average length of work day according to the Virginia Tech Field Study and the average length of 
work day modeled under current compliance levels. The Virginia Tech Focus Group drivers provide a slightly 
longer average shift length of 10.89 hours. 
151 This is done by inputting the daily driving schedule pattern as an equation conditional on length of day and 
varying the 25-day schedule as an input. 
152 Representatives involved in the SH industry indicated that most SH operations are based on a regular five-day 
work week. Similarly, the majority of local pick-up and delivery respondents in the UMTIP survey indicated they 
worked five-days in the past seven day pay period. 
153 There was no evidence found that the relationship between amount of sleep nightly and number of hours on 
duty should vary between LH and SH drivers. 
154 Additional drivers are not modeled explicitly under the simplifying assumption that replacement drivers will 
work and drive similar day lengths as the dataset average. 
130 
driving spread throughout the day. ISS Given the assumptions in the baseline, the model provides 
a baseline crash increment of -1.72 percent, just slightly below the a percent expected 
theoretically. Because this baseline is subtracted from the increment for the 2003 rules, its size 
does not affect the results, which are presented at the end of the following section. 
H.3.6 LH Schedule Models 
H.3.6.1 Spreadsheet LH Crash Increment Calculations 
After generating each rolling and non-rolling schedule modeled for each driver proportion cell, 
FMCSA calculated crash risk increments by entering the schedules into the SleeplPerformance

H.3.6.2 Weighting Crash Increments, Productivity and Proportion Fatigue-Related 
The crash risk increments calculated above are multiplied by the percentage of drivers found in 
each cell in the driver schedule proportion matrices. The resulting value is subtracted from the 
baseline crash increment under schedules with eight hours of regular sleep for an interim crash 
increment score for the pre-2003 compliance status quo, pre-2003 rule with full compliance, and 
2003 rule with full compliance. 
These interim crash increments are adjusted for the differences in productivity found through 
155 Driving is spread throughout the day in order to get an appropriate baseline that reflects an average of any time 
of day driving. 
131 
these calculations from the productivity found in generating the cost estimates. Crash risk 
estimates are scaled up or down using the ratio of productivity found in the cost analysis to that 
found in the crash risk analysis. The results are multiplied by the proportion of truck crashes in 
which fatigue may have played a role. Only truck crashes in which truck driver fatigue is 
considered to have potentially played a role are included in this proportion. The productivity 
adjustments and the raw fatigue-related crash increments calculated across all cells in a driver 
proportion matrix are shown in table 62. 
Table 62: Raw LH Crash Increment and Productivity Adjustment 
Raw Crash Increment Productivity 
Scenario vs Baseline Adjustment Factor 
Pre 2003 Status Quo 11.5% 0.0% 
Pre 2003, Fully Enforced 8.4% 5.7% 
2003 Rules 7.0% 0.0% 
The final step discussed in this section is to convert the raw crash increment into the percentage 
of crashes that are related to fatigue, starting with the incremental crashes for each option that 
occur due to fatigue (raw fatigue increment). This number does not represent fatigue-related 
crashes as a proportion of all crashes, which ultimately is the proportion of interest. To calculate 
this proportion, termed the fatigue-related percentage, the raw fatigue increment is divided by the 
sum of the fatigue increment and the baseline of crashes before the fatigue increment. The 
baseline percentage of crashes before adding the fatigue increment is simply 100 percent. The 
sum of the raw fatigue increment plus the baseline percentage of total crashes is the raw fatigue 
increment plus 100 percent. The percentage of fatigue-related crashes, therefore, is the raw crash 
increments divided by 100 percent plus the raw crash increment or (raw increment)/(lOO percent 
+ raw increment). 156 
For the pre 2003 status quo scenario, the raw crash increment of 11.5 percent is divided by 100 
percent plus 11.5 percent or 11.5 percent 1(100 percent + 11.5 percent) = 10.3 percent. The result 
156 As an example for clarification, suppose for the status quo that the fatigue increment were 100 percent. That is, 
in this hypothetical example, fatigue causes as many crashes in the status quo as would occur without driving under 
fatigued conditions. Fatigue, however, would not cause 100 percent of all crashes - only half. This percentage is 
calculated by dividing 100 percent by 100 percent + 100 percent, or 100 percent/200 percent = 50 percent. 
132 
of these calculations are shown in table 63, which also presents the equivalent fatigue-related 
crash results from the analysis of SH operations described above.

H.3.6.3 Calibration of SP Results to Empirical Fatigue Crash Estimates 
Because the SP spreadsheet is based on predictions of changes in simulated crashes rather than 
real-world experience, it cannot be used directly to estimate the percentage of crashes 
attributable to fatigue. Instead, that percentage was estimated independently. To ensure that 
they map well to the real world, the spreadsheet results need to be adjusted so that the scenario 
representing the status quo corresponds to this independent estimate of fatigue-related crashes. 
The SP spreadsheet projected the fatigue-related crash percentage (relative to what would be 
expected for non-fatigued drivers) of 10.3 percent for LH operations and 3.6 percent for SH 
operations. The percentage of fatigue-related crashes is projected to be just under three times as 
great for LH as for SH operations. This difference is not surprising, given that SH drivers are 
much more likely than LH drivers to work during the day, sleep at home at night, and are less 
likely to be pushed to work extremely long hours. Previous research supports this general 
conclusion. For trucks on trips of 500 miles or more, the relative risk is even higher, at 2.35.,,157 
LH operations account for 61.8 percent of fatal truck crashes, 55 percent of injury-only truck 
157 Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation and Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis, Hours of Service NPRM, Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration, April 2000, p. 28. 
133 
crashes, and 59 percent of property-damage only crashes. Weighting by the number of crashes 
in each category, it was found that LH operations accounted for 58.2 percent of all crashes, with 
SH operations accounting for the remaining 41.8 percent. Fatigue accounted for 8.15 percent of 
all fatal truck crashes. Combining these percentages with the SP spreadsheet results showing 
fatigue-related increments of 3.6 percent and 10.3 percent for SH and LH operations respectively 
indicates that all of the estimates can be reconciled if the SP spreadsheet estimates are multiplied 
by an appropriate factor. This factor was found by setting up the following equation for X, the 
factor by which the SP spreadsheet estimates are to be multiplied: 
41.8% * 3.6% * X + 58.2% * 10.3% * X = 8.15% 
Rearranging terms and solving, X = 8.15%/(41.8%*3.6%+58.2%*10.3%) 
= 8.15%/7.45% = 1.0917. 
Thus, the SP spreadsheet can be calibrated to yield the 8.15% overall fatigue-related crash risk if 
the SP spreadsheet estimates of the crash increments are multiplied by 1.0917, producing 
fatigue-related increments of 3.9 and 11.2 percent for SH and LH respectively. Calibrating the 
estimates of the percentage of fatigue-related crashes for all of the options by multiplying by 
1.0917 results in the estimates presented in table 64.

H.3.7 Risks Associated with New Drivers 
A secondary impact of the proposed HOS options would be to change the number of relatively 
inexperienced drivers that operate in the trucking industry. Since there is evidence in the 
literature linking experience with accident rates, any changes in the number of inexperienced 
drivers would correspondingly change the overall accident rates for all drivers under the HOS 
134 
options considered. 
Calculations for the changes in crash rates for new drivers were performed using data from the 
UMTIP driver survey and the discrete time proportional crash hazards model estimated for 
drivers based on that data. 158 Using the regression coefficients for experience and its squared 
term from that model, and data on driving experience from Abrams, et al. (1997),159 a crash risk 
as a function of driving experience was estimated. Chart 6 shows that relationship.

The function above indicates a 28 percent average reduction in crash risk for existing drivers 
over their lifetime of driving. Given the coefficients on years of experience and its squared term, 
FMCSA also estimated a lO-year weighted average change in accident rates for new drivers. 
The lO-year time horizon was chosen to be consistent with the time period used in this analysis 
for the costs and benefits calculations. 
158 See Michael Belzer, et al. "Pay for Safety: An Economic Alternative for Truck Driver Safety", FMCSA, 
January 2002. 
159 See C. Abrams, T. Schultz, CD. Wylie. "Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Fatigue, Alertness, and 
Countermeasures Survey." Sponsored by U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 
August 1997. 
135 
The weights used for this calculation are based on the distribution of experience levels for new 
drivers. According to conversations with industry analysts, approximately 85 percent of new 
drivers come in without any driving experience outside of their training and the remaining 15 
percent is estimated to have an average 4 years of driving experience. 
There is evidence that suggests that the high turnover rates, especially in the TL segment, have 
been driven by the nature of tfi'e hours of service,160 among other factors. Conversations with 
industry experts on driver retention suggest that the proposed new rules could have a positive 
impact on turnover to the extent that they make the work schedules in this profession similar to 
some of the other blue-collar occupations. Experts also feel that the industry does not have 
adequate human resource programs to retain drivers, leading to the highest turnover rates within 
the first 12 months of tenure. If HOS compliance could bring about any reductions in drivers 
leaving trucking, it could reduce the need for hiring new inexperienced drivers 161 and change the 
composition of the new driver pool such that it is on average more experienced. Moreover, 
according to some industry experts, there is a growing tendency among trucking companies to 
only hire new drivers with some experience. This trend can also increase the average level of 
experience for the new drivers, as well as change the composition of drivers with or without 
experience in the analysis. Because data are not available on reduction in turnover because of 
the proposed new rules or fraction of the companies that only hire new drivers with some 
experience, FMCSA looked at a case in which only 50 percent of the new drivers come in with 
no experience and the rest with 4 years of experience. The Agency also looked at an extreme 
case where 99 percent of the new drivers have no experience. The results of this analysis are 
presented in table 65. 
160 See Gallup Organization study: "Empty Seats and Musical Chairs: Critical Success Factors in Truck Driver 
Retention", 1997, and discussion of these issues in detail in Chapter 6. 
161 What is also worth mentioning is that tenure seems to be a bigger problem for TL companies, more than 
inexperience. Driver retention rates are very low and improving HOS can have a positive impact on that.

Note that negative crash risk percentages imply that in that market segment, there is actually a 
reduction in overall crash risk because of a decrease in labor demand (or increase in labor 
productivity) from the HOS rules. 
The main conclusion from the table given above is that although the Agency did not expect an 
increase in crash rates if there is a need to hire new drivers, the relative increases in their crash 
risk probabilities are not that alarming. The table also suggests that the increase in crash rates for 
new drivers is not very sensitive to the composition of experience levels for new drivers, in that 
the changes in crash risks from the top row of the table to the bottom are generally much smaller 
than one percentage point whereas the risk reductions provided by the options are on the order of 
several percent. This analysis used row 2, the 85 percent - 15 percent division, to calculate the 
changes in dollar benefits. 
H.3.8 Value of Crash Reductions 
The total damages from all large truck crashes can be found by mUltiplying the total number of 
crashes by the average damage imposed per large truck crash. The average value of damages per 
crash shown in table 66, $75,637, is based on research for the Department of Transportation. 162 
Multiplied together, the total number of crashes and the value of damages per crash yield total 
annual damages of over $32 billion.

This total value of damages can be divided between LH and SH operations using the breakdowns 
of crashes by length-of-haul and severity. Dividing the total number of crashes of each severity 
level into LH and SH yields the total number of crashes for each length of haul. Multiplying 
these totals by the average value per crash yields an approximate value of damages from all LH 
and SH crashes. These estimates are only approximate because the damages per crash differ by 
crash severity, and the breakdown of crashes by length of haul differs according to the severity 
of the crash. 
The last line of table 67 shows the effect of excluding two groups of LH drivers from the 
calculation of benefits. It is not expected that drivers in these two relatively small groups - team 
drivers (for both private fleets and for-hire carriers) and the LH drivers in LTL carriers - to have 
their work schedules significantly affected by changes in the HOS rules. The changes in fatigue-
related crashes estimated to result from the options would not apply to these drivers or to the 
crashes that involve them. The damage estimates for LH crashes are reduced by 14.6 percent, 
which is the estimate of the percentage of LH VMT accounted for by these drivers.

The direct costs relative to the status quo are shown in table 70. This table shows the costs of the 
current rules with full compliance in the fourth column from the right. Because there would be 
costs for compliance with the pre-2003 rules, the costs of the current rules are higher relative to 
the status quo than relative to the pre-2003 rule with full compliance.

H.5 Changes to Cost and Benefit Calculations from the 2005 HOS RIA 
In the 2005, HOS rule, FMCSA changed the regulations to constrain the use of sleeper berths to 
ensure that each sleeper berth period is at least 8 hours, and is supplemented by a 2-hour break: 
that may be outside the sleeper berth. At that time, the Agency also implemented an exemption 
from maintaining RODS for certain SH operations, which generates an ongoing paperwork 
savings. However, compliance costs and safety benefits to SH were unaffected. 
H.5.1 Work Patterns 
Patterns of working by drivers in the different sectors of the trucking industry for the basis for 
the 2005 HOS rule analysis. In particular, the analysis focused on intensity of effort; this may be 
thought of as the degree to which drivers work close to the limits imposed by the HOS rules. 
This can refer to hours worked (on-duty hours) in a week and in a day, hours driven in a day, 
days worked and days off in a week. These measures are important for analysis of both 
productivity and safety effects of rule changes. 
H.5.1.1 Data Sources 
The measures of work patterns and intensity were based on several data sources. There were four 
sets of data on current experience (under the 2003 HOS rule): data provided by Schneider 
National on some aspects of its operations; data from the Owner Operator Independent Drivers 
Association (OOIDA) based on a survey of its members; a survey of private carriers carried out 
by Professor Stephen Burks of the University of Minnesota; and data collected by FMCSA (the 
"field survey"). The Schneider, OOIDA, and Burks data were gathered with the express purpose 
of obtaining information on use of three aspects of the new rule: the 11th hour, restarts, and split 
sleeper periods. Each of these sources is focused on a different sector of the industry. 
In addition to the above data, information was used from nine private interviews with carriers, 
eight small TL firms and one small L TL firm. 
H.5.1.1.1 Schneider 
141 
Schneider's data are for a large TL firm and cover approximately 16,000 drivers. They were 
taken from company records for August and October of 2004. 
H.5.1.1.2 OOIDA 
OOIDA data are based on owner-operators and a few company drivers for TL firms. OOIDA 
posted a survey form on its website asking drivers for information on use of the 2003 rule 
provisions in June 2004. The data used here are based on responses from 1,223 drivers. 
H.5.1.1.3 Burks 
Professor Burks mailed a survey form to private carriers asking for information on their drivers' 
use of the new-rule features in June 2004. He received usable responses from 29 firms covering 
3,311 drivers. 
H.5.1.1.4 FMCSA Field Survey 
The field-survey data largely represent company drivers with small TL companies. In terms of 
distribution of company size, this makes sense; the most TL companies are quite small. In the 
field survey, 86 percent of for-hire, TLlOTR companies have fewer than 25 tractors. Viewed in 
terms of truckload company size, the field survey is a representative sample, but these small 
companies account for a faid y small share of TLlOTR VMT, about 17 percent. L TL firms and 
private carriers are sparsely represented in the field survey. 
These data, based on drivers' log books, were obtained from compames III the course of 
compliance reviews or safety audits. Data cover 542 drivers with 269 firms in the period July 
2004 to January 2005. For each driver, data for one month of operation were collected. 
H.5.1.2 Average Hours Per Day-On-Duty and Driving 
Two basic measures of work are daily hours of driving and total work, the latter term including 
all on-duty time, both driving and other work. The field survey and the Schneider data provide 
142 
information on driving time per tour; only the field survey provides data on on-duty hours per 
tour. The field survey provides some information on local drivers; the Schneider data do not 
distinguish between local and OTR operations. 
A basic assumption in the calculation is that a day is equivalent to a tour of duty. While there are 
exceptions, most drivers work one shift in a day. A tour of duty comprises the time from the 
driver's start of work to end of work, including driving, other on-duty, and off-duty time. Results 
are in table 74. That the numbers for driving hours for Schneider and OTR drivers from the field 
survey are so close enhances confidence in these numbers, even though the Schneider data 
include local service along with OTR operation. 
Table 74: Daily driving and on-duty hours-averages 
Field Survey Schneider 
Driving 7.7 7.6 
On-duty 9.2 N/A 
H.5.1.3 Average Hours and Days of Work Per Week 
For OTR drivers, a typical measure of work is number of hours in eight days, which shows how 
close drivers work to the 70-hour limit for eight days. A more complete understanding of 
drivers' work patterns, though, is revealed by examining data on days worked per week. Both 
the field survey and the Schneider data give hours worked in eight days, 62 hours for Schneider 
drivers, 59 hours for field-survey drivers. 163 Some intermediate steps are required to convert 
these numbers to days per week. They are first divided them by 9.2, the field survey figure for 
on-duty hours per tour of duty, to obtain days worked per eight days and then make a further 
adjustment to obtain days worked per seven days. These results are presented in table 75. 
163 For both data sources, the analysis discarded all drivers with fewer than 50 hours of work in eight days on the 
grounds that they were not driving full-time in the period covered. 
143

Days worked per week 5.6 5.9 
H.5.1.4 Intensity of Effort 
Examining only the average hours of driving and hours and days of work might lead one to 
conclude that all drivers work well within the limits imposed by the HOS rules. Many drivers 
work and drive longer hours than the averages, and this analysis relies on the percentages of 
drivers that work close to the limits for estimating productivity and safety effects. The following 
show the distributions of daily driving and on-duty hours and on-duty hours in 8-day periods.

The OOIDA survey asked for frequency of use of the 11th hour but did not otherwise ask about driving hours. The 
figure presented here was calculated from the underlying survey data. 
It is worth noting that the on-duty hours show a pattern relative to the 14-hour limit different 
from that of the driving hours relative to the II-hour limit. Drivers are driving ten or more hours 
in more than 25.0 percent of their work days while reporting 13 or more on-duty hours for only 
8.0 percent of days. The latter number suggests that drivers are generally taking two hours of 
break in a 14-hour tour or their normal work shifts are shorter than 14 hours. The Agency 
suspects that both are true. Inaccurate logging of on-duty hours could also be a factor.

Tables 77 and 78 show that, while daily on-duty hours tend to "bunch" away from the limit, 
multi-day on-duty hours bunch close to the limit, closer, indeed, than is the case for driving 
hours. Tables 76 and 78 give information on differences in behavior between company drivers 
and owner-operators. While driving hours show a marked difference, the difference in multi-day 
hours is slight. Some of this could be accounted for by the fact that OOrDA data include some 
owner-operators working on their own authority; those in the Schneider data are all leased. 
Regarding differences in the average driving hours listed in table 79, it should be noted that there 
are few owner-operators in the field-survey data; the higher percentage of 11 th -hour use from the 
field survey, as compared with Schneider, suggests that smaller companies may push harder than 
larger ones, insofar as the driving limit is concerned. The OOrDA data on the 11th hour could be 
seen as part of such a pattern, especially if one thinks the own-authority owner-operators are 
using the 11th hour heavily. However, the multi-day hours show the reverse pattern. For 65.0 
percent of reported instances, Schneider's drivers have over 59 hours; from the field survey, the 
comparable number is 43.0 percent. This might suggest that a big company does not schedule as 
close to the driving limits as a smaller company might but enjoys greater success in marketing 
and, thus, is able to keep its drivers moving more consistently. There could, of course, be other 
145 
explanations. 
One must be wary of reaching too far in drawing inferences from these data. To the extent that 
data from different sources show consistent patterns, one can use this information in analysis 
with some confidence. One pattern that comes through consistently is that the preponderance of 
OTR drivers and trucking firms are not operating at, or close to, the HaS limits. Approximately 
25 to 30 percent of drivers are driving more than nine hours regularly and 25 to 40 percent of 
drivers are regularly working more than 64 hours in eight days. The industry experts consulted 
for this analysis agreed that this is an accurate general view of industry operations. 
H.5.2 Use of New Provisions of the 2003 HaS Rule 
The analysis examined the use of three aspects of the 2003 rule: restarts, the 11th hour, and the 
split sleeper-berth provision. The data come from the sources already mentioned: Schneider, 
OOIDA, Burks, and the FMCSA field survey. 
H.5.2.1 Restarts 
All four of data sources reported on use of restarts. OOIDA reported that almost 90 percent of 
drivers used the restart at least some of the time. l64 Burks reported that private carrier drivers 
used the restart on 61.0 percent of their runs. 165 Neither OOIDA nor Burks, however, reported on 
length of restarts. 
A driver using the restart provision may not be taking only the minimum 34 hours for the restart 
period. Schneider and the field survey both reported a high level of use of restarts and gave 
information on the length of restarts. In Schneider's data, only 2.0 percent of restarts were only 
34 hours. Depending on the reporting period, one-quarter to one-third of the restarts were 44 
hours or fewer. Forty-three percent were 58 hours or fewer. Schneider showed a bi-modal 
distribution with peaks at 39 and 62 hours. Presumably, the former reflects cases in which the

Service Features,'" OOIDA Foundation, September 15,2004.

146 
driver has taken one full day off, plus a few hours from the preceding and following days; the 
latter would reflect two full days off. The field survey shows that 33.0 percent of restarts were 
44 hours or fewer. This comports well with the Schneider data. On this basis, one can say that at 
least one-third of restarts are short enough to bring a productivity gain. Using the alternative 
method of the moving eight-day period, drivers would usually have to stay off more than 44 
hours before returning to work. 
Anecdotal information on company attitudes towards restarts is that they like the provision and 
find some productivity gain even though drivers are staying off more than 34 hours. Managers 
seem hesitant to demand a return to work after 34 hours, except in unusual situations. It may, of 
course, be the case that taking only 34 hours off would not fit with the work schedule of many 
drivers, that is, there would not be anything for them to do at the 35th hour. For example, the 35th 
hour might come at 3:00 AM, and the company might have no use for the driver until 8:00 AM. 
When a TL driver comes off his restart, his first task is to pick up a new load; the hour at which 
the company needs his services will be set by the requirements of the shipper of that first load. 
H.5.2.2 Split Sleeper Berths 
Data clearly indicate that most drivers never split, and those that do do so only occasionally. 
Schneider data for October 2004 show 97 percent of drivers never splitting and only 0.4 percent 
splitting "regularly." Before the new rule, Schneider did not allow solo drivers to split at all and 
has only allowed them to split on an 8-and-2 basis under the new rule. The data from OOIDA 
and the field survey show many more drivers splitting occasionally but few splitting frequently. 
Table 79: Incidence of Splitting 
Splitting frequency Field Survey OOIDA 
o times per month 66% 55% 
1-4 times per month 20% 20% 
0-4 times per month (sum of above rows) 86% 75% 
Average percent splitting per day 6% 13% 
The Burks data show a higher percentage of frequent splitting, although they are not directly 
147 
comparable with those from the field survey and OOIDA. They suggest that 52.0 percent of 
drivers split four or fewer times a month with the rest splitting more frequently. It is not clear 
why private drivers would split more frequently than others. There might be a higher percentage 
of teams in Burks's data; evidence suggests that teams split more frequently than solo drivers. 166 
The data in the following table come from an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 
survey of drivers at weigh stations in Pennsylvania and Oregon and from FMCSA's Driver 
Fatigue, Alertness and Countermeasures Study (DF ACS). 
The IIHS and DFACS findings agree that teams split more than solo drivers. There is some 
anecdotal evidence that the incidence of splitting by teams is higher than that found by IIHS and 
DFACS. Several comments to the HOS rule docket suggested higher percentages than these and 
also indicated that team splitting is generally balanced; that is, sleeper periods and driving stints 
are about equal at four to six hours each. 167 The IIHSIDFACS findings for solo drivers 
sometimes splitting are lower than those from OOIDA and the field survey. 
Table 80: Incidence of Splitting-Team and Solo 
IIHS DFACS 
Solo 24% 22% 
Team 47% 52% 
Data on splitting clearly show that splitting for most solo drivers occurs on an occasional and 
opportunistic basis. They do not build splitting into their operating routines. When they do take a 
split period in the sleeper, they go right back to the ten-hour rest at the next rest period. This does 
suggest that most drivers find the limited rest period unsatisfactory and use it only to avoid some 
other problem. An unexpected period of congestion would be one example. However, routine 
splitting is probably part of the daily operation of many teams. 
166 There is also some ambiguity in the Burks survey which asked for the percentage of "runs" using the splitting 
rule but did not define runs. It appears that some respondents interpreted "run" to be a multi-day period. The field 
survey data contained cases in which drivers reported splitting, though one of the "split" r.est periods exceeded ten 
hours. These cases were discarded, but this shows the danger of inaccurate logging of split sleeper periods.

H.5.2.3 The 11 th Hour

Field-survey numbers for compliant drivers only. Burks data might overstate 11 th hour use because drivers reported 
11 th hour use for "runs," which may encompass an entire trip spanning mUltiple work days. 
Data show that the 11th hour is definitely being used. Comparing Schneider data to OOIDA and 
the field survey implies that big companies use it less often than small companies or owner-
operators. The analysis uses the assumption that usage is heavier for smaller firms and sets 25 
tractors as the demarcation point between big and small TL companies. FMCSA estimates that 
40 percent of TL VMT is from small companies and 60 percent is from large companies. 
H.5.3 Carrier Operation Simulations 
In the simulation model used to assess impacts on the more complex types of carrier operations, 
a truck's progress is tracked in a computer program as the driver moves between origin and 
destination points, choosing new loads at the end of each run from a set of choices randomly 
selected from a data base representative of inter-county shipment patterns. The driver's choices 
are made on the basis of which loads feasibly can be picked up and delivered within specified 
windows, given the limits imposed by the need to stop and rest. Within feasible choices, the 
driver is assumed to choose (or be assigned) the load that is most advantageous in terms of its 
contribution to its productivity. Because the HOS rules affect which loads can be delivered, and 
change the amount of time that can be devoted to driving, the model is able to estimate impacts 
on productivity, and the accompanying changes in typical schedules.

The model starts at the user defined home terminal. Out of 20 randomly generated origin-
destination pairs, it chooses the pair that b~st fits its schedule as well as maximizes its 
productivity. Then it moves to the origin terminal, waits until the pick-up window time, and 
loads the shipment. It then drives to the destination terminal, waits until the delivery window 
time, and unloads the shipment. At this point, the model again analyzes another set of 20 origin-
destination pairs and repeats the same procedure prescribed above for the time duration defined 
by the user. The movement of the truck in the model is constrained by HOS rules (i.e., all 
required rest periods) allowing the user to compare different facets of HOS rules with 
assumption of full compliance. 
At the end of the simulation, the model yields an output that shows how the CMV operator 
behaved at each time of day. The truck's movement following the operation cycle is recorded in 
the schedule output table which reveals what the truck was doing at each time of the day each 
day during the whole simulation duration. The duration of simulation is defined by the user so 
the model can generate up to one year's worth of the schedule table. Table 82 is a snapshot of 
150 
the schedule table showing only a small portion of it. The table actually has over 40 columns 
providing details such as time of the day, day of the week, driving status, load status, origin 
county, destination county, cumulative duty, driving, and rest hours.

H.S.4 LH Safety Benefits 
Safety impacts were measured by feeding the working and driving schedules from the carrier 
simulation model into a fatigue model to project driver effectiveness levels, and then estimating 
the resulting changes in crash risks for different cases. Changes in fatigue-related crash risks, 
calibrated to match realistic levels, were then multiplied by the value of all affected crashes to 
yield estimates of total benefits. 
The approach to this analysis is illustrated in the flow diagram below. The crash and benefit 
analyses use the output of the truck operations simulations as the starting point for the analysis. 
The operations analyses provide a series of realistic truck driver schedules for each trucking 
industry segment. The schedules specify driver activity for each half hour (off duty, on-duty 
driving, and on-duty performing other activities such as loading, unloading, and waiting) over a 
multi-day period. The outputs of the simulations are also used as inputs into cost modeling. 
The simulation model does not provide estimates on how the driver splits off-duty time between 
sleep and other personal activities. A separate analysis to address this question was carried out 
151 
to add this information to the working schedules, based on sleep pattern surveys and similar 
research. These analyses led to a set of algorithms for sleep time based on the length of the 
break and the time of day at the start and end of the break.

Benefit Calculation: Value of 
Crashes and Damages Avoided 
The FAST/SAFTE human performance model, developed in part from research led by the Walter 
Reed Army Institute of Research, was used for the analysis. The model applies a large body of 
sleep and fatigue research, including circadian rhythms to provide an operator effectiveness 
percentage relative to a fully rested individual. The FAST/SAFTE model does not take into 
account TOT effects, so a separate analysis of these effects was performed to determine the 
relationship between TOT and crash risk. However, because the rule adopted in 2005 made no 
changes in the maximum number of driver hours per day, the results of the TOT analysis did not 
figure into the benefits calculations of the 2005 rule, but were used to evaluate alternatives that 
152 
reduced maximum drive time to 10 hours. 
H.5.4.1 Off-duty Sleep Time Assignment 
In order to use the FAST/SAFTE model to process the outputs of the operational model, it was 
necessary to determine how much sleep the drivers were getting and when that sleep would 
occur during a given off-duty period. The productivity analysis outlined above focused on the 
lengths of drivers' on-duty, off-duty, and driving periods. While the safety model requires the 
length of the on-duty and off-duty periods, it also requires the amount of sleep taken by the 
driver, and the placement of that sleep within the off-duty period. These are the two functions of 
the sleep allocation model. After a driver's schedule has been separated into on-duty periods, off-
duty periods and sleep periods, it is ready for input into the FAST/SAFTE model. 
The first step in the sleep allocation process is to determine how much sleep a driver is expected 
to get based on past work history. This calculation is a decreasing function based on the 
cumulative amount of on-duty time in the previous 24 hour period. The basic function is 
identical to the one used in the 2003 RIA. For a driver who works 14 hours a day on a 
continuous basis, that amounts to 6.57 hours of sleep per 24 hour period. Once the amount of 
sleep is determined, the model checks to see how much sleep the driver has received over the 
previous 24 hour period. If the driver has had more sleep than he is expected to get, a sleep 
surplus is assumed to exist. If the driver requires more sleep than he has received over the last 24 
hours, he has a sleep deficit and the model allocates sleep until the driver's deficit has been 
reduced to zero or until the driver begins his next on-duty period, whichever comes first. 
The second step in this process is the actual placement of the sleep within the off-duty period. To 
begin, the model consolidates all of the driver's sleep within a period of time. For off-duty 
periods less than 24 hours, it is assumed that the driver will rest in a single session, and so the 
sleep is consolidated into a single sleep period. For rest periods equal to or longer than 34 hours, 
the driver is assumed to be taking a week-end break or restart of some length, and multiple sleep 
periods will be allocated based on the length of the rest period. Once the sleep has been 
consolidated, it needs to be placed within the off-duty period. After some test runs involving 
different rest period lengths and times of day, it was assumed that the driver's sleep period 
153 
should be placed as late in his off-duty period as possible, while still allowing him to wake up 30 
minutes prior to the beginning of his next on-duty period. This 30-minute buffer was included to 
allow the driver to overcome any sleep inertia present when he awoke. It was determined that by 
placing the driver's sleep towards the end of his off-duty period, it allowed the start of the on-
duty period with the highest possible level of effectiveness. Whether drivers base their personal 
sleep allocation decisions on this same rationality is not clear at this time. 
H.5.4.2 Importance of Regularity in Driver Schedules 
Another observation from the results of the safety modeling was the importance of maintaining a 
'regular' schedule, referring to the driver's ability to work and rest in the same general timeframe 
over consecutive work days. The importance of regularity stems from the effect that circadian 
rhythm has on driver effectiveness. Those drivers that had substantial shifts in their daily 
work/rest cycle performed considerably worse than those drivers that maintained a relatively 
constant schedule. It should also be noted that those drivers that shift to an entirely new schedule 
and maintain it over a period of weeks will eventually adapt to the new circadian rhythm. It is 
those drivers that shift to a different schedule on a daily or weekly basis that show substantial 
drops in effectiveness. Chart 7 compares effectiveness (y axis) for regular versus variable 
schedules across the work week (x axis) as modeled in FAST/SAFTE.

The 'regular' driver, in addition to showing a higher overall effectiveness, also shows much less 
154 
variability in effectiveness. The large drops in effectiveness shown in the output of the variable-
schedule driver are a characteristic of a constantly changing schedule. In the two examples 
above, the average driver effectiveness over a one-year period for the 'regular' schedule driver 
was 92.95%. This compares very favorably to an average effectiveness of 77.89% for the driver 
with the variable schedule. 
H.5.4.3 Driver Effectiveness - Split v. Continuous Sleeper Berth Periods 
Another important observation from the FAST ISAFTE model was the difference in driver 
effectiveness values based on how drivers took their off-duty periods, and specifically their sleep 
periods. Of particular interest were drivers who split their sleep period as compared to those that 
chose not to split. To model these two different drivers, the Agency used the FAST/SAFTE 
model to calculate the effectiveness of drivers with 10 hours of on-duty time and 14 hours of off-
duty time each day. One driver was given the 14 hour off-duty period in one single block and the 
other driver was given two 7 hour off-duty blocks. Twelve simulations were run for each driver, 
each offset by 2 hours, to determine the combined effect of splitting and circadian rhythms. Four 
weeks of driver data were modeled for this particular analysis. In general, drivers who split their 
sleep period into two, 7 -hour blocks had lower levels of effectiveness than those drivers that took 
one continuous 14-hour break. Chart 8 shows two screen shots from the FAST/SAFTE model 
comparing driver effectiveness for a continuous and a split off-duty period. 
Chart 8: Continuous (left) Versus Split (right) Off Duty Periods 
155 
At different start times over the course of a 24-hour period, the driver that chooses not to split 
generally has a higher average effectiveness than the driver that splits. However, modeling 
shows that drivers beginning their shift between the hours of 22:00 and 0:00 show higher levels 
of effectiveness if they choose to split their rest period. Chart 9 illustrates these findings.

Estimate of Raw Crash Increment 
The primary source of data to form a link between crash risk and PVT scores produced by the 
FAST/SAFTE tool was a laboratory study carried out by Walter Reed Army Institute of 
Research, in which driving performance on a truck simulator was compared with PVT 
measurements for different levels of sleep deprivation. A robust straight line relationship 
between the log of crashes during a 45 minute driving session and fatigue level as measured by 
100-PVT score was obtained. Chart 10 shows the scatter plot and the linear relationship. PVT 
scores were scaled so that a score of 100 indicates a fully rested individual.

Estimate Actual Fatigue-Related Crash Risk. 
The final stem in the analysis is to convert the raw crash risk increments to an estimate of crash 
risk. This is achieved by calibrating the crash risk increments for a base case to real-world 
fatigue related crash data. The procedure is identical to that described used in the 2003 HOS 
RIA. The raw crash risk increments are the percentage increase in crash risk over the crash risk 
for a fully rested driver. Thus the proportional change in fatigue-related crashes is represented 
by the ratio: 
[100+crash increment for 2003 HOS Rules]/[100+crash increment for 2005 HOS Rules] 
The base case for this analysis is the fatigue-related crash risk for LH truck operations under the 
2003 HOS regulations, estimated at 7% of all truck involved crashes. The fatigue-related crash 
risk percentage for each of the HOS scenarios analyzed in this analysis is then as shown below: 
7.0 x [lOO+crash increment for 2005 Rule] 
[100+crash risk increment for 2003 HOS Rule] 
157 
H.5.4.6 Crash Risk Results 
The results of the crash risk modeling were found to be decrease in crash risk of 0.3 percent for 
LH operations. When these results are weighted by VMT such that experiences the real drivers 
can be extrapolated from the simulated drivers, the crash risk reduction was found to be 0.1 
percent. This percentage was valued by mUltiplying it by an estimate of the total annual damage 
associated with LH truck crashes. For consistency with the 2003 HOS analysis, the Agency used 
the value from the previous analysis of $32.2 billion in year 2000 dollars, or about $34.9 billion 
in year 2004 dollars. The 2003 RIA also presented an estimate of the percentage of total 
damages that were caused by the LH segment. Applying the same percentage - just over 58 
percent - to $34.9 billion yields just over $20 billion. The reduction in risk attributable to the 
2005 HOS rule, given this total value for all LH truck crash damages, is 0.1 % * $20 billion or 
about $20 million per year. 
H.5.5 LH Compliance Costs 
The analysis of costs recognizes that the different provisions of the options will affect carrier 
operations in complex and interacting ways. It also recognizes that these effects will depend 
strongly on the carriers' baseline operating patterns, which vary widely across this diverse 
industry. To produce a realistic measurement of the options' impacts, then, FMCSA divided the 
industry into broad segments, collected information on operations within these segments, and 
then created a model of carrier operations as they are affected by HOS rules. The variety of 
operational patterns made it necessary to limit the analysis to the most important cases. 
The model was first loaded with data representative of shipping patterns and carrier cost 
structures, and tested to ensure that it could realistically simulate typical lengths of haul, empty 
mile ratios, and productivity. It was then set up to cover most important cases, under constraints 
representing the options, and used to simulate carrier operations under different conditions. The 
Agency then analyzed the data representing the simulated operations, using changes in miles 
driven as a measure of productivity impacts. Output measures from individual runs were 
weighted to give a realistic representation of the affected industry, including the drivers' use of 
the most important provisions. The weighted changes in productivity from this procedure were 
158 
then used to estimate the cost increases imposed on the industry by the options, using an analysis 
of the changes in wages and other costs likely to result from changes in productivity. These 
productivity-related costs were combined with transition costs associated with shifting to new 
rules to produce estimates of total social costs. 
For representative carriers in each of several carrier size categories, the financial impact of the 
HOS rule was estimated in terms of the change in net income (in 2004$) to the carrier, as well as 
a change in profits as a fraction of operating revenues. The approach used to estimate these 
impacts involved the development of a pro forma financial model of firms of different sizes 
confronted by changes in productivity, wages, and prices. Financial impacts were estimated 
under two assumptions about prices of trucking services: unchanged prices (representing the 
short run), and prices after industry-wide cost changes have been passed through to consumers. 
The 2005 rule resulted in small adverse financial impacts (reduced profits) on most carriers, 
directly related to the magnitude of the drop in labor productivity. The results in terms of profit 
impacts relative to revenues seem to suggest very small impacts for firms across the wide range 
of size categories examined, including both large and small entities. The threshold for impacts 
considered to be of moderate size is generally taken to be one percent of revenues, and the 
average impacts of the rule fall well below that magnitude. 
H.5.5.1 Core Cost Components 
A significant portion of the total cost is driver labor costs. Changes in the number of hours 
drivers can work or drive were translated to changes in driver's labor productivities using the 
simulation model explained above. These changes were then used to calculate the additional 
number of drivers needed to achieve full compliance. Changes in the number of drivers were 
then translated into labor cost changes using the estimated wage-hours worked functional 
relationship for truck drivers used in the 2003 HOS RIA, described in section H.2.1.1.1 and table 
49 above. The changes made in the 2005 HOS rules were also evaluated with respect to the 
same non-wage costs considered in the 2003 HOS RIA, discussed in section H.2.2 above. 
The results of the simulation model described in section H.5.3 above showed a 3.9 percent 
159 
decrease in productivity for LH drivers (a 7.0 percent decrease for regional less a 3.1 percent 
productivity increase for LH OTR) using split sleeper berths as a result of the elimination of the 
sleep sleeper berth provision in the 2005 HOS rule. These percentages are calculated for the 
simulated drivers; to extrapolate to the real driver population, these figures were weighted 
according to the fraction of total VMT attributable to these drivers, resulting in a productivity 
loss of 0.042 percent (a 0.08 percent decrease for regional less a 0.038 percent productivity 
increase for LH OTR). 
The 2003 HOS rule analysis found that a 3.9 percent increase in LH labor productivity from the 
2003 rules could be valued at about $1 billion, or about $275 million per percentage point 
(referred to as the "unit cost") in year 2000 dollars. The 2005 rule analysis updated this figure to 
$298 million per percentage point of productivity year 2004 dollars using the GDP deflator. 
Converting the total cost changes to a unit cost number, as is done here, is possible because the 
2003 HOS analysis showed that there was a linear relationship between changes in driver labor 
productivity and the associated costs. Table 83 presents the breakdown of LH unit costs.

H.S.S.2 Training Costs for New HOS Rules 
Several commenters provided data on costs of re-training drivers and other personnel on changes 
to the HOS rules. Costs per driver varied between $7S and $lS0, and the Agency assumed $100 
in its analysis of the 200S HOS rule. Using a 7-percent interest rate, 10 years as the amortization 
period, and 1.S million total LH truck drivers (the same basis as for the 2003 RIA), it was 
calculated that the annualized re-training costs for the LH segment to be $21 million.
