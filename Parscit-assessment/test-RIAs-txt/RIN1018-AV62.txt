Economic Background and Significance 
 
The purpose of this economic analysis is to determine the economic effects of Federal 
regulatory alternatives for the 2008-2009 hunting season for migratory birds.  This 
analysis centers on changing daily bag limits and season lengths, the two most important 
policy variables in the Federal framework.  The analysis will show that differences in 
those key variables between alternatives result in measurable changes in the number of 
hunters, how often they hunt, and the amount of consumer surplus they enjoy as well as 
the amount of money they spend in pursuit of their sport.  There are two components to 
this analysis: first, each of the regulatory alternatives will be evaluated for their effects on 
consumer surplus and second, each alternative will be evaluated for their effects on 
hunter expenditures.  The results of this analysis will document the expected economic 
effects of the final framework for the 2008-2009 Fall migratory bird hunting season.     
 
Migratory birds are a renewable, international, common property resource.  Unlike 
resources with clear ownership, individuals have little or no incentive to conserve 
common property resources.  A bird not taken today may be taken by another hunter 
tomorrow.  Therefore, each consumer has an incentive to take as much of the resource as 
they can capture, so all consumers together can overexploit the resource.  This type of 
market failure is termed an externality in that the actions of one party impose costs on 
others that cannot be captured by a market transaction.  Over harvesting at the turn of the 
century resulted in depleted bird populations and inspired the Migratory Bird Treaties 
between the United States, Great Britain (Canada), Mexico, Japan, and the Soviet Union.   
 
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act) implementing the treaties authorizes the Secretary 
of the Interior to establish national frameworks within which States may establish 
migratory bird hunting regulations.  The status of migratory bird populations are 
discussed in a series of annual reports available at 
http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/reports/reports.html.   Annual environmental 
considerations are covered under a separate Environmental Assessment (EA), “Duck 
Hunting Regulations for 2007,” and an annual Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) 
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007).  Copies of the EA and FONSI are available upon 
request. 
 
The Act is permissive.  Without the national frameworks, the states cannot establish 
hunting seasons and hunting is prohibited.  The national framework indirectly regulates 
migratory bird hunting in the United States by setting maximums for season length and 
bag limits under which the States can set hunting regulations.  The States can be more 
restrictive than the Federal framework but not more lenient (e.g. the States can set shorter 
seasons and/or lower bag limits).    
 
Government policies generate economic effects by changing the use of resources in the 
economy.  Alternative resource allocations may increase the efficiency of the national 
economy and generate greater welfare for its citizens, or policies may redistribute 
resources from one region or industry to another.  The former are national economic 
 2
effects.  The latter are regional economic effects.  By permitting hunting, the migratory 
bird hunting framework regulations generate both types of effects. 
 
Approximately 1.5 million people reported buying duck stamps in 2006 according to the 
2006 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (2006 
National Survey).  In addition to State hunting licenses, duck stamps are necessary to 
hunt ducks or geese in the United States.  This analysis looks at duck hunting and the 
economic effects of regulatory alternatives on that major component of all migratory bird 
hunting.  Sufficient data exists for duck hunting to generate an analysis of hunter 
behavior in response to regulatory alternatives.  The analysis for all migratory bird 
hunting is not possible because of data limitations but can be inferred from the results of 
the duck hunting analysis presented here.  Duck hunting represented approximately 50 
percent of all migratory bird hunting in 2006 (2006 National Survey).   
 
Evidently, hunters by their choice to hunt, demonstrate that they derive more pleasure 
from duck hunting than from their next most preferred option for spending that time and 
money.  The increment in their welfare versus the next most preferred activity and the 
increment in producer surplus versus the next most productive use of the resources are 
the national welfare benefits of duck hunting.   
The magnitude of these welfare effects indicate that the migratory bird hunting 
frameworks constitute an economically significant rule, under the definition of Executive 
Order 12866.  
 
Effects of Allowing Hunting of the Migratory Bird Population 
 
The annual Environmental Assessment of the migratory bird hunting regulations provides 
detailed descriptions of three alternative frameworks for the annual duck hunting season: 
 
Alternative 1.  Issue restrictive regulations allowing fewer days than those issued 
during the 2007-2008 season. 
 
Alternative 2.  Issue moderate regulations allowing more days that those in 
alternative 1. 
 
Alternative 3.  Issue liberal regulations identical to the regulations in the 2007-
2008 season.     
 
The Service proposes to issue liberal migratory bird hunting regulations in 2008-2009 
(Preferred Alternative 3).  A final determination of which alternative to promulgate will 
be made when the analysis of the bird population status, due to be completed in the 
summer of 2008, is available.     
 
Theoretical Model 
 
Two approaches for looking at participant behavior are the Random Utility Model 
(RUM) and conjoint analysis.  The RUM model is a discrete choice model that uses an 
 3
individual’s utility function to explain an individual’s choice among recreational sites.  
By incorporating recreational site attributes into the model, it is possible to measure the 
impact on welfare due to changes in site attributes.   
 
 
The kth hunter’s utility function from a visit to site j for i days can be described as: 
 
Uijk = Vk(Tjk, Aj, Sk) + !ijk
 
where Tjk = vector of travel costs for hunter k to site j 
 Aj = vector of attributes for site j 
 Sk = vector of socioeconomic attributes for hunter k 
 Uijk = unobservable utility for hunter k at site j for i days. 
 
The hunter will choose to hunt ducks at a particular site for a number of days if his utility 
from hunting ducks at a particular site is greater than his utility of hunting for another 
animal at another site.  The probability that a hunter will choose to participate in duck 
hunting at site j for i days is given as: 
 
P(ijk) = P(i|j)P(j|k)P(k) 
 
where P(k) is the marginal probability of choosing to duck hunt, P(j|k) is the conditional 
probability of choosing site j given that the hunter chooses to duck hunt, and P(i|j) is the 
conditional probability of duck hunting for i days given that site j is chosen. 
 
For the migratory bird harvest regulation, the random utility model would have a nested 
logit specification with three sequential decision-making levels.  A nested model is 
necessary to ensure that the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property is not 
violated.  The IIA property assumes that the probability of choosing one alternative 
among two or more different types of recreational activities/sites is independent of the 
probability of choosing another alternative.  By nesting together similar decisions, the IIA 
property holds true.  The following figure diagrams the hunter’s decision making process 
for duck hunting.

The RUM is a good model to use to estimate the change in hunters’ welfare as a result of 
a policy that changes duck hunting season length or bag limit.  However, the migratory 
bird harvest regulation is a nationwide regulation covering 4 migratory bird flyways and 
49 States with a vast number of site options for the duck hunter (equation B in Figure 1).  
To perform a valid RUM would require detailed information for each possible duck 
hunting site within the regulated 49 States.  Thus, the data necessary to conduct a RUM 
would be prohibitively expensive to collect.  The current National Survey of Fishing, 
Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation collects data on hunters by state of 
residence and activity but the state level of specificity would make the application of a 
RUM model nearly impossible.  
 
Conjoint analysis is a modeling technique more suited to household surveys.  The model 
consists of a series of scenarios that are framed as possible choices for the respondent.  
For each scenario, key variables are given different values along with other variables that 
don’t change and the respondent is asked to pick the preferred scenario.  This approach 
holds promise to model hunting behavior as the scenarios could be specified to include 
alternative sites and activities.  This approach has not been used for migratory bird 
 5
hunting nationwide, and as a result this approach cannot be implemented for the current 
analysis. 
 
A model of duck hunting economics to compare the impact of each of the three 
alternatives was developed and is described in Appendix A.  Current economic effects 
were determined by comparisons with Alternative 1.  For purposes of analysis the base 
case was set as the restrictive Federal framework, i.e. the minimum migratory bird 
hunting permitted.  This is referred to at alternative 1.  Alternatives 2, and 3 result in 
increasing hunting days reflecting an increase in consumer surplus when compared to the 
baseline (alternative 1).  The estimated economic benefits resulting from the preferred 
alternative (alternative 3) are the maximum achievable with the proposed framework.   
 
Estimating Consumer Surplus 
 
Estimates of individual’s willingness to pay for duck hunting provides some insight into 
the size of the consumer surplus derived from this activity.  Willingness to pay for 
migratory waterfowl hunting (which includes both ducks and geese) averaged $67 per 
day (2007$) (Walsh, Johnson, and McKean 1990).  This is the average of 17 estimates 
the authors found in the research literature.  In order to account for regional differences in 
consumer surplus estimates, data for estimating consumer surplus of waterfowl hunting 
by flyway are needed.  The most recent flyway estimates in the existing literature has 
only one study where sufficient data were collected to derive consumer surplus estimates 
by flyway.  Hay (1988) is the only study found that estimated values for each of the four 
flyways.  Average consumer surplus estimates are required to evaluate the alternative 
duck hunting frameworks, which are specified by flyway.  In this report, the average 
consumer surplus is presented as a range taken from the Hay (1988) study.  To date, this 
is the most recent study that estimated consumer surplus by flyway.  The daily consumer 
surplus estimates are used to determine the economic value of the baseline (restrictive 
migratory bird hunting regulations) and the estimated effects of changes brought about by 
different frameworks.  The estimates from the Hay (1988) study provided the 95 percent 
confidence intervals for flyway consumer surplus per day used in this analysis.  The 
estimates range from $36 to $58 (2007 $)per hunting day.  The days of duck hunting 
reported in the 2006 Migratory Bird Hunting Activity and Harvest during the 2005 and 
2006 hunting seasons – Preliminary Estimates (July 2007) were used to estimate the 
consumer surplus effects in the baseline.  The results are shown in Table 1 below.  This is 
the estimate for the consumer surplus if restrictive migratory bird hunting regulations 
were issued for the 2008-2009 season.  The range of estimates used is more conservative 
than the Walsh, Johnson, and McKean findings from the literature. 
 
Table 1.  Consumer Surplus for the Baseline for Duck Hunting (Alternative 1) 
 
   Duck Hunting  Consumer Surplus Total  
Flyway  Days   Per Day (2007 $) Consumer Surplus 
      
Atlantic  626,000  $36 - $52  $22 - $32 million 
Mississippi  2,622,000  $42 - $54  $110 - $141 million 
 6
Central  809,000  $40 - $50  $32 - $40 million 
Pacific   980,000  $42- $58  $41- $57 million
Total   5,037,000     $205 - $270 million 
 
The national estimate of the consumer surplus with restrictive duck hunting regulations 
ranges from $205 million to $270 million (2007$) annually, with a mid-point estimate of 
$238 million.  This surplus would be enjoyed by an estimated 741 thousand duck hunters.         
 
Estimating Producer Surplus: Alternative 1/Baseline 
 
The estimation of producer surplus is the missing value for a complete analysis of the 
economic benefits generated by the migratory bird framework.  Producer surplus is more 
difficult to quantify in the case of a natural resource.  There may be some producer 
surplus associated with land leases for access to waterfowl hunting as well as habitat 
leases to provide primary constituent elements needed to allow waterfowl to reproduce.  
Any producer surplus associated with the sale of equipment and services to hunters is not 
easily estimated since the data on profits margins for all these items are not known.  Also, 
the large numbers of suppliers of services and equipment would tend to eliminate excess 
profits through competition.  Since most, if not all the services and equipment have non-
duck hunting applications, producers would tend to not be able to set a price that would 
include excess profits.  Data to estimate producer surplus are not available and most 
likely producer surplus is minimal compared to consumer surplus. 
 
Consumer Surplus Effects of Alternative Frameworks  
 
An economic model of duck hunting was developed and estimated to evaluate the 
alternative duck hunting frameworks (Appendix A).  This model is used to estimate 
changes in annual duck hunting days, changes in expenditures, and the changes in 
consumer surplus.  An analysis of the alternative frameworks shows that the proposed 
framework for the 2008-2009 hunting season will maximize consumer surplus.  Producer 
surplus, which is not estimated, should also be maximized, if it exists.  All the alternative 
frameworks allow hunting regulations to be established, so there is a positive consumer 
surplus when compared to the base case (restrictive hunting regulations).  The net effect 
of alternative frameworks results in relatively modest increases in consumer surplus 
primarily reflecting the fact that the frameworks are not severely binding on duck hunters 
decisions on how many days to hunt.  The differences between season length, days afield, 
and bag limits and actual harvest are large enough that only marginal changes in hunter 
behavior are expected from alternative frameworks.  The season length and bag limits set 
in the National framework, for example 90 days of hunting and 5 as a bag limit per day, 
are significantly higher than the typical hunters hunting for 8 days and having a bag per 
day slightly above 1 duck per day.  Any changes in the National framework are expected 
to have only a small impact on hunter behavior.  The result of using the model in 
Appendix A to evaluate the alternatives is given in Table 2 below.  The mid-point of the 
consumer surplus per day values were used to develop the table 2 estimates.

The frameworks safeguard the efficient use of the resource over time by imposing limits 
on its exploitation.  Overexploitation when access to the resource was unconstrained 
threatened its sustainability.  Limiting resource consumption ensures future hunting 
opportunities and the resulting benefits to hunters. 
 
The frameworks have little direct effect on other agencies’ actions nor any material 
budgetary impact.  As the framework procedure has been in place for over 20 years, no 
novel legal or policy issues are raised by these regulations.   
 
Economic Effects of Alternative Frameworks
 
Table 2 shows the estimated increases in consumer surplus from duck hunting of the 
alternative frameworks when compared to the base case for each flyway.  The total 
increases in consumer surplus ranges from $237.7 million for the restrictive framework to 
$317.9 million for the preferred framework.   
 
Alternative 1 This alternative includes restrictive regulations allowing fewer days than 
those issued in 2007-2008.  Bag limits are 3 ducks below the 2007 levels 
and seasons are 30 to 47 days shorter.  The reduced bag limit reduces the 
probability of hunting about 1 percent resulting in 238,000 fewer hunters.  
Total hunting days would be approximately 1.7 million fewer days.  Taken 
 8
together the restrictive framework results in an estimated $237.7 million 
(2007$) in duck hunter consumer surplus.   
 
Alternative 2 Bag limits under this alternative are the same as under the preferred 
alternative (Alternative 3) but season lengths are 14 to 21 days shorter.  
Duck hunters would spend fewer days afield.  The reduced season length 
decreases the probability of hunting resulting in 112,000 fewer hunters.  
Estimated consumer surplus would be $277.4 million (2007$).     
 
Alternative 3 The preferred regulations similar to the 2007-2008 regulations have the  
most positive economic effect when compared to the base case used in this 
analysis.  The estimated consumer surplus ranges from $274 to $362 
million with a mid-point estimate of $318 million.  The bag limits and 
season lengths results in an estimated 979 thousand duck hunters.  This 
alternative is the preferred alternative and maximizes the total hunters’ 
welfare benefits which are related to bag and days afield. 
 
The differences between alternatives are relatively small.  This reflects the fact that there 
is only a small influence of the national frameworks to changing the actual days afield 
and hunter bag.     
 
Duck hunting accounted for approximately 62 percent of all migratory bird hunting days 
in 2006.  This analysis of duck hunting benefits, if extrapolated to all migratory bird 
hunting, would be 38 percent higher than the current estimate.  There is no data to 
support this extrapolation so it is not performed and assumed to represent total migratory 
bird hunting benefits. 
 
State Costs of the Rule 
 
The framework regulations for migratory bird hunting impose some costs of 
administration and enforcement on the States.  If there were no migratory bird hunting, 
the States could apply their resources to different ends.  As the States also derive revenue 
from licenses and sales taxes on hunting supplies, the net effect on State resources is 
uncertain.   
 
If States were free to set hunting seasons and bag limits (abrogating the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act), some might opt for longer seasons and higher bag limits without regard to 
the health of the waterfowl populations.  To the extent the frameworks constrain the 
regulatory regime these States may impose, the framework imposes an opportunity cost 
on the States.  The opportunity cost is the lost revenue and hunter expenditures the State 
cannot recover because it is constrained by the framework in its hunting regulations.  
There is no way to quantify this cost.  In particular, the long run impact of over 
harvesting the population would be difficult to estimate and value.

SMALL ENTITY ANALYSIS  
 
Regional Benefits of the Rule 
 
This rule will have national economic benefits in the form of increased consumer surplus 
in excess of $100 million.  This rule will set in place the proposed national framework for 
the establishment of migratory bird hunting for the 2008-2009 season.  While the national 
framework is aimed at regulating hunter behavior, it has indirect effects in the form of 
hunter expenditures that affect small businesses nationwide.  Although expenditures on 
hunting are an important effect to understand they do not constitute benefits of the rule 
since they are offset by reduced expenditures on other activities not related to hunting.  
Because of the magnitude of direct expenditures (a total of $1.4 billion in 2007 dollars), 
which includes special equipment with some portion going to small entities, the Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service) estimates that this regulation is a major rule under the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.  Consequently, the Service believes the 
rule will have a significant beneficial economic effect on a substantial number of small 
entities.  This impact will be focused on regions with high migratory bird hunting 
activity.  As a result, this updated economic analysis is being made available for public 
review.   
 
Major categories of Hunter Expenditures
 
Waterfowl and other migratory bird hunting represent an important part of the total 
economic activity generated by fishing and hunting in the United States.  The National 
Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation (2006 Survey) indicates 
that migratory bird hunter expenditures, exclusive of licenses, stamps, tags, permits, and 
special equipment  totaled over $1.2 billion in 2006(2007$). 
 
This analysis looks at duck hunting and the economic effects of regulatory alternatives on 
that major component of migratory bird hunting.  Expenditure data specific to duck 
hunters are not directly available from the Survey.  An estimate of duck hunter 
expenditures was obtained by using the numbers of active duck hunters and hunter days 
reported in the 2006 Waterfowl Harvest and Hunter Activity Administrative Report and 
the per capita and per day expenditure data reported in the 2006 Survey updated to 2007 
dollars.  Resulting expenditures for travel and equipment in the four flyways totaled $1.2 
billion (2007$).  Equipment and daily spending were estimated for each flyway.  
Equipment expenditures are calculated as per hunter equipment spending in the 2006 
Survey times the number of duck hunters reported in the Administrative Report.  Daily 
expenditures are calculated as variable expenditures (food, travel, and lodging) per year 
divided by total days from the 2006 Survey multiplied by duck hunter days from the 
Administrative Report.  (All dollar figures in this section are constant 2007 dollars.) 
 
 10
Assuming that duck hunters distributed their spending among the Survey’s travel 
expenditure categories in the same way as did other migratory bird hunters in 2006, duck 
hunters spending would have been as follows: 
 
CATEGORY     PERCENT  EXPENDITURES 
Equipment 41.27% $502.2 million 
Food 17.3  211.2 
Transportation 36.6  445.9 
Lodging   4.9   59.4 
Other 0 0 
Total 100.0% $1,218.7 million 
 
Migratory bird hunters spent $1.2 billion for guns, ammunition, travel, and recreational 
services in 2006 (2007 $).  These resources would have been spent on other activities if 
migratory bird hunting had not been possible so they do not represent a change in 
national economic efficiency or welfare.  Nevertheless, this spending is important for the 
industries and regions where the money is spent.  If items like hunting camps, off-road 
vehicles, and land are included, 2006 spending for migratory bird hunting increases 
substantially.    
 
Beneficiaries of the Rule
 
There were an estimated 979 thousand active duck hunters in the U.S. in 2006 (U.S. 
Department of the Interior 2007).  The number of duck hunting stamps sold in the U.S. 
has increased in the last ten years going from approximately 1 million in 1991 to 1.5 
million in 2006.  Because of differences in survey methodologies the number of stamps 
sold and hunter estimates cannot be reconciled at this time.  In addition to hunters, a wide 
range of businesses and individuals benefit economically from the establishment of the 
annual migratory bird hunting regulations.  A partial list of migratory bird hunter 
expenditure categories and the types of businesses that benefit from those expenditures 
are shown below. 
 
Migratory bird hunting regulations generate significant economic activity for small 
businesses.  Nationwide, migratory bird hunters spent $1.2 billion at small businesses in 
2006 (Table 3).  Over 960 thousand  small businesses will share in these sales.  All but 
four of the States with reported sales derive, as a minimum, an excess of $2 million in 
small business sales from migratory bird hunting.

Limited information is available on the number of businesses and individuals in the 
various categories who benefit from duck hunter expenditures.  This is not surprising 
considering that those who provide equipment, supplies and services to duck hunters 
often provide identical or similar items to non-hunters.  For example: 
 
1. A motel in a duck hunting area may obtain a portion of its income from duck hunters.  
Registrants are not requested to indicate the nature of their travel.  The same situation 
prevails for food service establishments, gasoline stations, etc. 
 
2. The number of sporting goods stores in the United States is obtainable.  However, 
such stores may cater to fishermen, bowlers, skiers, joggers, etc., in addition to 
hunters.  Without knowledge of their specialty, knowing the number of sporting 
goods stores is not sufficient. 
 
3. Considerable leasing of lands for hunting and other purposes is accomplished 
informally without record keeping, and the payment is often in cash or otherwise 
undocumented. 
 
Methods 
 
This analysis combines information from the 2006  National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, 
and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (Surveys), the U.S. Department of Commerce 
County Business Patterns 2006 database, and the fisher library web site at the University 
of Virginia to develop estimates of migratory bird hunters’ expenditures at small 
businesses.  The Survey provides excellent information about hunters and anglers 
expenditures for sporting trips and equipment.  Trip expenditures are categorized as food, 
lodging, transportation, and other travel items (e.g., guide fees, access fees, and rentals).  
Equipment expenditures include guns, ammunition, and decoys.  Expenditures for 
magazines, memberships, vehicles, cabins, land, and dogs are excluded from this 
analysis.  As very few respondents purchased these items, the data are considered 
unreliable.     
 
The Surveys do not collect information about vendors.  Therefore, another method is 
necessary to find the proportion of total expenditures that can be attributed to small 
businesses.  The U.S. Department of Commerce publishes the County Business Patterns 
 12
database that includes the number of enterprises by county and North American Industrial 
Classification (NAIC).  For this analysis, a small business is defined as any business 
having less than 50 employees.  The County Business Patterns information permits 
calculation of small business’ share of establishments but not their share of sales.  An 
alternative methods was used to allocate sales to small businesses from establishment 
information for each State.  If all businesses sell about the same amount, the share of 
expenditures spent at small businesses will be the proportion small business 
establishments are to the total number of establishments.  This proportion probably 
overstates small business’ share.  A large discount department store probably sells more 
guns and ammunition than a small neighborhood gun shop.  Using this method generates 
estimates of expenditures by migratory bird hunters at small businesses.  To illustrate the 
State level of benefits, the following tables have been developed based on the 2006 
National Survey.  The estimates are reported in Table 3 and are shown by State and 
expenditure category.  All expenditures in this section are reported in thousands of 2007 
dollars. 
 
Table 4, Estimated Migratory Bird Hunters’ Expenditures on Food, illustrates the 
calculations for each of the expenditure categories shown on Tables 4 through 7.  The 
first column contains State totals of the amounts respondents to the Survey reported they 
spent for food while on trips whose primary purpose was to hunt migratory birds.  Food 
may be bought at a restaurant (NAIC 5812) or grocery store (NAIC 5410) so both types 
of establishments were combined.  The second column shows the number of 
establishments in NAIC 5812 or 5410 in each State.  The third column shows the number 
of establishments categorized a small businesses in each State.  The proportion small 
business establishments are of the total is the method used to allocate expenditures to 
small businesses.  This allocation is shown in the fifth column.   
 
Although more than 25,000 hunters and anglers were interviewed for the Survey, these 
expenditure estimates are based on only those who actually hunted during 2006 and 
stated that the primary purpose of their trip or equipment purchase was hunting migratory 
birds.  Only a small subset of hunters in each State meets both criteria so the expenditures 
are quite sensitive to individual responses.  Zero totals are based on small sample sizes.  
Small samples may also inflate expenditure estimates.  A zero estimate for a state 
indicates a small sample size and no estimate was attempted. 
 
County business pattern information may also introduce errors.  To avoid disclosure of 
private information, the Census Bureau withholds employment information when there 
are few establishments in a geographic area.  Exclusion of a single large employer can 
greatly affect the proportion attributed to small business.  In addition, entry of enough 
firms into an area results in all of the establishments appearing in the statistics.  This 
exacerbates the instability of the published series.  No effort was made to compensate for 
unreported firms in this analysis. 
 
Surveys of a wide range of businesses would be required to obtain the necessary detailed 
data.  The Small Entity Analysis included in this section spreads expenditures across all 
beneficiary businesses in proportion to the number of establishments.

The direct expenditures described above cycle through the economy generating additional 
income and sales.  Analysis of this multiplier effect is beyond the scope of this report but 
clearly $1.2 billion is the minimum benefit from the migratory bird regulations.   
 
 
 
 
Results 
 
Migratory bird hunting generates considerable revenue for small businesses.  In Arkansas 
and Texas, migratory bird hunting would be considered a significant industry generating 
over $100 million in expenditures in each state.  The multiplier effect in each of these 
regions generates significantly more economic activity.  Nationwide, migratory bird 
hunters will spend approximately $1.2 billion at thousands of small businesses in 2006.  
Some of this economic activity would occur without the annual promulgation of hunting 
regulations.  Since much of the equipment and services used in migratory bird hunting 
can be used for other purposes, some of the annual sales would continue even if 
migratory bird hunting were prohibited.  Much, if not all of this business activity would 
be redirected to alternative pursuits.      
 
Evaluation of Alternatives 
 
Each alternative outlined above results in a different level of economic stimulus 
generated from duck hunter spending.  State expenditures for enforcement of duck 
hunting regulations are not affected by any of the proposed alternatives.  In each case, the 
States would be required to field about the same enforcement effort.  Only if the 
frameworks greatly relaxed bag limits and seasons would the States be able to reduce 
enforcement effort significantly.  Alternatives 1 and 2 will reduce State license sales and 
sales taxes on hunting goods compared to the preferred Alternative 3.  These revenue 
losses would be in addition to the lost benefits of expenditures in local economies.   
 
Although reduced hunting now may result in more ducks to hunt next year, higher 
populations also increase the risk of disease outbreaks and unhealthy competition, in the 
absence of adequate natural predation.  The opportunity cost of duck hunting, ignoring 
long run effects, is minimized by the preferred framework, Alternative 3.

Introduction
 
To analyze the 2008-2009 migratory bird hunting framework, an economic model was 
necessary that described hunter behavior under different regulatory frameworks.  
Available data to apply any model efforts consisted of the 2006 National Survey of 
Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-Associated Recreation and the Administrative Reports for 
the 2005-2006 waterfowl hunting season.  The 2006 National Survey is the most current 
database that is comprehensive enough to allow this type of analysis.  The 2006 Survey 
data is still in its final stage of review before being released for detail analysis.  The 
primary research interest of this analysis is the tradeoff between season length and bag 
limit assuming a desired total harvest of ducks.  This is not the question these alternative 
frameworks pose.  Each framework varies both bag limit and season length in order to 
not over harvest the species.  The present analysis seeks to quantify these relationships 
and apply them to changes in both season length and bag limit.  
 
Because of the less stringent data requirements, the empirical approach employed for this 
analysis is a reduced form of the random utility model by bypassing the site decision 
equation.  The hunter’s decision is limited to two questions.  First, does the hunter choose 
to hunt ducks?  Second, how many total days does the hunter choose to hunt ducks during 
one hunting season?  The methodology used to analyze the impacts of varying the season 
length and/or bag limit is explained in the following text. 
 
In any season, the total harvest of ducks (K) is the product of average bag per day per 
hunter (B), average days afield per hunter per season (DAF), the probability that a hunter 
will hunt ducks (PROB), and total hunters of all game (H): 
  
 (1)   K = (B) (DAF) (PROB) H 
 
The variables in the model and in the subsequent empirical analysis are defined in Table 
8.  The analysis was conducted under the assumption that total harvest, K, is set 
according to annual biological considerations.  To develop the parameters of the model it 
was assumed that once K is determined, it remains constant under all alternative 
combinations of daily bag and season length.  Therefore in the model, any change in K, 
denoted as (dK), is equated to zero. 
 
This can be seen in the total differential of equation (1): 
 
 (2) 0
!PROB
!K     d(PROB)
!DAF
!K      dDAF
!B
!K dBdK "##"  
 
The differential shows that the various components of dK can be allowed to vary as long 
as the effects of their changes on K net out to zero.  The components are the changes in 
duck harvest that can be attributed to changes in bag per day (dB), days afield (dDAF), 
and probability (dPROB).  It is assumed that total number of hunters (H) remains 
 26
constant.  Measuring the compensating changes in these components is what ultimately 
permits the determination of the tradeoffs between bag limit and season length.  The 
magnitude of the change in harvest caused by each of the components is the product of 
the initial change in the component and the partial derivative of K with respect to the 
component.  For example, the effect on K of a change in daily bag (dB) is the product of 
dB and the partial derivative of harvest with respect to daily bag (!K/!B).  Thus, equation 
(2) summarizes the nature of the tradeoffs between daily bag limits and season length in 
setting the regulatory framework.  It shows that any increase in daily bag (dB > 0) must 
be offset by decreases in DAF and PROB such that total harvest remains the same (dK = 
0).

To measure those tradeoffs it is first necessary to express the components of (2) in other 
terms.  From equation (1), the partial derivatives of total harvest with respect to daily bag 
(B), days afield (DAF), and probability (PROB) are:

Two equations were specified to incorporate hunter behavior into the model.  It is 
assumed that a hunter makes two decisions. 
 
First, a hunter decides whether to hunt ducks.  The decision to participate is binary; the 
individual either hunts ducks (PROB=1) or he does not (PROB=0).  The mean of PROB 
is the proportion of hunters that hunts ducks, the participation rate. 
 
As discussed in detail below, the decision to participate is influenced by a number of 
factors.  The probability that a given hunter will hunt ducks is a function of age, sex, 
residence in a rural versus urban area, income, season length, and the amount of 
waterfowl habitat and the bag per day per hunter in the individual’s home state.  To 
simplify the discussion, all factors influencing the decision to hunt ducks except bag per 
day can be combined in the intercept (a), making the probability that an individual hunts 
ducks a function of bag per day. 
 
 (3) PROB = a + bB 
 
Second, after deciding to hunt ducks the hunter must decide how many days to hunt 
during the season (DAF).  The days afield decision is influenced by a number of the same 
variables: income, availability of duck habitat, and bag per day.  Once again, all factors 
influencing DAF except bag per day can be summarized in the intercept ©. 
 
 (4) DAF = c + eB 
 
Solving equation (4) for B and substituting into equation (3) yields: 
 
 (5)

c)-b(DAFaPROB #"  
 
The derivative of (5) with respect to DAF is:

Substituting (6) and the partial derivatives (2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) into equation (2) and 
solving for the change in DAF results in:

Equation (7) may be simplified by combining all factors on the right hand side except dB 
into a constant, J.  This makes the tradeoffs between changes in DAF and B apparent, in 
equation (8).

 (8) dDAF = -dB(J) 
 
Note that B in the model is actual bag whereas the policy variable set in the regulations is 
bag limit (BL), a maximum number of ducks per day attained by relatively few hunters.  
The estimated relationship between changes in B and BL for each flyway is shown in 
Table 10.  When dBL is known, the corresponding dB is determined from those 
estimates.  The change in days afield (dDAF) for a given dB is derived from (8).  With H 
and K constant, the new probability (PROB) is then calculated by substituting the new 
levels of DAF and B into equation (1).  This keeps the duck hunters in the flyway on the 
isoquant representing a constant total harvest (K) while allowing BL and SL to vary. 
 
The change in SL consistent with the change in BL is determined programmatically.  The 
elasticity of SL with respect to DAF (the ratio of the percent change in SL to the percent 
change in DAF):

Equation (9) shows how much DAF must change in response to the change in SL to 
produce the required new level of BL.  If BL is increased, SL must decrease if total 
harvest is to be held constant.  
 
After the new probability of duck hunting is determined, the difference (dPROB) 
between it and the base probability is multiplied by the total number of hunters (H) to 
obtain the change in the number of duck hunters (dDH).  Assuming that the new hunters 
will spend the same amount on equipment as the average of previous duck hunters 
(AES), the product of dDH and AES is the first part of the economic impact (IMP1) 
 29
caused by changing BL.  The second part of the impact (IMP2) is the change in variable 
expenditures.  It is the product of dHD, the change in hunter days due to the change in 
BL, and average variable spending (AVS) per day. 
 
 (10) Impact = IMP1 + IMP2
 
 (10.1) IMP1 = dDH(AES), where: 
 dDH = (dPROB)(H) 
 
 (10.2) IMP2 = (dHD)(AVS), where: 
    dHD = dDH(DAF + dDAF) + dDAF(DH) 
 
Thus, the economic impacts are measured as changes from the base case in terms of 
hunter equipment spending and spending for food, travel and lodging as the number of 
duck hunters and days afield change in response to the regulatory alternatives. 
 
Estimation of the Model Parameters 
As discussed above, the individual hunter is assumed to first decide whether to hunt 
ducks and then decide the amount of time to spend in the field.  The individual’s decision 
whether or not to hunt ducks is specified as a function of age, sex, residence in rural 
versus urban areas, income, season length, and average bag per day and amount of 
waterfowl habitat in the hunter’s home state.  The last two variables are included as 
measures of the relative quality and availability of waterfowl among states.  The days 
afield (DAF) equation is a function of household income, average daily harvest, season 
length, and residence in rural versus urban areas.  The variables in the equations are 
defined in Table 8.  Data used for this analysis are from the 2006 National Survey of 
Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation, and the Waterfowl Harvest and 
Hunter Activity Administrative Reports for the 1979 through 2006 seasons.  These data 
sources provide the required variability in harvest, season length and bag limits to allow 
the estimation of the economic model. 
 
The two equations were estimated on a national basis because there was insufficient 
variation for some variables to estimate individually for each flyway.  The probability 
equation was estimated with logit equation, and the days afield equation was estimated 
with ordinary least squares.  Below each parameter estimate is the t-value in parentheses. 
The probability equation is estimated for all hunters.  The days afield equation is 
estimated for those hunters who hunted ducks.  The results are shown in Table 9 below.

In equation (11), all coefficients are significant and show that the probability that a hunter 
will hunt ducks is higher for male hunters and residents of urban areas, other things being 
equal.  The probability decreases among older hunters but increases with household 
income and with the quality of duck hunting and length of the season in the home state.  
BD05, representing average daily bag in the previous year, was used instead of B as a 
measure of the quality of hunting in the individual’s home state.  The quality of the 
previous year’s duck hunting was considered a more relevant factor for hunter decisions 
in 2007.   
 
In equation (12), only coefficients for season length and bag per day are significant.  The 
coefficients of BD05 is positive and SL is negative which indicates that hunters in states 
with a higher bag per day hunt ducks more days per year than do hunters in other states, 
and the negative coefficient on season length is probably due to the fact that season 
length for some flyways is so long that it has no influence on days afield, other things 
being equal.  Also, the number of days spent duck hunting is inversely related to income 
and residents of urban areas, other things being equal. 
 
Estimates of equations (3) and (4) were developed for each flyway from the coefficients 
in (11) and (12) by using flyway mean values for all independent variables except BD05 
and collapsing them into the intercept (Table 10).  The same coefficients of BD05 from 
 31
equations (11) and (12) were used in all flyways.  For example, the intercept (a) in the 
probability equation is 10.509 for the Mississippi Flyway.  The slope (b) in the 
probability equation is 0.002 for all flyways.  The key parameters used in the analysis are 
sown in Table 10 below.

Elasticity of SL to DAF 4.427 5.509 3.875 2.884 
 
The elasticity of SL with respect to DAF (percent change in SL due to a one percent 
change in DAF) was estimated from a set of time series/cross section data for the years 
1979 to 2006.  The equation is as follows: 
 
DAF = 4.27 + .034SL + ..503lagged bag/day + .836 split seasons + .163 zones +  
  (.008)     (.412)     (.283)    (.229)

                (.011)         (.358)  
 
R squared = .81 
N = 108 
 
The partial of DAF with respect to SL = .034 computed for the nation was converted to a 
flyway specific elasticity of SL with respect to DAF – the percent change of SL for a one 
percent change in DAF.  This was done by taking the reciprocal and multiplying it by the 
ration of DAF to SL for each flyway.  The Mississippi Flyway elasticity is 5.509. 
 
The remaining estimates for the preferred alternative representing the 2006 hunting 
season were obtained from other sources.  Starting with the first row of Table 10, the total 
seasonal duck harvest (K) used in equation (1) was obtained from the Administrative 
 32
Report.  The numbers of hunters differs somewhat in the 2006 Survey, the 2007 
Administrative Report, and state license data.  Estimates of duck hunters from 
Administrative Reports were used to be compatible with harvest and days afield 
information.  Total hunters of all game and participation rates are from the 2006 Survey. 
 
The base case probability (PROB) was estimated as follows.  Daily harvest (B) and days 
afield (DAF) are from the 2007 Administrative Report, and PROB was solved for by 
substituting H and K into equation (1).  The responsiveness (dB/B) of daily harvest (in 
percent) to a one unit change in bag limit (dBL) based on independent research results is 
in Table 10.  It is flyway specific and is shown separately for increases and decreases.  
For example, an increase in the Mississippi Flyway BL from 4 to 5 ducks per day causes 
a 3.5 percent increase in B and a decrease in the BL from 4 to 3 per day causes a 7.9 
percent decrease in B.  To extend the results to more than a unit change in bag limit the 
same rate of change is applied to additional units in either direction, i.e., a change from 4 
to 6 ducks per day yields twice the change in B as a change from 4 to 5. 
 
Estimation of economic effects of alternative frameworks. 
 
Equations 1 through 9 above were rewritten as follows to allow the derivation of the 
economic effects  by flyway of alternative bag limits and season lengths.   
 
-  The change in the probability of duck hunting is equal to change in days afield times 
b/e. 
 
-  The change in daily harvest is equal to the change in days afield divided by J. 
 
-  The change in season harvest is equal to the change in hunter days times the change in 
daily harvest. 
 
-  The change in days afield is equal to the change in season length times the days afield 
divided by the elasticity times the season length. 
 
-  The change in duck hunters is equal to the change in probability of hunting ducks times 
the total number of hunters. 
 
-  The change in hunters days is equal to the days afield plus the change in days afield 
times the change in the number of duck hunters. 
 
-  The change in equipment expenditure is equal to the change in duck hunters times the 
equipment expenditures per hunter. 
 
-  The change in average variable expenditures is equal to the change in duck hunter days 
times average variable expenditures. 
 
-  The change is total expenditures is the sum of the change in equipment expenditures 
plus the change in variable expenditures.
