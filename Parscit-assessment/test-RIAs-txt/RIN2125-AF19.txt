Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis of Proposed Rulemakmg'̂ '"J^; ;̂ l 
Real-Time System Management Information Program 
Section 1201 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) calls for a real-time system management information 
program to provide, in all States, the capability to monitor, in real-time, the traffic and 
travel conditions of the major highways of the United States and to share that 
information to improve the security of the surface transportation system, to address 
congestion problems, to support improved response to weather events and surface 
transportation incidents, and to facilitate national and regional highway traveler 
information. DOT propcses to set the parameters and schedule for implementing this 
Real-Time System Management Information Program through rulemaking. 
This document presents a detailed analysis of costs and a high level analysis of benefits 
from compliance with the proposed rule that would require: 
• the States corresponding to the 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) 
to begin establishing metropolitan real-time information programs including 
travel time information on Interstates within two years of publication of the final 
rule; 
• ail States to establish statewide real-time information programs including 
roadway and lane closure, construction zone, and roadway weather conditions 
information on all Interstates including those in small urban and non-urban areas 
within two years of publication of the final rule; 
• all 50 States and the District of Columbia to update their regional architectures 
within two years of publication of the final rule to reflect the deployment of real-
time information program systems. 
The scope of this document is the two-year period following the publication of the final 
rule. As of this writing, it is estimated that the final rule will be published in 2009, so the 
benefits and costs are estimated from 2011. It is noted that this benefits and costs 
assessment do not articulate the requirements of the proposed rule that are to be 
completed within the four-year span following publication of the final rule. Since the 
States self select the facilities to be monitored within the four-year period, it is not 
possible to determine a reasonable assessment of those additional costs and benefits. 
This document also estimates costs of operating and maintaining real-time information 
programs serving statevv'ide and metropolitan areas through 2019. This period would 
reflect the establishment of real-time information programs by the end of 2011, plus a 
seven-year period of operation. The seven-year period of operation assumes that 
equipment and supporting material for the real-time information program is fully 
replaceable after the operational life cycle. 
The seven-year period of operation applied to this benefit cost analysis results from the 
following statement in the NPRM: 
- 1-
There is no requirement for a State to apply any particular technology, any 
particular technology-dependent application, or any particular business 
approach for establishing a real-time information program. States and other 
public agencies instead are encouraged to consider any salient technology, 
technology-dependent application and business approach options that yield 
information products consistent with the requirements set forth in this proposed 
rule. 
This establishes substantial uncertainty in approaching a cost estimation methodology, as 
the method of generating the data typically carries a specific period of operation after 
which there is a need for full replacement. As will be described further in this analysis, 
the cost estimation methodology is based on an assumption of inductive loop systems 
which are commonly used as in-pavement loop detectors for measuring vehicle presence 
on a roadway lane. This assumption in no way suggests a preference on the part of the 
Department for generating data. Instead, this approach enabled the cost estimation to 
proceed based on what is popularly viewed as among the most expensive option for 
generating data. 
The period of operation for inductive loop surveillance is identified as five years in a 
2004 report titled "Guidelines for Transportation Management Systems Maintenance 
Concept and Plans", FHWA Report No. FHWA-OP-04-011.' However, in light of the 
range of technologies that may be applied, some with an operational lifetime often years, 
others with twenty years, a seven year operational lifetime appears to be a reasonable 
assumption. The actual operational lifetime experienced by a State would depend on 
what is implemented, how it is implemented and maintained, and the operational 
environment. 
Section 1201 of SAFETEA-LU also requires DOT to set data exchange formats for real-
time information programs. The exchange formats are the subject of a separate Interim 
Guidance^. Therefore, the costs of compliance with that rule are not included here. 
This Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis considers the costs and benefits associated with 
establishing real-time information as described in §511.309 and §511.311 within a two-
year time period. It is recognized that §511.311(d) identifies that metropolitan areas may 
define "Routes of significance" which will be under the coverage of a real-time 
information program within a four-year time period. The costs and benefits associated 
with implementation of §511.311(d) is not considered in this analysis because the 
"Routes of significance ' are an unknown quantity. 
This Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis is organized in the following manner:

The FHWA requests comments on the economic analysis of these proposed regulations 
including appropriateness of using the Georgia NaviGAtor study in the ' 'Regulatory Cost 
Analysis of Proposed Rulemaking" to estimate benefits. Comments, including those 
from the State DOTs, regarding specific burdens, impacts, costs, and cost-effective use of 
limited resources would be most welcome and would aid us in more fully appreciating 
the impacts of substantially increasing the real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities 
nationwide. FHWA requests comments from State DOT's and others regarding how they 
anticipate they will comply with these proposed regulations, including the technologies to 
be used and the estimated cost per center-line mile. Hence, we encourage comments on 
all facets of this proposal regarding its costs, burdens, and impacts. 
A. ANALYTICAL APPROACH 
This section of the Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis considers the scope of 
implementing the real-time information program, and the compliance costs for States 
corresponding to the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) 
were considered in this approach because of the geographic and spatial consistency of 
reported data obtained from a variety of sources. 
The costs for establishing a real-time information program, updating a regional 
architecture, and operating/maintaining a real-time information program are presented 
separately. 
Establishing a real-time information program in 50 largest MSAs: 
A real-time inforraation program monitors the transportation system operations in a 
metropolitan area according to the coverage, accuracy, and currency parameters 
defined in this proposed rule. For metropolitan areas, the proposed rule would 
require that travel speeds on Interstate sections be reported with 85% accuracy, 
updated every 10 minutes. The cost of establishing a real-time information 
program in a metiopolitan area depends to a large extent upon the existing real time 
monitoring and reporting capabilities. Based on data from the Intelligent 
Transportation Systems Deployment tracking program [see 
www.itsdeployment.its.dot.govl. the Texas Transportation Institute [see 
http://mobility.ta)'nu.edu1 and the 511 Deployment coalition [see 
^ U.S. Department Of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Washington, D.C., Consumer Price Index

- 3 -
www.deploys 1 l.orjal regarding existing capabilities, the 50 relevant MSAs can be 
categorized as high, medium, or low cost to establish a real-time information 
program. 
Establishing a statewide real-time information program: 
Outside metropolitan areas, the parameters for a real-time information program 
would require monitored information to be updated every 20 minutes. Real time 
travel speed information would be excluded from real-time information programs 
applied outside the metropolitan areas. Significant additional monitoring will 
likely not be required for coverage of non-metropolitan area roads. Therefore, the 
effort to establish a real-time information program for non-metropolitan areas is 
regarded as analogous to setting up a statewide 511 traveler information system"* or 
updating an existing one. Costs of existing statewide 511 systems are used as the 
basis for that cost estimate. 
Updating regional architectures: 
The level of effort required to update a regional ITS architecture, as defined by a 
State and/or a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) is estimated to be 
roughly a quarter of the effort required to initially develop a regional architecture. 
Costs of regional architecture development from the Preliminary Regulatory 
Evaluation that accompanied the rulemaking that resulted in 23 CFR 940 were used 
as the basis for that cost estimate^. 
Operations and maintenance: 
The estimated operating/maintenance costs of the real-time information program 
would be 10% of the initial capital and labor required to establish the program in a 
given region. This estimate is based upon case studies of existing 511 traveler 
information systems and generally accepted systems engineering principles. 
B. COST ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 
The following four principal categories of compliance cost were estimated for the 
NPRM: 
• Cost of establishing a real-time information program in the 50 largest MSAs 
within two years of publication of the final rule, including travel speeds updated 
every 10 minutes; 
^ In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission designated "511" as the national number for traveler 
information. 511 systems provide traveler information via phone and websites in many states. More 
information is available at the following URL: http.7/www.deplov511 .org. 
^ The Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation document was part of FHWA Docket No. FHWA-1999-5899. 
This is available at the following URL: http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf47/82833_web.pdf

• Cost of establishing a real-time information program statewide within two years 
of publication of the final rule; including travel and weather information updated 
every 20 minutes; 
• Annual operating and maintenance costs for a real-time information program 
(statewide and metropolitan area); 
• Cost of updating regional architectures to include the establishment of a real-time 
information program. 
B.l Cost Estimation Methodology for Establishing a Real-Time Information 
Program in the 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas 
Cost data from existing 511 deployments, as well as costs of additional freeway 
monitoring to meet the requirements of this proposed rule, were used to estimate the cost 
of compliance with the NPRM's requirements in the 50 largest MSAs. Data from the 
U.S. DOT ITS Joint Program Office and from the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) 
were used to estimate the costs of establishing a real-time information program. Low, 
medium, and high cost estimates are provided based on the suitability of existing 
monitoring capabilities to meet real-time information program requirements. 
The cost of a real-time information program as described in the proposed rule is 
considered to be analogous to the cost of creating a new 511 system, or upgrading an 
existing 511 system. In the medium and high cost cases, this also involves improving the 
geographic coverage, content, and currency of the data collection feeding the 511 system. 
More than half of the 50 of the largest metro areas already have some 511 system in 
place, so an estimate of the cost of starting from "zero" is relevant only for a few of the 
high cost cities. The cost of improved monitoring of data on real-time traffic and travel 
conditions, particularly traffic speed information, on Interstates represents the largest 
proportion of the estimated cost. 
Based on deployment data from the 2005 ITS Deployment Tracking Survey^ and the TTI 
Urban Mobility Studies, a national cost estimate was developed for deploying real-time 
information programs in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Seven cities were determined 
to be low cost because they are close to meeting the proposed real-time information 
program characteristics. Eleven cities were determined to be medium cost because they 
possess some monitoring on more than half of the freeway miles and they already operate 
a 511 system and/or traveler information Web sites. Thirty-two cities were determined to 
be high cost because they have limited freeway monitoring and thus have a restricted 
amount of information ';o share via a 511 system. 
Data on freeway miles under surveillance as reported by the Metropolitan Areas to researchers from the 
Oakridge National Laboratory in 2005 is available at http://www.itsdeploYment.its.dot.gov. "Freeway 
surveillance" is the term used by this source for "the capability to monitor" as referred to in section 1201 of 
SAFETEA-LU 
' The Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) conducts mobility studies and issues reports annually on their 
findings. The 2005 report is available at the following URL: http://mobilitv.tamu.edu/ums/report/ 
- 5 -
Multiplying the low, medium, or high estimates by 50 to derive a nationwide estimate 
would not be a realistic estimate, as the conditions for the "low" estimate (existing 
system is close to compliance with the proposed rule) do not apply to all 50 metropolitan 
areas, nor do the "high" conditions (existing monitoring/data collection is not close to 
compliance with the proposed rule) apply to all 50 metropolitan areas. 
Information on current monitoring capability was not found for four of the metropolitan 
areas [Memphis, Richmond, Birmingham, and Rochester], and thus were assumed to be 
high cost. 
The national estimate was made by assigning 7 cities as low, 11 as medium, and 32 as 
high costs based on actual deployment status of relevant components of a real-time 
information program. Total number of Interstate miles per city and deployment status 
was determined from the 2005 ITS Deployment Tracking Survey and the TTI Urban 
Mobility Studies; 
• "low" cost cities have more than 80% of Interstate miles in the MSA currently 
monitored, 
• "medium" cost cities have 50-80% of Interstate miles being monitored, and 
• "high" cost cities have fewer than 50% of Interstate miles being monitored. 
B.2 Cost Estimation Methodology for Establishing a Statewide Real-Time 
Information Program in all 50 States 
The NPRM requirements for real-time information programs outside metropolitan areas 
would include construction and weather information, but not real time travel speeds on 
Interstates. Therefore, new monitoring requirements are likely to be minimal in most 
States; the primary cost will be formatting the information in standard formats and 
providing it to the public and other public sector agencies via the 511 system and the 
Internet. Establishing a real-time information program in a State would be analogous to 
the cost of a major update of a statewide 511 system. Most States already have 511 
systems in place or will by the end of 2008.^ Based on the cost of a major update of an 
existing 511 system in Arizona, the estimated cost for these deployments is $1.51 million 
per State. ̂  This does not include the additional cost of metro coverage in that State, so 
the total cost of the program presented later is the sum of metro area and statewide costs. 
The real-time information program would include monitoring certain types of real time 
information and pro\ iding "the capability and means to share that data with State and 
local governments and the traveling public." The assumption is that real-time 
information program data will be used by existing 511 systems and incident management 
This claim appears in the following URLs: http://www.deploy511 .org/deploystatus.htm OR 
http://www.fhwa.dot.gOv/trafficinfo/511 .htm. The statistics provided are used to represent the network and 
deployment for the Metropolitan Statistical Areas in question. It was found that they are based upon the 
similar but slightly different Metropolitan Planning Area boundaries for each region.

Analysis Report Model Deployment of a Regional, Multi-Modal 511 Traveler Information System"

systems, as well as other applications. However, the NPRM does not include 
requirements for any particular applications of the monitored information beyond basic 
511 and inter-agency information sharing. Therefore, costs of other possible applications 
using the monitored data are not included here. 
The District of Columbia is assumed to be covered by the real-time information program 
for the DC MSA, so there is not a separate statewide cost for DC. 
B.3 Cost Estimation Methodology for Operating and Maintaining a Real-Time 
Information Program for Seven Years in the 50 Largest Metro Areas 
Based on analysis of annual costs for existing 511 systems, operations and maintenance 
costs were estimated at 10% of original deployment costs per year. Annual costs include 
costs for 511 telecommunications, labor, and equipment replacement. 
B.4 Cost Estimation Methodology for Updating a Regional ITS Architecture 
An analysis of the cost of developing a regional ITS architecture was developed as part of 
this Regulatory Cost Analysis accompanying the rulemaking that resulted in 23 CFR 940. 
As part of that analysis, the cost of developing a regional architecture "from scratch" for 
a large metropolitan area was estimated to be $100,000 on average in 2000 dollars, or 
$109,698 in 2004 dollars. The cost was based on a survey of staff from impacted 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). An update should require no more than a 
quarter as much effort as the original development, given that much of the needed 
stakeholder coordination should already be in place from the initial architecture 
development process. R<iflecting a new real-time information program should require a 
relatively modest modification to an existing architecture. 
C. BENEFITS ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 
The effects of establishing a real-time information program include both quantitative and 
qualitative benefits to th<i general commuting public, the environment, as well as to the 
subset of traveler who ac-tively acquire and use traffic information. 
The methodology applied to estimate mobility, safety, and environmental benefits from 
the establishment of a real-time information program is based on the outcome of a 
comprehensive evaluation conducted in the Atlanta metropolitan region of the Georgia 
NaviGAtor system.'° 
The Georgia NaviGAtor system has deployed extensive monitoring on 150+ miles of 
Interstate and freeways in order to provide traveler information and to improve freeway 
management and incident management. The evaluation of the system measured the

incident delay savings, emissions reductions, fuel savings, and secondary crash reduction 
savings from quicker incident detection, response, and clearance through the use of the 
NaviGAtor system. The analysis of the Georgia NaviGAtor system is particularly 
thorough in that it used actual incident logs to determine benefits. 
The findings from the NaviGAtor system were extrapolated to the 49 other metropolitan 
regions that would be subject to this proposed rule. 
The Georgia NaviGAtor estimation methodology applied a number of region-specific 
variables including the percentage of truck traffic on the highways, personal vehicle 
occupancy rate, the cost per hour per person for time spent in travel, the cost per hour per 
truck for time spent in travel, the personal and commercial vehicle fuel consumption 
rates, the cost of gasoline and diesel, and the average cost of a two-vehicle property-
damage-only crash. In computing the benefits for the 50 largest metropolitan regions, the 
values of these variables were adjusted to reflect national averages and 2005 Vehicle 
Miles Traveled data was used. 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed regarding the percentage of delay reduction 
attributable to the advanced information system versus the "Hero" safety patrols 
deployed on Atlanta's freeways. First, the benefits were calculated assuming that 1/3 of 
the delay reduction was directly attributable to the advanced information system. 
Second, the benefits were calculated assuming that only 1/10 of the delay reduction was 
directly attributable to the advanced information system. 
D. ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE BENEFITS AND COSTS 
OF THE REAL-TIME INFORMATION PROGRAM 
This section provides details of the specific assumptions and details of calculation 
methods used to estimate the proposed rule's compliance costs and benefits. The benefit-
cost analysis provided here applies the general principles described in Circular No. A-94, 
"Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs" issued 
by the Office of Management and Budget in Executive Office of the President." 
Preliminary assessment of benefits and costs, applying a Net Present Value Base Case 
Analysis, in which there is an assumed real discount rate of 7 percent. 
D.l Cost of Establishing a Real-Time Information Program in Metropolitan 
Areas 
The cost of establishing a real-time information program was based on known costs for 
existing 511 systems, \\'ith additional freeway monitoring and data fusion costs estimated 
for the "medium" and "high" parts of the range. 
' ' The contents of Circular No. A-94 are available at the following URL: 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a094/a094.html 
The cost elements include labor, equipment, marketing/outreach, standards compliance, 
and telecommunications for the 511 system. Additional data needed beyond existing 
systems in place may be achieved through new data monitoring infrastructure or by 
purchasing data from the private sector. All 50 metropolitan areas have multiple private 
sector traveler information data providers.'"^ 
Based on data from the ITS Deployment Tracking Program, 7 of the 50 largest MSAs 
already have monitoring on at least 80% of freeway miles and already have 511 and are 
thus assumed to have "low" cost to establish a real-time information program. Eleven 
MSAs have monitoring on 50-80% of freeway miles and are thus assumed to have 
"medium" costs to establish a real-time information program. Four smaller cities where 
data on existing monitoring is not available are also assumed to have "high" cost. Thirty-
two MSAs have monitoring in place on fewer than 50% of freeway miles and will require 
"high" costs to establish a real-time information program. 
Since the cost of additional freeway monitoring is much greater than the cost of setting 
up a 511 system, based on existing case studies, the main determinant of cost to establish 
a real-time information program would be the extent and quality of the existing 
monitoring network. All 50 cities have multiple private sector real-time information data 
providers, so cities may be able to purchase additional data to establish a real-time 
information program more quickly, but not necessarily at lower cost.'"' 
D. 1 • 1 Cost for "low" cities that already have 511 and monitoring on 80% of freeway 
miles 
For these low cost cities, the estimated cost is the cost of minor upgrades to the existing 
511 system in terms of data content, currency, and accuracy. The upgrades may be 
achieved through either additional monitoring by the State DOT or purchase of data from 
the private sector. 
The cost of additional monitoring is assumed to be $76,789'"^ per freeway mile, with an 
average of 32 miles to be upgraded. 
'̂  Including but not limited to Navteq, Inrix, XMNavTraffic, and Westwood One. More than half of the 50 
cities have received or will receive funding through the Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure Program 
(ITEP), which should accelerate the availability of high quality real time travel information by private sector 
providers. Please see the lasi section of this cost analysis for a discussion of issues and opportunities for 
private sector data. More information on the ITIP Program is available at the following URL: 
http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/travelinfo/ttidprogram/ttidprogram.htm 
'"* It is possible that private sector probe data will be cheaper and more accurate than current monitoring 
technologies, but we have no data on how much cheaper or more accurate as these probe data technologies 
are not yet widely deployed in the U.S. 
'* This cost is based on estimates from Business Models and Cost Considerations for 511 Deployment, a 
2002 report on 511 deployment costs, which assumed that the monitoring was done with loop detectors, 
video, CCTV, and/or microv/ave sensors. The cost per mile for those technologies range from $29,000 to 
$70,000 per mile per technology, including systems integration and installation costs, but not backhaul 
telecommunications. Other probe data technologies not available in 2002 could cost significantly less, but 
that has not been proven. The 2002 costs represent a reasonable, conservative estimate of freeway

Per city: 
Upgrade to 511 and Web site to include 1201 information = $1,512,040.'^ 
Additional data collection/purchase ($76,789/mi * 32 mi) = $2,530,038. 
Total for seven "low" cities at $3.97 million each = $27.78 million. 
D. 1.2 Cost for "medium" cities that have monitoring on 50-80% of freeway miles and 
limited 511 capabilities 
Each of these 11 cities have existing public sector 511 phone systems and/or traveler 
information websites, but not necessarily with all of the information content, quality, and 
currency that would be required by the proposed rule. For these cities, the estimated cost 
includes major upgrades to the existing 511 and Web site, and significant additional 
monitoring. The upgrades may be achieved through either additional monitoring by the 
State DOT or purchase of data from the private sector. 
The cost of additional monitoring is assumed to be $76,789 per freeway mile''', with an 
I Q 
average of 149 miles to be upgraded. 
As noted earlier, the average of 149 miles of additional monitoring needed is based on 
data from 11 cities for which deployment status data is available.

Total for "medium" cities: = $142.49 million 
D. 1.3 Cost for "high" cost cities that have monitoring on less than 50% of freeway miles 
Fewer than half of these 32 cities already have 511 systems, and the existing ones tend to 
be statewide road closure Web sites that are updated infrequently and appear to lack the 
characteristics for a real-time information program defined in this rule. Therefore, the 
cost estimate is based on the cost of new 511 systems for major metro areas. 
Per city: 
New 511 systems = $1,995,053 each^° 
Additional monitoring is assumed to be $76,789 per freeway mile, with an average of 230 
additional miles^' to be monitored = $17.66 million each. 
Total: 
32 new 511 systems at $1.99 million each = $63.84 million 
32 cities of freeway monitoring upgrades at $17.66 million each = $565.16 million 
Total for "high" cities == $629.01 million 
D.l Cost of Establishing Statewide Real-Time Information Programs 
Fifty States will be required to establish statewide real-time information programs that 
provide construction and weather information, including road closures, but not real time 
travel speed information. The entirety of the District of Columbia would be covered by 
the metro system for that area, so a separate statewide system would not be required. The 
assumption is that for statewide systems, monitoring can be obtained from existing 
systems used for other purposes. For example, existing road weather monitoring station 
system could be used to provide real time weather information to travelers, and existing 
work zone management systems could be used to provide road closure information. The 
cost of establishing a statewide real-time information program is assumed to be similar to 
that of implementing a 511 system in a State. 
The average cost of new statewide 511 systems is about $2.2 million, including 
plarming, implementation, and the first year of operations and maintenance (in 2002

dollars). [This is not much more than the cost of a new metro system from the previous 
section. Costs of new statewide and metro 511 systems are quite similar, since most of 
the cost of a 511 system is for disseminating information rather than collecting it.] 
However, most States already have a 511 system in place or will by the end of 2007."^ 
Therefore, the cost of establishing a statewide real-time information program should be 
analogous to an update of an existing statewide 511 system, or $1.51 million'"* (in 2004 
dollars). 
Estimated cost of implementing real-time information programs in states: 
50 States times $1.51 million = $75.62 million 
D.3 Cost of Maintaining and Operating a Real-time Information Program 
Based on case studies of existing 511 systems, the maintenance and operating costs for 
1201 are assumed to be 10% of the cost of the original implementation each year. This 
estimate covers labor to maintain the system and replacement hardware and software. If 
the metro area chooses to purchase data from private sector providers, or an entire 
turnkey system, the annual cost would be the license fee from that vendor. 
Based on the estimates in sections 1 and 2, the total cost of establishing real-time 
information programs in all 50 major cities plus statewide systems is about $804 million. 
An operations and maintenance cost of ten percent would be $80 million per year 
nationwide. 
Costs of maintaining expanded metro systems are not included, as the schedule for 
deployment of expanded coverage will be determined by cost-constrained state plans. 
D.4 Cost of Updating a Regional Architecture to Include a Real-Time 
Information Program 
The universe of planning organizations impacted by the NPRM is taken as 50 State 
DOTs, plus the District of Columbia. The cost of updating a regional architecture to 
include the real-time information program was considered to be one quarter the cost of 
developing such architecture in the first place. Given that some of the stakeholder 
coordination should already be in place from the architecture development process, it 
seems reasonable to assuime that updating the architecture should be no more than a 
quarter of the effort of developing the original architecture. 
The estimated cost of developing a regional architecture, from the Regulatory Evaluation 
accompanying the architecture rule, is $100,000. That number was based on a survey of 
planning staff at State DOTs and MPOs circa 1999. It is reasonable to presume that those

"* This cost is based on costs of an actual upgrade to an existing 511 deployment in Arizona (Interim 
Analysis Report Model Deployment of a Regional, Multi-Modal 511 Traveler Information System),

locations that have established a regional architecture would have continued to maintain 
the fidelity of the architecture to reflect cuirent transportation operations. Assuming that 
the regional architecture is properly maintained, it would be a relatively small effort to 
complete an update to include enhanced real-time information programs. Therefore, 
adjusting to 2004 constant dollars, the estimate for updating the architecture to include a 
real-time information program is $27,425, or a quarter of the cost to create a new regional 
architecture. 
Nationwide estimate: $27,425 times 50 States -t- DC = $1,399 million 
The architecture should be updated as part of the planning process for implementing the 
system. The systems are assumed to be implemented by the end of 2010. The total costs 
are discounted, for purjioses of this analysis, to 2008 as the base year.

D.6 Benefits to Travelers from Real-Time Information Programs 
The effects of real-time information program deployments include both quantitative and 
qualitative benefits to the general commuting public, the environment, as well as to the 
subset of traveler who actively acquire and use traffic information. The methodology 
- 13-
applied to estimate mobility, safety, and environmental benefits from establishing a real-
time information program is based on the outcome of a comprehensive evaluation 
conducted in the Atlanta metropolitan region of the Georgia NaviGAtor system. This 
evaluation measured the incident delay savings, emissions reductions, fuel savings, and 
secondary crash reduction savings from quicker incident detection, response, and 
clearance through the use of the NaviGAtor system. Findings from the NaviGAtor system 
were extrapolated to the 49 other metropolitan region. The outcome from this estimation 
process is summarized in Table 1 in annual cost savings from a fully established real-time 
information program in the 50 largest metropolitan regions. 
The Georgia NaviGAtor system includes both advanced information systems (detection 
and communication) and a roadside "Hero" program of quick response vehicles deployed 
on the freeway system. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were performed to examine how 
the benefits would change if only 1/3 and 1/10 of the delay reductions shown were due to 
the advanced information system.

A previous evaluation of the Atlanta Navigator found that a little over 1/3 of the 
reduction in a typical incident duration was due to incident detection and, verification, 
and dispatch (mostly advanced infomiation) and a little less than 2/3 due to reaching the 
location after dispatch and clearance once at the location^^. Sensitivity Analysis 1 (1/3 
attributable to information systems) causes a 67% reduction in the total savings, and 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 (1/10 attributable to information systems) causes a 90% reduction 
in totals savings. Both still produce a B/C ratio greater than 1. 
The Georgia NaviGAtor estimation methodology applied a number of region-specific 
variables including the percentage of truck traffic on the highways, personal vehicle 
occupancy rate, the cost p(;r hour per person for time spent in travel, the cost per hour per 
truck for time spend in travel, the personal and commercial vehicle fuel consumption 
rates, the cost of gasoline .ind diesel, and the average cost of a two-vehicle property-
damage-only crash. In coimputing the benefits for the 50 largest metropolitan regions, the 
values of these variables v/ere adjusted to reflect national averages. The Georgia-specific 
values and the national average values are listed in Table 2 with sources for the national 
values. 
The Georgia NaviGAtor study is based on 141 centerline miles of freeway coverage, 
however there are 342 centerline miles of freeway in the Atlanta metropolitan region. 
Therefore, benefits were adjusted to reflect a full real-time information program in the 
Atlanta metropolitan region. Furthermore, the national variables for the cost per hour per 
person for time spent in travel, the cost per hour per truck for time spend in travel, the 
personal and commercial vehicle fuel consumption rates, and the cost of gasoline and 
diesel were replaced in the Georgia NaviGAtor study and benefits were recomputed. 
These replacements were made to reflect more recent and nationally appropriate values. 
Given the absence of region-specific incident counts, the rate of incidents as a function of 
freeway vehicle-miles traveled in the Atlanta metropolitan region was applied to the other 
49 regions. Consequently, a region with double the annual freeway vehicle-miles 
traveled in Atlanta is estimated to incur double the cost savings from a fully established 
real-time information program in that region. The daily vehicle miles of travel on 
Interstate, other freeways and expressways was acquired from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation report "Highway Statistics 2005.""^ The specific methodology applied by 
the Georgia NavGAtor study is presented in the report "Benefits Analysis for the Georgia 
Department of Transpon:ation NaviGAtor Program. ^"

Table 2. Variables Applied in Calculation of Benefits 
It is important to note that these benefits reflect delay savings resulting from improved 
response to non-recurring events. The authors of the NaviGAtor Program study admit 
that total benefits estimation was not possible under their study. 
17 
"the NaviGAtor website (www.georgia-navigator.com) currently registers 
over half a million visits per month, clearly indicating that Georgians derive a 
significant benefit from the content (images, travel times, incident info, etc.) 
that it provides. Attempting to quantify the benefits of the NaviGAtor website 
and other Advance Transportation Information Systems (ATIS), such as the 
Changeable Message Signs and the *DOT phone service is very complex; 
however, cmd was not included in this analysis. " 
The benefits estimation does not include traveler information user benefits experienced 
by routine users of the system to adjust trip time and route in the form of enhanced trip 
reliability. 
Additionally, the establishment of a real-time information program will greatly facilitate 
and enhance a score of othier functionalities such as evacuation planning and 
implementation, infrastructure maintenance, or motorist assistance operations. These 
types of benefits, althoughi significant and substantial, are not yet fully quantified through 
field evaluation either due to their inherent difficulty of assessment or cost of evaluation. 
Reduced congestion from even a small percentage of travelers shifting time or route 
based on real-time information could yield additional benefits to all travelers that cannot 
be reliably estimated at this time, including reduced costs for new road construction and 
fewer police-reported accidents. Qualitative "quality of life" benefits might accrue to 
individual travelers, including reduced stress and ability to avoid congestion by 
rescheduling discretionary trips. These qualitative benefits are not included in this 
analysis. Therefore, the actual benefit of real-time information programs will likely be 
higher than is estimated here. 
The Net Present Value of the estimated costs and benefits (excluding expanded 
coverage) through 2018 represents a $28.98 billion surplus to American travelers 
and taxpayers (B/C = 24.7). Even if only 1/3 of the total delay reduction found in the 
Atlanta Navigator studj' is used for the calculation there is a Net Present Value of 
$8.84 Billion (B/C = 8.2). If a conservative 1/10 of the total delay reduction found in 
Atlanta is used the Net Present Value is still $1.80 billion (B/C = 2.5). 
This estimate is subject to change, as it is likely some cities will not have full monitoring 
in place by 2010, so initial deployment costs and subsequent maintenance costs will be 
spread over a longer period. Table 1 shows that the additional monitoring will accrue a 
national societal benefit valued at $5.79 billion per year for all 50 cities beginning in 
2010. If the deployment is delayed, the benefits will consequently be reduced, but the 
NPV will still be positive number. The benefit estimate is conservative, as it is only for 
system level benefits due; to reduced delay from faster incident detection and clearance; 
total benefits including benefits to individual travelers from increased travel time 
reliability could be an order of magnitude greater. 
E. STATEMENT ON THE ANALYSIS 
18 
This Regulatory Benefit-C'osts Analysis was prepared to satisfy Executive Order No. 
12866. The order states that each agency shall assess both the costs and the benefits of 
the intended regulation and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to 
quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the 
benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. 
It is recognized that there are several sources of uncertainty introduced in this analysis. 
The costs estimation is acknowledged to be based upon a program in which inductive 
loop surveillance is the means for producing real-time information. This was done in 
order to avoid underestimating a "high" cost for fully establishing real-time information 
programs in each metropolitan area and each State. Technological advances and the 
market for information service providers evolve rapidly, allowing more cost effective 
approaches to be implemented. 
The benefits analysis is dependent upon an extrapolation of the assessed delay-reducing 
impacts of the Georgia NaviGAtor system. It is clear that there is substantial value in the 
active management of the nation's transportation assets. The challenge here is to 
attribute the societal benefits that accrue specifically from the provision of real-time 
information. It is widely acknowledged that the provision of real-time information 
enables travelers to make more informed decisions, which allows for more reliable travel. 
The delay-reducing opportunity from real-time information enables one to quantify its 
inherent "value." That value is likely to vary in quality in different areas of the country 
because of characteristics such as physical features, climatic characteristics, crash rate, 
presence of traffic and travel conditions data generation, and exposure of travelers to 
information dissemiucition media. 
The evaluation variables are highly sensitive to geography. Pollution damage per ton, for 
instance, is known to vary with location. The valuation of pollution damage per ton is 
varied, and multiple sources express a broad range of values for estimating the total 
impact. For the final rule on the Real-Time System Management Information Program, 
the FHWA intends to apply the same value for emissions damage valuation as used in 
upcoming National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy (CAFE) rulemaking. The prevention of fatalities and injuries also will 
vary based on the amount of delay per lane mile generated by local traffic conditions. 
What is clear is that further empirical evidence, collected over a long time span, will shed 
a more accurate light on the full value of real-time information programs. The evidence 
at hand appears to indic£ite that there is a positive benefit-cost ratio attributed to the 
implementation of this mle. It is acknowledged, however, that there is a limited 
possibility that the costs could exceed the benefits. 
States and other reviewers of this regulatory benefit-cost analysis are invited to submit 
comments on sources and techniques (such as simulation and modeling) that are not 
indicated here, but otherwise would be valuable for a more in-depth regulatory benefit-
cost analysis.
