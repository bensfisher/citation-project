Executive Summary 
 
Under Executive Order 12866, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is required to conduct 
an analysis of the costs, benefits, and other impacts for a significant rulemaking. We expect 
this rulemaking to be economically significant (i.e., the rulemaking would have an annual 
effect on the economy of $100 million or more). This preliminary Regulatory Analysis (RA) 
provides supporting documentation for the regulatory evaluation in the preamble of the 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for Standards for Living Organisms in Ships’ Ballast 
Water Discharged in U.S. Waters [USCG-2001-10486]. We did not attempt to replicate 
precisely the regulatory language of the proposed rule in this RA; the regulatory text, not the 
text of this RA, would be legally binding. 
 
The unintentional introduction of nonindigenous species (NIS) into the waters of the United 
States via the discharge of vessels’ ballast water continues to pose a serious risk to coastal 
facilities and global biodiversity. Current U.S. regulations require ballast water management 
(BWM) to reduce introductions of NIS through ballast water discharge (BWD). Currently, 
the primary management method for controlling ballast water discharged in U.S. waters is a 
mid-ocean exchange of ballast water obtained from waters outside the U.S. Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ). Concern remains that this approach to ballast water management is 
not sufficiently effective in preventing the introduction of NIS nor can many vessels conduct 
ballast water exchange because of safety issues and or voyage constraints.  
 
The U.S. is proposing a rule to establish a ballast water discharge standard (BWDS) for the 
allowable concentrations of living organisms discharged via ballast water into U.S. waters. 
While it has been adopted by the International Maritime Organization, it has not been ratified 
by enough countries to bring it into force as an international requirement.  The Coast Guard 
expects this to eventually be ratified. This rulemaking is consistent with the IMO proposed 
BWDS under the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ship’s Ballast 
Water and Sediments (also known as BWM Convention) of February 2004..  
 
This RA provides an evaluation of the economic impacts associated with the implementation 
of standards limiting the quantities of living organisms in vessels’ ballast water discharged in 
U.S. waters. The focus of this assessment is to analyze the costs and benefits of 
implementing the proposed IMO standard (Alternative 2). We considered the following five 
alternative standards for this rulemaking: 
Alternative 1: No Action 
The No Action Alternative (NAA) would not establish a BWDS but would continue the 
existing BWM program. As currently framed, the mandatory BWM program, established in 
2004, directs vessels to conduct mid-ocean exchange, retain ballast water onboard, or use an 
environmentally sound management method approved by the USCG.

Alternatives 2-4: Ballast Water Discharge Concentrations 
Under Alternatives 2-4, maximum discharge concentrations for viable organisms would be 
established. Each of these alternatives are stated in terms of two different organism size 
classes and the number of viable organisms per volume discharged for each size class. A 
third class, microorganisms, is specified in terms of indicator bacteria and the number of 
colony forming units (cfu) per 100 milliliters (ml). The standard becomes progressively more 
stringent from Alternative 2 to Alternative 4 (Alternatives 3 and 4 are 10 times and 100 times 
more stringent than Alternative 2, respectively). Alternative 2 is considered the preferred 
alternative and analyzed in the depth in this RA. Table ES-1 shows the concentrations of 
organisms allowed under each alternative.

100 ml 
<33 cfu per 
100 ml 
 
Alternative 5: Essentially Sterilization 
Alternative 5 would require the removal or inactivation of all living membrane-bound 
organisms (including bacteria and some viruses) larger than 0.1 micron. 
Population Affected 
This rule will affect vessels operating in U.S waters1 equipped with ballast tanks. These 
vessels are required to install and operate a USCG approved ballast water management 
system (BWMS) before discharging ballast water into U.S. waters. This would include 
vessels bound for offshore ports or places. Additionally, whether the vessel traveled 200 
nautical miles offshore is not a factor in determining applicability. This means that some 
vessels that operated exclusively in the coastwise trade (within the EEZ), which were 
previously exempt from having to perform BWE, would now be required to meet the BWDS.  
 
The primary source of data used in this analysis is the Marine Information for Safety and 
Law Enforcement (MISLE) system and Ballast Water Reporting Forms submitted to the 
                                                 
1 Waters of the United States  means waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as defined in 33 CFR 
2.3, including the navigable waters of the United States. For 33 CFR Part 151, subpart C and D, the navigable 
waters include the territorial sea as extended to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, pursuant to Presidential 
Proclamation No. 5928 of December 27, 1988.

National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC). MISLE is the USCG database system 
for information on vessel characteristics, arrivals, casualties, and inspections. The NBIC 
database, which is maintained by the Smithsonian and provides information on the amount of 
ballast water discharged in U.S. ports for the range of vessel types calling on U.S. waters. 
Since October 2004, all vessels, U.S. and foreign, operating in U.S. waters and bound for 
U.S. ports or places must submit reports of their BWM practices to the NBIC database. 33 
CFR 151.2041.  
 
Approximately 7,575 vessels from the current vessel population, of which 2,616 are U.S. 
vessels, would be required to meet the BWDS.  Full implementation is required by 2016.  
The installation requirements are phased-in for new and existing vessels over the 2012 
through 2016 period. Table ES-2 presents the number of potential vessels operating in U.S. 
waters that would be covered under the proposed BWDS.

This rulemaking is consistent with the IMO proposed BWDS under the International 
Convention for the Control and Management of Ship’s Ballast Water and Sediments (also 
known as BWM Convention) of February 2004.  For the purposes of this RA, we consider 
the bottom-line costs of this rulemaking to involve U.S. vessels only. Nevertheless, we 
anticipate that the development of treatment technology will involve the world fleet, not the 
U.S. fleet alone.  Also, for the purpose of this rulemaking we do consider all vessels 
operating in U.S. waters when developing the average per vessel installation and operating 
unit costs since the U.S. fleet is relatively small and not representative of all vessel types. 
 
Costs of Alternative Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
The IMO BWM Convention has spurred development of alternative ballast water 
management systems (BWMS) that will enable vessels to meet the IMO discharge standard 
(Alternative 2). Various technologies are being evaluated. Shipboard trials are being 
conducted for some of these technologies, while other systems are undergoing land-based 
laboratory testing.  
Not all systems are appropriate for all vessel types. Estimated annual operating costs for a 
BWMS is 2 to 4 times the cost for ballast water management using mid-ocean BWE. The 
increased operational costs relate, in part, to the use of chemicals or other agents in the 
BWMS and are also due to the treatment of certain discharges not required under current 
regulations. Cost estimates contain a degree of uncertainty because these emerging 
technologies are in their formative stages. The BWMS on ships is a new process for which 
there is minimal operating practical experience, any discussion of the treatment technologies, 
effectiveness, costs, and operating issues is provisional.  
Approximately 4,758 BWMS installations for the U.S. vessels would be required by 2021 
because of projected fleet growth. We expect highest annual costs in the period between 
2012 and 2016, as all of the existing fleet of vessels must meet the standards according to the 
phase-in schedule proposed by the rule (Table ES-3). The primary cost driver of this 
rulemaking is the installation costs for all existing vessels. After this period, we estimate 
operating costs to be substantially less.   
For the purposes of estimating the total operational cost of BWMS, we multiply the operating 
costs by the proportion of vessels we have estimated to be treating ballast each year. 
However, once a vessel begins treatment of ballast water, their operational cost continues to 
carry-over into the future. Therefore, the total cost of the BWMS during the installation 
period will increase substantially due to the cumulative nature of operating BWMS.

We estimate the first-year total (initial) cost of this rulemaking to be $239 million based on a 
7 percent discount rate and $248 million based on a 3 percent discount rate.  Over the 10-year 
period of analysis (2012-2021), the total cost of Alternative 2 for the U.S. vessels is 
approximately $1.18 billion using the 7 percent discount rate and $1.35 billion using the 3 
percent discount rate. Our cost assessment includes existing and new vessels.  
 
The costs associated with the higher standards of Alternatives 3 and 4 (one-tenth and one-
hundredth of Alternative 2, respectively) are more speculative. Capital and operational costs 
could certainly increase. We estimate the costs for Alternative 3 would be double those for 
Alternative 2, and that the costs for Alternative 4 would be quadruple those for Alternative 2.  
At this time, the most feasible approach for achieving the Alternative 5 (essentially 
sterilization) standard is through the elimination of ballast water discharge. For some vessel 
types, such as large containerships and roll on/roll off vessels, this may be feasible. For other 
vessel types, such as bulk carriers, it is not possible to eliminate discharge of ballast without 
significant reduction in cargo carrying capacity - up to 35 percent of the payload.  
We compared costs of implementing Alternative 2 (the alternative proposed in the NPRM) 
for BWDS to shipping revenues and consumer retail prices for goods typically transported by 
vessels. We have also compared amortized installation costs to long-term charter rates. These 
costs typically represent less than one percent of long-term charter rates. Costs to the 
consumer are further diluted because maritime transportation costs generally represent only 
one to two percent of the retail cost of goods. Although the overall cost of implementing this 
proposed rule is significant, the cost will not be noticeable by the average consumer because 
the costs will have minimal impact on the costs of goods and services.

Economic Costs of Invasions of Non-indigenous Species 
 
NIS introductions contribute to the loss of marine biodiversity and have associated with it 
significant social, economic, and biological impacts. NIS introductions in U.S. waters are 
occurring at increasingly rapid rates. Avoided costs associated with future NIS invasions 
represent one of the benefits of BWM. Economic costs from invasions of NIS range in the 
billions of dollars annually. Evaluation of these impacts was difficult because of limited 
knowledge of the patterns and basic processes that influence marine biodiversity. The most 
extensive review to date on the economic costs of introduced species in the U.S. includes 
estimates for many types of NIS, and is reflected in Table ES-4.  
 
Table ES-4 Estimated Annual Costs of Aquatic Introduced Species ($ 2007) 
Species Costs  
Fish $5.7 billion 
Zebra and Quagga mussels $1.06 billion 
Asiatic clam $1.06 billion 
Aquatic weeds $117 million 
Green Crab $47 million 
Note: See Chapter 5 "Economic Cost of Invasions of Non-indigenous 
Species" for additional details and source information. 
 
 
Though a particular invasion may have small direct economic impacts, the accumulation of 
these events may cost in the billions of dollars every year. Only a few invasions to date have 
led to costs in the billions of dollars per year.  
 
Ballast water discharge is one of the two main vectors by which NIS are introduced into the 
marine environment associated with shipping - hull-fouling being the other. The proposed 
BWDS will not address hull fouling.  The relative impact of ballast water and hull fouling 
vectors has not been fully understood (Ruiz 2002). 
 
 
Benefits of Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
The benefits of BWDS are difficult to quantify because of the complexity of the ecosystem 
and a lack of understanding about the probabilities of invasions based on prescribed levels of 
organisms in ballast water. However, evaluation of costs associated with previous invasions 
(described above) allows a comparison of the cost of discharge standards versus the potential 
costs avoided. Because the amount of shipping traffic and the number of incidents of 
invasions per year are both increasing, historical data provide a lower bound for the basis of 
benefit evaluation.  
 
We assessed the functional benefits prior to comparing monetary benefit measures. The 
primary functional benefits of Alternative 2 are:  
• A reduction in the concentration of all organisms leading to lower numbers of these 
organisms being introduced per discharge; and  
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
17 
• The elimination of the exemptions in the BWM regulations leading to the discharge 
of unmanaged ballast water (e.g., safety concerns during exchange, deviation/delay of 
voyage required to travel to acceptable mid-ocean exchange location).  
 
This overall strategy should reduce the number of new invasions because the likelihood of 
establishment decreases with reduced numbers of organisms introduced per discharge or 
inoculation.  
 
We calculate potential benefits of the BWDS by estimating the number of invasions reduced 
and the range of economic damage avoided.  We use information on the invasion rate of 
invertebrates from shipping reported by Ruiz et al. (2000) to project the number of future 
shipping invasions per year.  We then estimate the number of fish and aquatic plant invasions 
based on historical relationships of fish and plant invasions to invertebrate invasions.  We 
then adjust the projected invasions to account for the fraction of invasions that are 
attributable to ballast water and the fraction of invasions that cause severe economic damage. 
The resulting projection of the number of ballast water invasions that will cause harm is 
displayed in Table ES-5.

To estimate the potential economic harm that may be caused by these invasions, we assign a 
cost per invasion based on the limited available data on the range of costs and damages 
incurred by past invasions.  As no comprehensive estimate is available on the costs from past 
invasions, we do not try to develop a composite cost estimate for all invasions, but instead 
select a low and high estimate for fish, aquatic plants, and invertebrates based on 
representative species.  We then calculate a mid-point for the range and calculate costs for 
future invasions using all three values.  The resulting ranges of costs per invasions are 
summarized in Table ES-6.

We assume that once an invasion is established, it will continue to generate costs and/or 
damages for each year subsequent to the invasion.  Thus, an invasion that occurs in the first 
year of our analysis (2012) will incur costs/damages in each of the next 10 years (through 
2021). 
 
Based on the cumulative impacts of invasions, we have calculated a mid-range estimate of 
annual costs for all harmful ballast water-introduced invasions over the 10 year period of 
2012 to 2021 at $2.016 billion at a 7 percent discount (Table ES-7).  These estimates assume 
no ballast water management.

The Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (USCG 2008) has estimated the 
reduction in the mean rate of successful introductions of various alternative standards. In 
comparison with the existing practice of ballast water exchange, Alternative 2 is between 37 
percent and 63 percent effective in preventing invasions when fully implemented.  We use 
these estimates of the reduction in the rate of invasions to estimate the economic cost/damage 
avoided as a result of a BWDS. 
 
As discussed earlier, the implementation of the Alternative 2 BWDS will be phased-in over 
several years.  During the phase-in period of 2012-2016, there is considerable uncertainty as 
to how effective the measures will be in preventing invasions if only a subset of ships have 
implemented ballast water management.  There is also uncertainty as to the availability and 
effectiveness of ballast water management technologies in the early stages of 
implementation. For these reasons we conservatively assume that no invasions will be

avoided before the end of this period (2012-2016), which may lead to an underestimate of 
potential benefits. 
 
The resulting damages avoided for Alternative 2 range from a minimum of $6 million and 
the maximum is $553 million with a mid-range estimate of $165-$282 million per year at a 7 
percent discount rate2 (Table ES-8).

The annualized cost for U.S. vessels over the 10-year period of 2012-2021 for Alternative 2 
is estimated at $167 million at a 7 percent discount rate.  Thus, quantified benefits are 
roughly equal to estimated costs for the mid-point benefits estimate of Alternative 2 Low 
Effectiveness.  The high range annual cost estimate of $307 million is roughly equal to the 
high range benefits estimate of Alternative 2 Low Effectiveness.

The cumulative economic damages avoided would equal cumulative costs incurred by 2019

2 The large range in the estimates of benefits from preventing invasive species is due the natural variability in 
the amount of damage caused by any individual species (i.e., different species can cause a wide range of 
damages from very little in a small area to large, widespread damages).  In addition, the methods, scope, and 
magnitude used throughout the literature to estimate a dollar value of the damages caused by invasions 
introduces a considerable amount of uncertainty into the estimates.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
 
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), we have prepared an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) that examines the impacts of the proposed rule on 
small entities (5 USC 601 et seq.).  Based on available data, we determined that more than 50 
percent of the businesses affected would be small by the Small Business Administration size 
standards. We found that these businesses operate almost entirely in coastwise trade and were 
not involved primarily with larger scale trans-ocean shipping.  We determined that some 
coastwise businesses would incur an impact of more than 1 percent impact on revenue during 
the installation and phase-in period based.  After installation, however, most small businesses 
would not incur a significant economic impact from the estimated annual recurring operating 
costs.  We have determined that this rule would have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
 
Reporting and Recordkeeping 
 
The proposed rule would not require additional reporting, recordkeeping, and other 
paperwork requirements for affected owners or operators. Vessel’s operators or person-in 
charge will comply with same reporting requirements of 33CFR151.2041.

1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Statement of Need 
 
Vessels that release untreated ballast water increase risks to aquatic life and possibly human 
health and cause other environmental and economic harm without accounting for the 
consequences of these actions on other parties (sometimes referred to as third parties) who do 
not directly participate in the business transactions of the business entities.  These costs are 
not borne by the responsible entities and are therefore external to the business decisions of 
the responsible entity.  The goal of environmental legislation and implementing regulations, 
including the proposed BWDS, is to correct these environmental externalities by requiring 
vessels to treat their ballast water releases in order to reduce the environmental harm that 
results from the introduction of some non-indigenous invasive species. 
 
The invasion of NIS in the US waters is a complex negative externality that requires the 
establishment of a unified ballast water discharge standard. Individual initiatives from some 
States do not fully address the NIS invasion problem since waterways are interlinked making 
the withholding of an invasive species a difficult task. Because States regulations are not 
standardized, the cost and equipment requirements might represent an undo burden on 
vessels traveling from port – to – port.  A Federal regulation that standardizes operational and 
equipment requirements on all vessels, with the capability of operating ballast tanks, is the 
most effect alternative to correct this market failure. In a published statement by the 
American Great Lakes Ports Association, they support the Coast Guards initiative to develop 
a Federal regulation that would standardize the criteria for the management of ballast water 
in U.S. waters3.  In addition, a Federal regulation on ballast water discharge will have the 
added benefit of a regulation that complies with international treaties.  
 
 
1.2 Overview 
 
As discussed above, the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) into the waters of the 
United States via the discharge of vessels’ ballast water continues to pose a serious risk to 
coastal facilities and global biodiversity.  Ruiz et al. (2000a) analyzed the likely sources and 
pathways for North American marine invasions and concluded that most invasive species are 
associated with vessels.  The authors estimated that of all invasive species introduced into 
U.S. waters -60 percent, 48 percent, and 64 percent on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, 
respectively- could be attributed to some aspect of the shipping industry. Vectors associated 
with vessels include hull fouling and ballast water discharge (BWD). 
 
The shipping industry uses ballast to optimize the configuration of the vessel so that it 
operates in a safe and efficient manner.  Vessels use ballast to meet orientation (trim, heel, 
and draft), stability, and strength (bending moments, shear forces, and slamming loads) 
requirements both in port and at sea. Ballast water taken into the vessel via onboard pumps is 
the most common form of ballast. Ballast quantities range from a few hundred cubic meters

23 
(m3) to more than 200,000 m3 for the largest tankers. Analysis of the National Ballast 
Information Clearinghouse (NBIC) database shows that vessels discharge more than 40 
million m3 of ballast water from outside the U.S. into U.S. waters each year. 
 
Current ballast water regulations require vessels that operate outside the U.S. Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) to use one of the following ballast water management (BWM) 
practices:  
(a) Conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) at least 200 nautical miles 
from any shore (some vessels may not be able to conduct BWE depending on 
vessel design, age, load, sea conditions, and safety concerns); 
(b) Retain ballast water onboard; or  
(c) Use a United States Coast Guard (USCG) approved alternative method.  Because 
there are currently no approved alternative methods, BWE and retention of ballast 
water are the only available methods of BWM.   
 
Under the legislative mandate in the non-indigenous Species Act (NISA), the USCG must 
approve any alternative methods of BWM used in lieu of BWE.  16 U.S.C. 
4711(c)(2)(D)(iii).  NISA further stipulates that such alternative methods must be at least as 
effective as BWE in preventing or reducing the introduction of NIS into U.S. waters.  16 
U.S.C. 4711(c)(2)(D)(iii).  Determining whether an alternative method is as effective as 
BWE is not an easy task.  The effectiveness of BWE is highly variable, largely depending on 
the specific vessel and voyage.  These variables make comparing the effectiveness of an 
alternative BWM method to BWE extremely difficult.  In addition, a majority of vessels are 
constrained by design or route from practicing BWE effectively.  Ballast water exchange that 
show a proportional reduction in abundance of organisms, so every vessel then has a 
different allowable concentration of organisms in its discharge, support these results.  Thus, 
vessels with very large starting concentrations of organisms in their ballast tanks might still 
have large concentrations of organisms after BWE.   
 
For these reasons, BWE is not well suited as the basis for a protective programmatic 
regimen, even though it has been a useful “interim” management practice.  We have 
concluded that, as an alternative to using BWE as the benchmark, establishing a standard for 
the concentration of living organisms that can be discharged in ballast water would advance 
the protective intent of NISA and simplify the process for USCG approval of a ballast water 
management system (BWMS).  Additionally, setting a discharge standard would promote the 
development of innovative BWM technologies to be used for enforcement of the BWM 
regulations and assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the BWM program.   
 
This regulatory analysis (RA) and initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) evaluates the 
costs, benefits, and other economic impacts associated with implementing a ballast water 
discharge standard (BWDS). This evaluation includes studies of the feasibility and tradeoffs 
of compliance alternatives for vessel owners and operators to install and maintain certain 
types of technology onboard a variety of vessel types and designs.

1.3 Alternative Ballast Water Discharge Standards  
 
Based on the input provided through the scoping process, as well as the information 
developed through workshops, international discussions, and public comments, the USCG 
designated five alternatives for consideration in this RA. The alternatives include: 
maintaining the current BWE requirement (Alternative 1 – “No Action”); three alternatives 
that would establish different and increasingly stringent levels of maximum concentrations 
for living organisms in discharged ballast water (Alternatives 2, 3, and 4); and a one that 
essentially requires sterilization of ballast water (Alternative 5). Alternative 2 is the BWDS 
proposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Ballast Water Convention4 and 
is considered the preferred alternative in this RA. 
 
The three concentration-based alternatives—Alternatives 2, 3, and 4—are more stringent than 
the no action alternative (Alternative 1), but less stringent than sterilization (Alternative 5). 
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 call for limiting discharge to less than a specific number of living 
organisms of a particular size per unit volume of ballast water and a specified set of indicator 
microbes not to exceed specified concentrations.  
 
These three alternatives would establish maximum acceptable discharge concentrations for 
various types of potential NIS such as macrofauna, including fish and invertebrate 
zooplankton; heterotrophic and autotrophic protists (phytoplankton); and microbes (bacteria 
and viruses).  
 
Alternative 1:  No Action 
 
This alternative would not establish a BWDS. Instead, the mandatory BWM program 
established in accordance with the directives in the NISA would continue for vessels entering 
U.S. waters. Currently, the mandatory BWM program directs vessels to utilize at least one of 
the following BWM practices:  conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange, retain ballast 
water onboard, or use an environmentally sound treatment method approved by the USCG. 
Some vessels cannot conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange due to safety and voyage 
constraints. In addition, the USCG has not yet approved any environmentally sound 
treatment methods. Thus, Alternative 1 means that the primary BWM practice for vessels 
would be to conduct mid-ocean exchange when it is safe to do so and when the voyage 
permits. The USCG would need to develop an approval program for alternative methods in 
lieu of a BWDS. Such a program must verify that the alternative methods are as effective as 
mid-ocean ballast water exchange.  
Alternative 2:  Establish The IMO  Ballast Water Discharge Standards  
 
Alternative 2, would establish a maximum discharge concentrations for living organisms, and 
the BWDS would have to be met before the USCG could approve the BWMS.  Those vessels 
                                                 
4 The IMO is an organization of 160 member countries with observers from governmental, industry, environmental, public 
interest, and labor organizations that is concerned with the safety of shipping and cleaner oceans. To achieve its objectives, 
the IMO has promoted the adoption of some 30 conventions and protocols, and has adopted well over 700 codes and 
recommendations concerning maritime safety, the prevention of pollution, and related measures.

that have approved BWMS onboard would discharge a concentration level of living 
organisms in U.S. waters that meet the standard specified under this alternative. 
 
Under Alternative 2, the allowable concentration of living organisms (per volume) in ships’ 
ballast water (by size class) is:  
• For organisms larger than 50 microns in minimum dimension: discharge less than 10 
living organisms per cubic meter (m3) of ballast water. 
• For organisms equal to or smaller than 50 microns and larger than 10 microns: 
discharge less than 10 living individuals per milliliter (ml) of ballast water. 
• For bacteria and viruses, discharge of indicator microbes such that: 
o Toxigenic Vibrio cholera (Serotypes O1 and O139) occur at a concentration 
less than 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 ml. 
o E. coli occur at a concentration less than 250 cfu per 100 ml. 
o Intestinal Enterococci occur at a concentration less than 100 cfu per 100 ml. 
 
Alternative 3:  Establish Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
Alternative 3 would establish a maximum discharge concentrations for living organisms, and 
the BWDS would have to be met before that the USCG could approve the BWMS.  Those 
vessels that have approved BWMS onboard would discharge a concentration level of living 
organisms in U.S. waters that meet the standard specified under this alternative. 
 
Under Alternative 3, the allowable concentration of living organisms (per volume) in ships’ 
ballast water (by size class) is:  
• For organisms larger than 50 microns in minimum dimension: discharge less than one 
living individual per cubic meter of ballast water. 
• For organisms equal to or smaller than 50 microns and larger than 10 microns: 
discharge less than one living individual per ml of ballast water. 
• For bacteria and viruses, discharge of indicator microbes such that: 
o Toxigenic Vibrio cholera (Serotypes O1 and O139) occur at a concentration 
less than 1 cfu per 100 ml. 
o E. coli occur at a concentration less than 126 cfu per 100 ml. 
o Intestinal Enterococci occur at a concentration less than 33 cfu per 100 ml. 
 
Alternative 4:  Establish Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
Alternative 4 would establish a maximum discharge concentrations for living organisms, and 
the BWDS would have to be met before that the USCG could approve the BWMS.  Those 
vessels that have approved BWMS onboard would discharge a concentration level of living 
organisms in U.S. waters that meet the standard specified under this alternative.

27 
Under Alternative 4, the allowable concentration of living organisms (per volume) in ships’ 
ballast water (by size class) is:  
• For organisms larger than 50 microns in minimum dimension: discharge less than 0.1 
living individuals per cubic meter of ballast water. 
• For organisms equal to or smaller than 50 microns and larger than 10 microns: 
discharge less than 0.1 living individuals per ml of ballast water. 
• For bacteria and viruses, discharge of indicator microbes such that: 
o Toxigenic Vibrio cholera (Serotypes O1 and O139) occur at a concentration 
less than 1 cfu per 100 ml. 
o E. coli occur at a concentration less than 126 cfu per 100 ml. 
o Intestinal Enterococci occur at a concentration less than 33 cfu per 100 ml. 
 
Alternative 5:  Ballast Water Sterilization 
 
This alternative essentially requires sterilization of ballast water. It would require the 
removal or inactivation of all membrane-bound organisms (including bacteria) and most 
viruses. Vessels meeting this standard would have approved BWMS onboard that discharge 
virtually no living organisms in U.S. waters. 
 
1.4 Proposed Implementation Schedule 
 
Table 1.1 shows the proposed implementation schedule for meeting the BWDS.  This 
proposed implementation schedule would provide vessel owners and operators sufficient 
time to install the necessary equipment needed to comply with the discharge standard without 
causing significant disruptions to vessels operations and maritime commerce.

1.5 Overview of Ballast Water Management Regulatory Activities 
 
Federal Regulations 
 
On November 29, 1990, Congress enacted the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention 
and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA) (Pub. L. 101-646), which established the USCG’s 
regulatory jurisdiction over BWM. To fulfill the directives of NANPCA, the USCG 
published a final rule on April 8, 1993, entitled “Ballast Water Management for Vessels 
Entering the Great Lakes” in the Federal Register (FR).  58 FR 18330. This rule established 
mandatory procedures for the Great Lakes as defined in 33 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) part 151, subpart C. 
 
A subsequent final rule entitled “Ballast Water Management for Vessels Entering the Hudson 
River”, published on December 30, 1994, amended 33 CFR part 151 to extend the BWM 
requirements into portions of the Hudson River.  59 FR 67632.  
 
On October 26, 1996, Congress enacted the NISA [Pub. L. 104-332], which reauthorized and 
amended NANPCA.  On May 17, 1999, the USCG published an interim rule in the Federal 
Register on this voluntary program titled “Implementation of the National Invasive Species 
Act of 1996 (NISA)”.  64 FR 26672.  The interim rule added a new Subpart D to 33 CFR part 
151 titled “Ballast Water Management for Control of Nonindigenous Species in Waters of 
the United States”.  We published the final rule in the Federal Register on November 21, 
2001.  66 FR 5838. 
 
Through NISA, Congress also directed the Secretary of the Department in which the USCG 
is operating to submit a report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of the voluntary 
BWM program.  In the June 3, 2002 report to Congress, the Secretary of the Department of 
Vessel’s Ballast Water Capacity 
(cubic meters, m3) Vessel’s Construction Date Vessel’s Compliance Date 
New vessels Less than 5000 On or after January 1, 2012 On Delivery 
Equal or greater

Transportation5 concluded that low participation in the voluntary program resulted in 
insufficient data for an accurate assessment of its effectiveness.  This finding triggered the 
requirement in NISA that the voluntary BWM program become mandatory.  A copy of the 
report to Congress can be found in docket (USCG-2002-13147) at 
http://www.regulations.gov. 
 
On July 28, 2004, we published a final rule in the Federal Register titled, “Mandatory Ballast 
Water Management Program for U.S. Waters”.  69 FR 44952.  This final rule changed the 
national voluntary BWM program to a mandatory one requiring all vessels equipped with 
ballast water tanks and bound for ports or places of the United States to conduct a mid-ocean 
BWE, retain their ballast water onboard, or use an alternative environmentally sound BWM 
method approved by the USCG. 
 
On June 14, 2004, the USCG published a final rule in the Federal Register titled “Penalties 
for Non-submission of Ballast Water Management Reports”. 69 FR 32864.  In this final rule, 
we established penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements located in 33 
CFR part 151 and broadened the applicability of the reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements to a majority of vessels bound for ports or places of the United States.  
 
On August 31, 2005, we published a notice of policy in the Federal Register titled “Ballast 
Water Management for Vessels Entering the Great Lakes that Declare No Ballast Onboard”.  
70 FR 51831.  Through this policy, we established best management practices for vessels 
entering the Great Lakes that have residual ballast water and ballast tank sediment.  
 
State Regulations  
 
Several coastal and Great Lakes states have enacted legislation that may be more stringent 
than current federal regulations. Furthermore, the states are considering future activities that 
go beyond the IMO Convention.  If vessels already meet a more stringent standard required 
by states, then the vessel may reduced the costs of implementing the federal regulations. 
Because no state regulations currently require a BWDS, the effects of state regulations on 
costs are not included in this RA. 
 
California  
 
California law required the State Lands Commission to adopt new regulations governing 
ballast water management practices for vessels of 300 gross tons or more arriving at a 
California port or place from outside of the Pacific Coast Region.  The State Lands 
Commission promulgated regulations requiring vessels to meet a BWDS by January 1, 2009.  
Title 2, Division 3, Chapter 1, Article 4.7, Performance Standards for the Discharge of 
Ballast Water For Vessels Operating in California Waters.  The State Lands Commission 
recommended that the implementation date be delayed to 2010.

Washington 
 
Washington’s ballast water law applies to self-propelled ships in commerce of 300 gross tons 
or more and prohibits discharging ballast water into state waters unless a vessel has 
conducted an exchange of ballast water at least 50 miles offshore,. Some vessels are exempt 
from this requirement because they retain their ballast water or discharge ballast water or 
sediments only at the location where they take on ballast water. On August 14, 2007, 
Washington promulgated emergency rules implementing an interim BWDS for the 
inactivation or removal of 95 percent of zooplankton organisms and 99 percent of 
phytoplankton and bacteria organisms.  
 
Michigan 
 
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality established a Ballast Water Control 
General Permit under the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act in 
January 2007.  The permit is applicable to ocean-going vessels that (1) engage in port 
operations and do not discharge ballast water or (2) discharge ballast water treated with a 
method approved by the MDEQ.   The MDEQ identified four treatment methods it views as 
adequate: (1) hypochlorite; (2) chlorine dioxide; (3) ultraviolet (UV) light radiation; and (4) 
deoxygenation.  To date, only permits have been written for ocean-going vessels that do not 
discharge ballast water in Michigan waters. 
 
International  
 
Introductions of potentially harmful organisms via ballast water are an international problem.  
To address the issue, the IMO adopted voluntary guidelines, “International Guidelines for 
Preventing the Introduction of Unwanted Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens from Ships’ 
Ballast Water and Sediment Discharges” in 1997.  In February 2004, the IMO adopted a 
convention, “International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast 
Water and Sediments” (BWM Convention), which establishes BWM procedures and 
includes an international standard for BWD.  The USCG coordinated this effort with the 
EPA, NOAA, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Maritime Administration 
(MARAD), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Department of State (DOS).  
The BWM Convention opened for ratification in February 2004, and under its terms does not 
enter into force until one year after ratification by 30 countries representing not less than 35 
percent of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant shipping.  As of June 2008, 13 countries 
have signed the BWM Convention. The IMO Convention is available via the Internet at:  
http://www.imo.org/ in the MEPC section.

1.6 Regulatory Analysis 
 
We estimate this proposed rule would be economically significant under Executive Order 
12866.   
 
This regulatory evaluation presents an analysis of costs and benefits from the NPRM. These 
cost estimates would likely differ from future costs due to changes in technology, 
installation, and implementation efficiencies that may take place in industry. We expressed 
costs in constant 2007 dollars. This analysis covers a 10-year period (2012-2021) covering 
the phase-in time for the change from ballast management through exchange to management 
via a performance standard.

2 Population Affected  
 
This chapter presents the description of the population affected by this rulemaking, data 
sources, and the estimation of the fleet growth over the period of this analysis. 
 
As described in the previous chapter, this rule will affect all vessels that operate in the U.S 
waters,6 are bound for ports or places in the U.S., and are equipped with ballast tanks. These 
vessels are required to install and operate a USCG approved BWTS before discharging 
ballast water into U.S. waters. This would include vessels bound for offshore ports or places. 
Additionally, whether the vessel traveled 200 nautical miles offshore is not a factor in 
determining applicability. This means that some vessels that operate exclusively in the 
coastwise trade (within the EEZ), which were previously exempt from having to perform 
BWE, would now be required to meet the BWDS.  
 
In accordance with NISA, certain vessels would be exempt from the requirements to install 
and operate a USCG approved BWMS, such as (NPRM, 2008): 
 
(a) Crude oil tankers engaged in coastwise trade and 
 
 (b) Any vessel of the U.S. Armed Forces as defined in the Federal Water Pollution 
 Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1322(a)) that is subject to the Uniformed National Discharge 
 Standards for Vessels of the Armed Forces (33 U.S.C. 1322(n)). 
 
2.1 Overview of Data and Sources 
 
The primary source of data used in this analysis is the Marine Information for Safety and 
Law Enforcement (MISLE) and Ballast Water Reporting Forms (for 2007) submitted to the 
National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC).  MISLE is the USCG database for 
information on vessels characteristics, arrivals, casualties, and inspections.  This database 
presents data from 2002 to present and utilizes the SQL Sequel Software interface for the 
database searches. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) administers the 
NBIC. We present a description of the used data and their sources below: 
 
Number of U.S. vessels affected by the rule 
 
We estimated the U.S. population based on the number of vessels in the MISLE database for 
the year 2007, which will be affected by this rule. The U.S. population includes only active 
vessels. 
 
                                                 
6 U.S. waters means waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as defined in 33 CFR 2.3, including 
the navigable waters of the United States. For 33 CFR Part 151, subpart C and D, the navigable waters include 
the territorial sea as extended to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation No. 
5928 of December 27, 1988. 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
33 
Annual arrivals 
 
We used this data to determine the vessel’s origin and the distinct routes the vessel typically 
transit. We used the routes to differentiate between coastwise and non-coastwise7 vessels. 
Both MISLE and the NBIC database provide the last port of call (and country). However, the 
last port of call is not necessarily the source of ballast water. Vessels that travel between two 
U.S. ports may discharge ballast that originated outside the EEZ and within 200 miles off 
shore. The NBIC database provides the source for ballast water. Vessels on U.S. voyages that 
obtained ballast prior to their first U.S. arrival were entered into the database and included in 
the estimates of BWM and BWD standards costs. 
 
Average total ballast capacity 
 
We used this data to determine the average volumes (in m3) of ballast water that a vessel 
needs to exchange and the equipment necessary to perform the exchange. We obtained data 
from Ballast Water Reporting Forms submitted in 2007 to the NBIC. We then compared 
these average volumes of ballast water for each vessel type (Appendix A) to the data in the 
BWM RA (USCG, 2004). From these data it was determined that mean ballast water 
capacity ranges from 1,700 m3 (fishing vessels) to approximately 215,000 m3 (large tankers).  
 
Vessel service and capacity or size 
 
We used this data to determine the exchange amount (empty-refill or flow-through) and 
equipment cost to complete the BWE information in Appendix B. The NBIC database 
provides the IMO number (a unique vessel identifier) for each vessel. The IMO number was 
cross-referenced with data from the MISLE (which used the Lloyd’s Register of Shipping 
2002) and database to determine vessel service. We identified distinct types of cargo or 
passenger services that could feasibly conduct ballast exchange. These services were further 
delineated by 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) for containerships or deadweight tons (DWT) 
for all other services, yielding 22 distinct vessel types and sizes of vessels that would be 
subject to this rulemaking. The type of exchange utilized by the various vessel types was 
determined from the NBIC data. Although there are trends associated with vessel type, some 
types and even some specific vessels use both the empty-refill and the flow-through methods. 
 
Vessel ballast pump capacity 
 
We used this data to determine the ballast water system maintenance cost as a function of 
total capital cost for a ballast water system. HEC developed information based on personal 
communications with members of the marine industry (e.g. equipment manufacturers) and 
vessel specifications. Ballast water system’s pump capacities range from 250 m3/hour for 
small containerships to 6,500 m3/hour for large liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers and 
tankers. 
                                                 
7 Vessels are deemed to be “coastwise” when they operate exclusively within the U.S. Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ), which is shipping within 200 miles of U.S. coastal waters. “Non-Coastwise” vessels are those that 
travel outside the EEZ, with normal operations is to and from foreign ports.

 2.2 Description of the Maritime Transportation Industry 
 
A diverse group of businesses comprises the ocean transportation industry.  Containerships, 
general cargo vessels, tankers, and dry-bulk carriers dominate the deep-sea cargo carrying 
fleet. Added to this list are specialized vessels carrying commodities ranging from flammable 
gases to vehicles to passengers. Vessels pump ballast water, distribute it throughout the 
vessel, and discharge it from vessels to achieve acceptable conditions of stability, list, trim, 
and longitudinal strength. Cargo operations may change the required quantity of ballast 
water. 
 
The U.S. shipping industry is a net importer. In 2004, imports totaled more than 957 million 
tons while exports were 350 million tons (MARAD 2005). Over the 5-year period from 2000 
to 2004, import tonnage increased 18 percent while exports remained flat. This means that 
the majority of vessels arriving at U.S. ports arrive laden, and thus do not need to discharge 
large amounts of ballast, crude oil imports for example. Containerships are also much more 
heavily laden inbound to the U.S. than outbound. One exception to this general trend are 
shipments of grain in bulk carriers to Asia. 
 
Ocean shipping operations fall into two broad categories:  tramp shipping and liner service. 
Tramp shipping provides convenient, timely, and economical transportation of a broad 
variety of raw materials and finished goods necessary to a global economy. Tramp vessels 
contract for particular cargoes on routes that vary from voyage to voyage. These vessels 
provide excess capacity along established trade routes and low-cost transportation for 
agricultural goods and many natural (crude oil, timber, ores, mineral products) and 
manufactured (petroleum, cement, steel, fertilizers) raw materials. In this sector, it is 
common for all of the cargo on board to belong to a single owner and to be loaded and off-
loaded at individual ports. Tankers and dry bulk carriers are vessel types that typically 
operate on the spot market.8  In contrast, liner-service vessels operate on set routes and on 
fixed schedules. They commonly carry a variety of cargoes, the majority of which are 
finished goods and cargoes belonging to many different cargo owners. In this sector, timely 
service is critical to a successful operation, and the shipping company typically has a large 
traffic department responsible for generating the cargo business to fill the company vessels. 
General cargo and containerships are typical vessel types in this sector.  
 
Vessels in tramp service, moving shipload lots of cargo from one port to another, travel with 
a minimum of ballast and a maximum of cargo in order to maximize revenue generated by 
the voyage. After off-loading its cargo, the vessel typically takes on ballast and travels to a 
different port to load new cargo bound for yet a different port. Thus, these vessels routinely 
discharge all of their onboard ballast at the port in which they load cargo. Liner-service 
vessels, by contrast, travel between ports with a combination of cargo and ballast, therefore 
pumping small volumes of ballast in response to changes in cargo distribution.  
 
                                                 
8 A spot market is one in which commodities, such as grain, gold, crude oil, or computer chips, are bought and 
sold for cash and delivered immediately.  For example, the ownership of crude oil onboard a tanker may change 
several times during a single voyage.

35 
Prior to BWM requirements, it was unlikely that all ballast water in a particular tank on a 
liner-service vessel would have originated in a single port, let alone all the ballast water 
aboard the vessel. Current operations and requirements make the contents of a particular tank 
much more likely to come from the same source. 
 
2.3 Vessel Types and Ownership 
 
We grouped vessels by service and size using a similar procedure as in the BWM RA (USCG 
2004). Data developed by the USCG provided the baseline for the vessel types.  We 
identified each vessel in Lloyd’s Register of Ships through the seven-digit IMO number and 
recorded the vessel type reported by Lloyd’s Register of Ships for each vessel (Table 2.1). 
We further divided bulk cargo vessels and tank vessels into subcategories by dead weight 
tonnage (DWT) according to commonly used industry size ranges (Hunt and Butman 1994). 
We also placed the largest of these vessels into subgroups according to their ability to 
navigate the Panama and Suez Canals. We grouped container vessels into six subgroups 
based on 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) capacity and their ability to transit the Panama 
Canal.9  
 
                                                 
9 Panama Canal operations are such that vessels longer than 294 meters or wider than 32.2 meters are unable to 
pass through the locks.

As shown in Table 2.2, we grouped vessels by size and service into one of 22 vessel types 
based on data from Lloyd’s Register of Ships and MISLE database. We categorized vessels 
according to these classifications developed in the BWM RA (USCG 2004) to more 
accurately estimate costs based on pump capacities, which vary by vessel type and 
size.10(See Appendix A) 
 
We have not included the following vessels in the affected population that would incur 
additional costs from the proposed BWDS based on consultation with the ballast water 
program personnel and USCG expertise: 
 
Vessels less than or equal to 100 ft.  Vessels in this size range typically operate in 
more sheltered environments and do not load and discharge ballast.  Their stability 
characteristics generally accommodate the amount and type of cargo they carry, precluding 
the need to use ballast water as a stability enhancer. 
 
Some towing vessels (tugs towing behind and general).  These vessels do not carry 
cargo and, thus, do not experience drastic changes in draft that would affect their stability 
characteristics.  Therefore, they do not typically load and discharge ballast water. 
 
River vessels.  Rivers are usually very sheltered environments having limited wind 
and wave spectra.  While current conditions play a very large role in sailing and towing 
characteristics, ballasting is not generally used to improve these.  The operations of the river 
barge trade make installed ballast water systems very rare and loading and discharging 
ballast water through void tank main deck openings, without installed piping and pumps, 
would be a costly and extremely time-consuming evolution. 
 
Crew boats.  These vessels are light and fast and primarily transport personnel in 
support of the offshore energy production industry.  They operate on dedicated routes from a 
home base to an oil field and back.  While they might occasionally carry cargo, it is not their 
main purpose.  Therefore, these vessels do not typically load and discharge ballast water. 
 
Crude Oil Tankers engaged on coastwise trade.  These tankers are exempt from the 
rule according to 33 CFR 151.2010 (a) (1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
10 Two tanker categories are renamed to agree with current industry practice. “Handymax” is changed to 
“Handymax – Aframax,” since this group reflects tankers from Handymax to Panamax to Aframax size, and the 
group previously described as “Panamax” is renamed “Suezmax.”

This rulemaking is consistent with the IMO proposed BWDS under the International 
Convention for the Control and Management of Ship’s Ballast Water and Sediments (also 
known as BWM Convention) of February 2004.   For the purposes of this RA, we consider 
the bottom-line costs of this rulemaking for U.S. vessels11.   
 In order to estimate the cost associated with BWTS on the U.S. fleet, we needed to develop 
the range of technologies that may be available and the unit costs of these technologies. We 
assume that there will be a broad market for the new BWTS that includes both U.S. and 
foreign vessels, thus improving the range of technologies available and the cost efficiencies 
of production.   
 
2.4   Fleet Growth and Makeup 
 
We estimated the U.S. fleet growth rates for the various vessel types using the following data 
sources:  U.S. Department of Transportation (MARAD), Clarkson Research Service and the 
U.S. Coast Guard MISLE System Database.  Additional details of the U.S. and world fleet 
growth and removal rate calculations are presented in Appendix A. 
 
We extracted the number of affected vessels from the MISLE database to provide a baseline 
fleet size for year 2007.  In projecting fleet growth, we assumed that there would be no 
optimization of the fleet for U.S. traffic.  That is, we assumed that all vessels involved in 
international trade will be built to both U.S. and international BWDS requirements.  
 
Table 2.3 shows the assumed growth and removal rates forming the baseline case. We 
estimated the number of new builds each year by adding the number of vessels removed to 
the number of vessels needed to achieve the net growth rate.

3 Ballast Water Treatment Costs 
 
Onboard ballast water treatment systems (BWTS), which attempt to eliminate or greatly 
reduce the transmittance of live NIS, are an emerging technology. We have derived some 
systems from existing shore-side water treatment processes, while others involve innovative 
techniques and technologies. We have analyzed the technology, costs, and effectiveness of a 
variety of systems. Much of the present analysis stems from previous work and information 
in papers submitted to MEPC 53. Many of the manufacturers developing alternative BWMS 
have provided direct feedback on costs, capabilities, and testing for their systems. Based on 
analysis of this information, it appears that the technology should be available for installation 
onboard vessels to meet the proposed Alternative 2 (BWD-2) standard, the proposed IMO 
regulation D-2, by the 2012 initial implementation date. Some of the developing technologies 
may be able to meet stricter standards, such as Alternative 3 (BWD-3), one-tenth of the IMO 
proposed levels of NIS, but this will incur additional capital and operating costs and may 
restrict vessel operations. For some vessel types, services, and operating procedures, the 
possibility also exists for a vessel to avoid discharge of ballast altogether. 
 
In this RA, we describe alternative BWMS as generic treatment processes, avoiding 
discussion of specific manufacturers and systems. This approach accommodates situations in 
which multiple vendors may arise or have arisen for a specific treatment process. The object 
of this analysis was to survey the marketplace and describe systems currently under 
development, including the costs and capabilities of those systems. Many of the individual 
systems are patented or have patents pending. We have evaluated the following six different 
treatment processes in detail:  Chlorine Generate, Chemical Apply, Filter & Radiate, 
Deoxygenate, Ozone Generate, and Heat Treatment. See Table 3.1 for a description of these 
processes, including some of their characteristics and capabilities. We have selected these 
processes because some vendors are actively developing and testing systems that operate 
based on the indicated treatment process.  
 
The sources of information regarding the treatment processes are as follows:  
 
1. MEPC 53/2/14 by the USA, dated 15 April 2005; 
2. MEPC 53/2/16 by Norway, dated 15 April 2005; 
3. MEPC 53/2/6 by Sweden, dated 15 April 2005; 
4. USCG supplied system information; 
5. Herbert Engineering Corporation (HEC) updated the information for the BWMS 
technologies and added additional information including updated assessments of 
capabilities of the system, ability to meet stricter standards, testing carried out and 
planned, cost estimates for installation and operation, and effect on tank corrosion. 
This update included research on current BWMS and manufacturers. Some 
information on current BWMS technology and system capability was more complete 
and of greater use than others; and 
6. Technical information, brochures, technical papers, discussions, and other 
information provided by manufacturers.

Table 3.1 describes the generic BWMS processes analyzed in this RA. For each, we 
determined when treatment is applied in the ballast cycle, the time required for the treatment 
to achieve the desired lethality, and the effect on corrosion in ballast tanks. The effect on 
corrosion is included because it is a significant concern for vessel owners, and this impact on 
a BWMS might influence their choice.

Regarding the non-responsive manufacturers, their systems cover the following treatment 
processes: 
   
Deoxygenate – 1 manufacturer 
Filtration & UV – 1 manufacturer,  
Filtration & Chemical Apply (this is a combination of treatment processes) – 2 
manufacturers,  
Hydrodynamic Shear Force – 1 manufacturer.  
 
We described all of these processes in full or in part by the processes above except 
Hydrodynamic Shear Force. Regarding the combined process of Filtration and Chemical 
Apply, the manufacturer that offers only the Chemical Apply process found that filtration 
does not significantly improve the effectiveness of the system. Furthermore, neither 
manufacturer was far along in testing or development; therefore, the information they could 
have provided may have been of limited value. For meeting stricter standards, combinations 
of processes may be required as noted in the section of the RA. Regarding the Hydrodynamic 
Shear Force process, only one manufacturer is promoting that process. Nevertheless, no full-
scale testing had been carried out, and the data, if provided, may be of limited value. 
Obtaining sufficient data from the non-responsive manufacturers prevented us from fully 
incorporating their treatment options into the analysis.  Despite this, we are confident that the 
data which we did obtain from them is pertinent to this study. Because an adequate level of 
detail was not available for the non-responsive manufacturers, we deemed it inappropriate to 
include them in the analysis. Omitting these systems from the analysis should not affect the 
substance, estimated costs, or conclusions of this RA.

3.1 Descriptions of the BWTS and Assessment of Meeting the IMO 
Standard17 
 
We believe most of the BWTS analyzed to have a 50 percent or greater chance of meeting 
the BWD-2 discharge standard within the next few years.  We used multiples sources to 
determine the probability of an alternative BWTS meeting the BWD-2 proposed discharge 
standard.  All analyzed treatment processes have, at some point, been tested—many on full-
size prototypes on vessels. All of the systems have had biological testing of effectiveness to 
varying degrees, and all of the processes have a proven ability to kill living marine 
organisms. We consider all of these processes to be systems that can be made effective for 
some flow rates and levels of treatment based upon industry information, publicly available 
test results, and Herbert Engineering Corporation (HEC) industry experience with marine 
equipment. Many of the systems need further optimization to determine the size of the 
components, the power requirements (such as for UV), or the lethal dosage and the flow rate 
that can be sustained for a given equipment size.  
 
Killing small aquatic life with chemical biocides based on chlorine or bromine is a proven 
technology used extensively in shore-side water treatment. We can adjust the degree of 
lethality by changing the dosage rate. However, the main concern with these systems is 
making the water suitable for discharge in order to minimize harm to the receiving waters. 
This can be accomplished by retaining the ballast onboard for a few days and allowing the 
treatment chemical to degrade (Chemical Apply Treatment, as claimed by manufacturer) or 
by adding a neutralizing substance (Chlorine Generate). These systems reach effectiveness in 
hours. The processes that kill the organisms consume the chemical biocide. The dosage rate 
is set at a level that will leave a small residual in the tank, which can be effective in killing 
any remaining organisms. Further dosing can be accomplished if the residual is consumed. 
Setting the correct dosage rate is an important consideration in the effectiveness of these 
types of systems. 
 
Treatment processes that deoxygenate the ballast water have a similar level of effectiveness. 
We base this rating on recent published reports on the effectiveness of testing a full-size unit 
                                                 
17 New information about additional Ballast Water Treatment Systems was available after the completion of this 
RA. We have not incorporated these new findings in our analysis due to the complexities of the calculations 
used in estimating costs per treatment type, which would require an extensive re-estimation of all costs 
associated with this RA. The new treatment systems available are Hydroyclone – Electrochlorination and 
Menadione or Vitamin K. 
 
The Hydroyclone – Electrochlorination system utilizes two methods to optimize the reduction of living 
organism in ballast water. The system’s initial operation (Hydoyclone) is intended to filter the in-coming ballast 
water by forcing the water into a high velocity rotational centrifugal motion resulting in the separation between 
particles (organisms) and water. Then the Electrochlorination process is introduced to either the particles and or 
the water to maximize the neutralization of any living organisms.  
 
Menadione or Vitamin K (proprietary name Seakleen), is a natural product that is used as a disinfectant for the 
neutralization of living organisms in ballast water. Method of use is as a chemical compound (powder or liquid) 
that is poured into the ballast tank.

on a bulk carrier.18  The deoxygenation process occurs either at uptake by mixing inert gas 
with the water by an eductor or by bubbling the gas into the ballast tanks by a dispersed array 
of bubbler pipes. The hypoxic inert gas will drive the oxygen out of the water. The presence 
of carbon dioxide in the inert gas stream will also significantly lower the pH of the water. 
The combination of low oxygen levels and low pH is toxic to most marine organisms. 
However, the process takes several days to complete and the ballast water needs an inert 
atmosphere for the entire period. Thus, the ballast tanks need to connect to a central inert gas 
system with a closed venting system similar to cargo tanks on tankers. This requires 
modification of the tanks in addition to the installation of a system to apply the inert gas to 
the ballast water. According to the research findings, when the ballast water is discharged, 
the hypoxic and low pH ballast water quickly returns to normal levels upon mixing with the 
receiving waters. According to research, the time required to achieve the desired kill rates is 
about 3 to 6 days, which may pose a problem for vessels on short routes. Additionally, some 
organisms, such as spores, are more resistant to this treatment method, particularly if the 
oxygen levels and pH levels are not as low as intended.  
 
Treatment processes based upon Filtration and Radiation are considered capable of meeting 
the BWD-2 standard, but testing done to date shows it may not be as effective as some of the 
other processes.  
 
For many of these systems, the filtration design can remove organisms above 50 microns in 
size, and filtration takes place at uptake with the filtrate returned to the source waters. One 
vendor proposes a portable system for ballast discharge. For this design, the filtrate needs to 
be disposed of ashore or retained onboard for disposal in the deep ocean. Some of the 
problems linked to filtration systems are that excessive sediment can overload them and 
some organisms can slip through filters because of their shape. Smaller organisms require a 
secondary treatment, such as ultra violet (UV) radiation or processes that use photocatalytic 
effects to create hydroxyl radicals. Both UV and hydroxyl radicals damage cells so that life is 
no longer sustainable. These technologies are well established; for example, UV is widely 
used in water purification. However, UV and other electromagnetic radiation-based 
treatments are sensitive to the transmittance capacity of the water and can be less effective in 
cloudy water and when insufficient wattage is applied. These systems require no residence 
time in the tank for the treatment to be effective.  
 
A fifth treatment process is the generation of ozone onboard. The systems proposed for this 
treatment are less well established compared to the other treatment processes considered. 
Application of the correct dosage depends on the condition of the incoming water and, 
therefore, these systems require complex controls and an ozone generator. Additionally, 
because ozone is a hazardous gas, the process becomes more complicated. Residuals, such as 
bromine-based compounds, may persist in the discharged water. Ballast residence time is not 
a concern with these types of systems because some of the procedures work at discharge only 
and others require only hours of residence time in the tank. 
 
                                                 
18 These systems require an inert gas generator and may require installation of a closed vent piping system for 
the ballast tanks, plus additional piping if the gas is distributed by a bubbler system.

While the use of heat as a means to sterilize water is well documented and utilized 
extensively onshore, there is uncertainty about whether sufficient heat is available onboard to 
meet the required temperature and maintain it for the requisite period of time. These 
uncertainties include:   
 
(1)  The degree to which additional heat generators are needed to achieve the required 
heat;  
(2)  Whether sufficient residence time is available at the required temperature;  
(3)  The very large differences in allowable ballast flow rate depending on the 
temperature of the incoming water;  
(4)  The significant impact of ambient conditions; and  
(5)  Whether heat is only available at sea when the main engine is under full power.  
 
The Heat Treatment system may require operation while underway if there is insufficient 
heat available in port19 to achieve the required temperatures to kill the necessary number of 
organisms during ballast water loading. This system may not be practical except in 
circumstances in which recirculation of ballast water between the heating elements and the 
individual tanks is feasible and desirable. We did not consider Heat Treatment in the 
analyses of costs and performance described below because of the uncertainties identified 
above. Of particular concern is the large range in capital and operating costs, depending on 
the heat sources onboard the vessel and whether additional heat sources are necessary to 
achieve a fully functional heat treatment system on a variety of vessels. This process did not 
appear to offer lower costs or more effectiveness than competing treatment processes; 
therefore, we will not discuss this option further. 
 
We evaluated the following treatment processes and found that they have well-defined 
systems under development with the potential to meet the BWD-2 standard:  Chlorine 
Generate, Chemical Apply, Filter & Radiate, Deoxygenate and Ozone Generation. These 
processes are included in the analysis of their suitability for the various categories of vessels 
and the costs to acquire, install, and operate them. We also evaluated the potential for the 
various treatment processes to meet stricter standards than BWD-2 and their impact on costs 
for meeting such standards.

license fees, regulatory approvals, cost to purchase equipment, and costs for developing a 
specification suitable for installation of the unit on the desired vessel. We also included in the 
cost estimate the necessary changes to existing piping, equipment, arrangement, and 
structure. For new vessel construction, the information would be provided to the shipyard 
design staff so that they could properly incorporate the alternative BWTS into the ballast 
system and machinery space. Installation costs include transporting the system to the 
installation location, providing service technicians, surveying by regulatory agencies, 
carrying out required modifications to the vessel, installing the system onboard, and testing. 
Some of the less intrusive systems can be installed with the vessel in service, but many 
systems require the vessel to be out of service for several days to make the necessary 
modifications. The Chlorine Generate, Chemical Apply, Ozone Generate at discharge (if 
container mounted) and Filter and Radiate are easy to install on smaller vessels. The 
Deoxygenate systems would require a modification to the ballast tank venting system and the 
vessel to be out of service for several days or weeks. None of the proposed systems requires 
the vessel to be drydocked. 
 
Costs associated with out-of-service time are not included in the installation cost estimates 
because we assumed the work would be completed either with the vessel on its normal 
schedule or during a regularly scheduled maintenance and repair out-of-service period. 
Installation costs would vary depending on the geographic location of the modification.  
 
In general, the cost of incorporating an alternative BWTS into a new vessel would be lower 
than an existing vessel because the required space and interface connections for the ballast 
and electric power systems can be designed in the most efficient manner without having to 
modify the vessel. However, the new construction designs and building cycle takes several 
years. Problems may arise if industry is not provided adequate implementation time to 
incorporate the systems into the initial design of some new vessels; therefore, a retrofit would 
be the only living option. 
 
Because this type of specialized equipment cannot be independently priced, the cost analysis 
relies largely on manufacturer provided data. Manufacturers, evaluated for reasonableness, 
supplied costs for equipment and installation, and adjustments made where appropriate. We 
estimated installation costs if unavailable from the manufacturers. Table 3.3 shows the costs 
to acquire and install systems in the U.S. (high) and China (low) based on four nominal 
capacities of systems.

manufacturers for that process were part of this analysis. We provide a single cost where a single manufacturer 
supplied data for that system. NA means the system is not available in that size.  
 
We applied the above costs to the 22 categories of vessels evaluated in this analysis. Because 
this work occurs at a wide variety of ports, we considered it suitable to use an average 
installed cost (average cost of acquisition and installation). For example, we calculate the 
cost of a 1,300 m3/hr chorine generate system by interpolating the costs of the 750 and 2,000 
m3/hr systems as follows20:   
Average Cost of 750 m3/hr system = 350 + (150+75)/2 = 463 
Average Cost of 2,000 m3/hr system = 500 + (200+100)/2 = 650

Total Cost of 1,300 m3/hr system = 463 + (1300-750) x 0.15 = 545 
Tables 3.4 provides the average ballast pumping capacities for each category of vessel and 
state the costs for the systems of the indicated capacities (using the data in Table 3.3) for the 
U.S fleet. Installed costs vary, depending on the technology utilized and the cost of the 
equipment to implement that process. However, variations in cost are also related to a 
process’s development stage.   
                                                 
20 This sample calculation is meant to estimate the combined costs for installations in both U.S. and foreign 
vessels.  To reflect the costs to the US fleet only, we adjust the equations by removing the lowest installation 
cost if there is a range of costs dependent on where the system is installed as provided in Table 3.3.  The 
rationale for the adjustment of the equation above is the assumption that higher costs are incurred in the US 
while the lower costs will be realized overseas.

 3.4 Operation Costs 
 
The operational costs of a BWMS have several components. They are as follows:  
 
1. Energy, usually electrical, to power the system.   
2. Consumables utilized in operating the system. For some treatments, chemicals are 
consumed in the process. Others utilize lamps or filters that must be replaced 
periodically. The manufacturers for each process identified these.  
3. Crew labor to operate the system. 
4. Periodic maintenance and servicing of the system. 
5. Replacing components as they wear out or become defective.  
6. Other logistics, including training and technical information.  
 
The manufacturers supplied us with estimates for the energy needs. Based on these estimates, 
we developed a nominal cost per cubic meter of pumped ballast. Manufacturers also advised 
us on the normal consumables expended in the operation of the system. For example, using 
this information, we estimated the costs associated with chemical biocides on a cubic meter 
processed basis. Some consumables (such as UV lamps) are required after a certain quantity 
of hours of operation. We converted these costs into per cubic meter costs utilizing the 
pumping rate of the system. The cost of required crew labor was not a significant cost to 
manufacturers because most systems featured automatic controls in varying forms. We added 
all the direct operational costs together into an order of magnitude cost per cubic meter 
treated. We evaluated the costs for four nominal system sizes. Table 3.5 includes the 
estimated direct operational costs per cubic meter treated, covering costs for energy, 
consumables, and labor.  
 
Although not a direct cost of operation, the costs for service technicians, maintenance, repair, 
and replacement of components can be the largest cost component of a BWTS. The BWTS 
generally contain many expensive components, as evidenced by the high acquisition costs, 
and many of these components require servicing and periodic maintenance. Additionally, 
many components will require replacement over a vessel’s lifetime. As an estimating guide 
based on HEC input, we assumed that half the initial cost of a system was associated with 
mechanical and electrical components that need maintenance, repair, and replacement over 
time. The other half focuses on design fees, license fees, structural elements, etc. Based upon 
marine industry maintenance and repair experience, we have taken the annualized 
maintenance and replacement costs at 10 percent of the purchase cost for machinery per year.  
 
To determine the maintenance costs per year for each treatment systems, HEC averaged the 
different vessel category’s acquisition costs in Tables 3.4, divided it by two to account for 
machinery and electrical equipment costs, and multiplied that figure by 10 percent to yield a 
net annualized maintenance cost of 5 percent of the initial cost per year. We then divided the 
estimated annual costs for the four nominal system sizes by the estimated annual ballast flow 
for each system equal to about 100 times the system flow rate to get the estimated annual

53 
maintenance cost per cubic meter of treated ballast.23 As can be seen, the maintenance and 
replacement costs are larger than the direct operating costs. As expected from economies of 
scale, the maintenance and replacement costs per cubic meter treated get smaller as the 
system size increases because large systems cost less to buy and maintain per cubic meter 
treated.

3.5 Meeting Stricter Standards 
 
We are evaluating stricter standards that reduce permitted discharge levels of NIS to one-
tenth or even one-hundredth of what is permitted by BWD-2. These are termed BWD-3 (one-
tenth of IMO) and BWD-4 (one-hundredth of IMO). Possible means for achieving an 
effectively zero discharge standard are discussed separately.  
 
In our assessment, if a possible system meets the BWD-2 standard, then it may be modified 
to meet a stricter standard such as BWD-3. However, verifying whether a system meets 
BWD-4 limits is problematic because BWD-4 institutes a high kill rate.  Current testing 
methodology is not capable of ascertaining whether BWD-4 goals are achievable. 
Furthermore, testing such strict standards onboard a vessel will be even more difficult.  
Considering the vast diversity of organisms in the sea with multiple orders of magnitude 
difference in size, the problem of how to measure the achieved discharge rates of NIS as 
analyzed in the various alternative standards is a serious concern of all involved parties. The 
                                                 
24 We assumed operational costs are the same for the U.S. and the foreign fleets.

IMO is evaluating draft guidelines for testing and approval that may be applicable to future 
regulations. In BWD-2, only 10 organisms per cubic meter, 50 micron, in size or larger, can 
be discharged. If a single test proves insufficient, onboard personnel must test several 
additional cubic meters of water to confirm that the shipboard system meets the standard. 
However, if a standard of one-tenth of the BWD-2 limits were implemented (BWD-3), 
testing of several tens of cubic meters or more is needed in order to ensure the validity of the 
data. For the BWD-4 standard that permits only 1 live organism per 10 cubic meters, the 
quantity of water for testing reaches into the hundreds of cubic meters. Therefore, finding the 
few living organisms that may have survived is a difficult and impractical task utilizing 
existing technology. Most manufacturers agreed this was of concern when we discussed the 
possibility of their system undergoing improvements to meet a stricter standard. They 
claimed it would be possible to improve their system to meet a stricter standard, but that 
there was no practical way of demonstrating it. 
 
A standard can only be effective if there is a practical and repeatable means for testing and 
confirming the standard’s goal. If a system meets a standard in the laboratory or in a type 
approval test in a shop, this does not necessarily prove that the system will operate at this 
level under real world circumstances. We based this conclusion on the difficulties 
encountered when testing BWTS in full-scale on vessels. The latest guideline (G8) from 
IMO, per MEPC 53, requires full-scale shipboard testing as part of the type approval process. 
For individual vessel installations, only functional testing would be required.  
 
Several approaches to meeting a stricter standard, such as BWD-3, appear promising. One 
involves making the system more lethal by increasing dosage rates, increasing UV radiation 
power, and increasing residence time in tanks. Another approach requires processing the 
water twice, by either installing equipment in series or treating the water a second time 
(“second pass”) after it has been placed in the ballast tank and before discharge. A third 
approach combines treatment and exchange.  
 
In consultation with the vendors, we conducted an initial investigation of each of the 
treatment processes subjected to analysis in this RA to determine how to meet a stricter 
standard, such as BWD-3 (1/10 IMO). Table 3.7 presents the results of this investigation.

Table 3.7 Cost Impacts of Achieving a Stricter BWD-3 Discharge Standard 
Source: Herbert Engineering Corporation.  Note:  The indicated percentages for the Effects on Capital and 
Operating Costs are the increased costs to meet BWD-3 compared to meeting BWD-2. 
 
For several of the processes, the operating costs increased by a factor of 2.5 (250 percent) 
because it is anticipated that some delays will occur due to the fact that more intense 
treatment slows the ballast pumping rates. This cost factor includes costs associated with 
possible delays. Because manufacturers have not developed designs for meeting stricter 
standards, these cost increases provide a rough order of magnitude. For purposes of 
estimating the order of magnitude on a fleet-wide basis, we propose using a capital cost 
factor of 175 percent and an operating cost factor of 200 percent for comparing the costs of 
systems designed to meet BWD-3 with the cost of systems designed to meet BWD-2. 
 
Utilizing Table 3.7, it appears that the chemical biocide systems is promising because the 
higher kill rates may be achieved by a single processing of the ballast water, albeit with a 
higher dosage rate. This approach has the smallest increase on capital costs. The Chemical 
Apply system has double the operating cost because it utilizes more chemicals to increase the 
dosage rate. In the Chlorine Generate system, some operating costs are not directly related to 
the dosage rate, so the operating cost will not increase as much.  
 
A vessel may achieve a more effective rate of filtration by filtering the water twice.  During 
the first filtration, there may be some clogging or poor sealing of the filter, or some 
organisms may slip through; but they would likely be captured in the second round when the 
water would be cleaner. Similarly, for the UV or other secondary treatment applied after the 
filtration, a second treatment would significantly increase the kill rate because the water

should be clearer and have fewer living organisms. Double processing may require installing 
duplicate systems, which may increase the capital cost by 175 percent (not all costs would be 
duplicated, just some of the equipment costs). 
 
The effectiveness of the Deoxygenate systems cannot be improved by a more intense 
treatment because once the oxygen is taken out and the pH lowered, the system is at its 
maximum efficiency. To meet a stricter standard, more powerful equipment may be provided 
to ensure that the most complete processing is employed; that is, to ensure that the required 
levels of deoxygenation and pH are achieved every time and fully maintained over the 
required period of time. This is the logic behind assigning a factor of 125 percent to this 
system. The effectiveness of this system can be improved by retaining the water in the 
deoxygenated environment for a longer period of time. For vessels on shorter voyages, this 
will create additional costs if a vessel has to wait or hold unwanted ballast because it cannot 
meet the required residence time, approximately 6 to 10 days.  
 
Chemical biocides may be the most efficient means of achieving higher kill rates.  Several 
manufacturers mentioned that the effectiveness of some of the other systems may improve by 
adding a chemical biocide treatment. For example, if manufacturers added this treatment to a 
filtration and UV system, the expected impact on cost would be similar to that given above. 
Such an approach would eliminate the need to double-process the water and would simplify 
the handling of ballast for the vessel operator. This change, however, makes the installed 
system more complex and may create concerns about handling chemicals and possibly 
neutralizing them before discharge. Based on testing done by several manufacturers for 
chemical biocide systems, there appears to be no benefit in combining biocides with filtering 
because the biocide can kill all organisms.  
 
For some of the processes, longer exposure to treatment and additional processing will 
improve the kill rate and may achieve a higher level of sterilization. However, lowering the 
flow rate will increase the time for ballasting and may cause the vessel to remain in port 
longer, thus delaying vessel operations. 
 
Conducting further research would provide a clearer picture of the benefits of combining 
treatment and exchange. However, conceptually it appears to achieve a reduced level of 
organisms in the treated water. This technique would work as follows:  any ballast water 
taken on in coastal or port waters would be treated so that the water in the ballast tanks had 
reduced organisms compared to untreated water. The treated coastal ballast water would be 
replaced via BWE during the voyage, either by the ER or FT method, with mid-ocean water. 
It is possible that water taken on in mid ocean would have far fewer organisms than coastal 
or port waters. Treating the mid-ocean water upon intake could further improve overall 
effectiveness. This dual process approach has the potential of meeting a stricter standard with 
existing technology designed for the BWD-2 standard. There would be no impact on capital 
cost, but operating cost would roughly double because the contents of a ballast tank require 
treatment at least twice because of exchange. However, this approach would, not alleviate 
safety concerns associated with BWE.

Evaluating technologies capable of meeting Alternative 4 (BWD-4) standards remains an 
uncertain endeavor. In general, the approaches and issues applicable to BWD-3 apply to 
BWD-4.  
 
Direct costs of the chemicals in chemical biocide systems are a function of dosage rate. 
Equipment costs are a function of system capacity, which in turn depends on maximum 
anticipated dosage rate. For higher dosage rates, equipment size increases, including larger 
storage tanks, dosage pumps, and pipes. Increases in equipment size and costs are not linear 
increases in flow rate because of some economies of scale. Other technologies might require 
repeated processing or series application of the method, all of which would increase costs. 
Longer retention times introduce the risk of voyage delays that can incur additional costs of 
tens of thousands of dollars per day based upon lost opportunity or demurrage fees. 
 
Approaches that occur at uptake, such as filtration or hydroclonic separation, may be 
appropriate for some NIS size ranges. These approaches would also be appropriate as a 
method to achieve near-zero discharge of NIS (Alternative 5). Filtration could be an effective 
approach (CSLC 2005), but recent trials (Wright and Mackey 2006) indicate that filtration is 
not necessarily completely effective. Early testing of hydroclonic separation, which 
eliminates particles (sediment or biota), shows some promise. 
 
Eliminating BWD achieves maximum reduction in introduction of NIS. Effectively zero 
discharge (Alternative 5) might be achieved by a combination of operational practices that 
virtually eliminate discharge and the use of treatment systems capable of BWD-4 or similar 
standards to be used in the case of emergency. These emergency uses could be regulated and 
would not require high capacity systems. For a further discussion of effectively zero 
discharge, see Section 3.6. 
 
3.6 Discussion 
 
Cost Uncertainty 
 
Several issues regarding the certainty of the estimations made for this RA merit discussion. 
Although significant progress has been made in the development of the treatment systems 
able to meet the BWDS, these technologies are in continual development and refinement. 
Systems should start to be commercially available by the end of 2009 (Lloyds, 2008).  
Therefore, we base all costs on manufacturer estimates for the prices they hope to receive for 
their equipment. The rigors of the competitive marketplace have not honed prices. 
Additionally, the ease of installation onboard vessels depends on the vessel arrangement and 
its piping and machinery systems. Vessels within the same basic category can have 
significant differences that would affect the ease of installation. The costs for individual ships 
could vary widely from what is estimated for that category of vessel. Therefore, it is possible 
that estimated installation costs could vary with location or due to competition in the market 
place. Similar variance is possible for operating costs.

Approval Technology Testing  
 
The technologies discussed in this RA will be subjected to the USCG BWTS approval 
process before being available in the marketplace.  The USCG is establishing an approval 
program, including requirements for designing, installing, operating, and testing BWMS to 
ensure these systems meet required safety and performance standards. Currently, 
manufacturers are submitting BWMS designed to meet the BWDS.  All indications are that 
there will soon be technologies available on the market to allow vessels to meet this standard 
(see NPRM for detailed information on BWDS receiving approval).  Nevertheless, testing is 
still an ongoing process as technologies are adapted to the different vessel design, operations 
and environmental conditions.  
 
Time Frame for Implementation 
 
Another area of uncertainty is the possibility that there may be a shortage of equipment to 
implement BWTS on a large scale around the world in a short time frame. Because this is a 
new product, the specific components needed for this equipment are most likely not being 
manufactured today on the scale needed. Certainty about the requirements, testing, and 
approvals is needed before companies will invest in the facilities for large-scale production. 
There may be a time lag of several years from the time there is significant certainty to justify 
investment until equipment is produced and delivered on a wide scale. Additionally, the time 
lag between technical development of the regulatory requirements and enforcement of the 
regulation should be taken into consideration. Once the regulatory regime is articulated and 
actual production and installation have begun, we consider it relatively easy to install a 
treatment system. The equipment for installation is often similar to commercially available 
equipment and production can be increased to meet demand. However, any specialized 
components may not be immediately available. The normal vessel repair industry can do the 
installation if it does not require special training or tools.  
 
Safety Issues 
 
The purpose of BWTS is to kill living organisms. The processes utilize chemicals, radiation, 
and equipment that create conditions that may be hazardous to human health. There is an 
existing regulatory environment onboard vessels and in industry regarding safety precautions 
and handling techniques for hazardous chemicals. We assume that any necessary 
modifications or special handling procedures will be resolved by individual vessels during 
the choice and installation of equipment.  Manufacturers who use chemicals in the system 
have proposed transporting and restocking chemicals onboard using only their trained service 
agents, not the vessel’s crew. Manufacturers would also like to set up procedures for disposal 
of unused chemicals in the event that the system on a vessel needs to be disabled or 
dismantled. Most of the BWTS are sealed processes, in which case the vessel’s crew would 
not handle or apply the chemicals by hand. Sealed pipes transfer chemicals from the storage 
tanks to the processing equipment. To prevent discharge of large amounts of hazardous 
chemicals during a vessel casualty, requirements are needed to ensure that the quantities 
onboard should be limited and that they should be stored in sturdy containers in a protected 
location.

Systems that employ radiation, such as UV-based systems, require safeguards in place to 
ensure against human exposure to the UV and that users are aware of any special precautions 
needed for disposing of the UV lamps.  Vessel operators should already be aware of these 
precautions as UV equipment is currently used onboard vessels for potable water 
sterilization.  Chlorine generation systems have already been used onboard vessels on a small 
scale for eliminating fouling in vessel seawater cooling systems. With regard to the 
Deoxygenate process, in which the ballast tanks need to be inerted, tanks must be well-vented 
prior to personnel entering them. Tankers currently have experience with inerted cargo tanks, 
but most dry cargo vessel crews have no such experience. If there are cracks in the ballast 
tank bulkhead, inert gas may flow into adjacent spaces, including cargo holds or void spaces, 
posing a hazard to anyone entering those spaces. Good tank entry practice is to test the 
atmosphere in any enclosed space, such as a tank, for oxygen prior to entry. These 
procedures need to be rigorously applied onboard a vessel that employs a process utilizing 
inert gas. Overall, we believe the safety issues with regard to the operation of BWTS onboard 
vessels can be managed. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
 
BWTS that employ chemicals or generate chemicals onboard need to be designed in a 
manner that ensures that no active biocides are discharged overboard. For many of the 
systems, the biocide has a short life and would degrade by the time the vessels discharges 
ballast. Other manufacturers have determined that the discharged ballast water would have 
residual biocide and they have incorporated features into their systems to neutralize the 
residual chemicals. This typically involves adding a neutralizing agent, which makes it safe 
to discharge ballast overboard. Manufacturers that employ the Deoxygenate process have 
tested the effect of the hypoxic and low pH water on the receiving waters and have 
determined that it dissipates within a few meters of discharge. There are pending guidelines 
from IMO about the testing requirements for systems that employ active substances, and 
these requirements cover verification of the effects on the environment of discharging ballast 
water treated in the proposed manner.  
 
Effect on Corrosion in Tanks 
 
The proposed BWTS processes have varying effects on the corrosion of steel in ballast tanks. 
Several systems have no effect, such as the ones that filter and irradiate the water. The 
systems that deoxygenate the water actually reduce corrosion in tanks because there is less 
oxidation of the steel at reduced oxygen levels (Tamburri and Ruiz, 2005). Furthermore, 
manufacturers indicate that because these processes do not fully remove all oxygen, 
anaerobic conditions do not exist in the tanks; therefore, growth of anaerobic bacteria would 
not be promoted. Possible establishment of anaerobic conditions would be of concern 
because anaerobic bacteria are able to accelerate corrosion.  
 
BWTS that apply chemicals such as chlorines and ozone generally create oxidants that can 
promote corrosion. If a tank is well-coated with a hard epoxy, there should be limited 
deleterious effects at the concentrations of chemicals required for ballast treatment. However, 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
61 
if tank coatings have deteriorated, then we expect accelerated corrosion. In addition, if we 
increase dosage rates to meet stricter standards, corrosion will increase. The heat treatment 
process also promotes corrosion in ballast tanks. This is an effect well known to the marine 
industry because ballast tanks adjacent to heated oil tanks suffer from accelerated coating 
breakdown and steel corrosion. Quality of coatings is an important consideration in adopting 
this system.  
 
It is difficult to quantify the impact of these processes on corrosion before implementation of 
the systems or collection of actual corrosion data. We do not anticipate that corrosion will be 
a significant cost driver except, perhaps, in the case of the heat treatment system, and, 
therefore, the effect of corrosion is not included in the cost analysis. 
 
 
Zero Discharge as a Means of Meeting Alternative 5 Ballast Water Discharge Standard 
 
The most effective way to stop the spread of NIS through BWD, and thus meet the 
Alternative 5 standard, is by eliminating the discharge of ballast water containing live 
organisms into U.S. waters. This solution is difficult to apply to all vessels because of the 
wide variety of vessels, cargoes, and the need of some vessels to discharge ballast in U.S. 
waters for safety reasons. Nevertheless, the primary strategy for eliminating the discharge of 
live organisms is to discharge no ballast and, if the vessel has to discharge ballast, to take 
measures to ensure sterilization of the ballast. We have outlined some possible approaches in 
the following discussion. 
 
Sterilized Ballast 
 
There are several approaches to sterilizing ballast water for discharge in ports; however, none 
is without significant cost and many require some change in vessel operations or investment 
in facilities and means of transport. Approaches to achieve sterile ballast include:   
 
• Sterilize the water onboard. To accomplish sterilization of ballast water onboard requires 
a highly effective and intrusive BWT system, probably including filtration, high levels of 
biocides, and long retention times. Unlike most facilities that sterilize municipal potable 
water, which start with relatively clean water, these systems must account for the large 
amount of organisms contained in the uptake water, requiring very high kill rates. 
• Use fresh water for ballast:  Clean fresh water taken from shore is one approach to ensure 
sterilization of ballast water. The principal difficulties in using fresh water for vessels that 
normally load and discharge ballast are its cost and availability. 
• Shore-based Treatment:  Seawater ballast could be treated in a shore-based facility rather 
than onboard the vessel. A vessel could take on treated ballast or ballast taken on 
elsewhere could be discharged to a facility for treatment and disposal. Investment in 
widespread facilities for ballast treatment would cost millions of dollars, even at a 
regional level (URS/Dames & Moore 2000), and would most likely be paid for by fees to 
process the ballast. Considering the high cost of implementation, shoreside sterilization 
also appears to be a niche solution.

No Discharge of Ballast 
 
Besides the sterilization of ballast water, the other alternative to obtain zero discharge of live 
organisms is for vessels to avoid discharging ballast in ports or coastal waters. As discussed 
in this RA, many vessels have already adopted this policy for many of their U.S. ports calls, 
particularly the ports with the most stringent regulation of ballast discharge. 
 
One approach is to change vessel designs to make vessels more multi-purpose so they can 
carry a larger variety of cargoes. This would improve the possibility for backhaul cargoes. A 
zero discharge solution would encourage a new round of innovative solutions, but would no 
doubt also significantly increase overall costs. 
 
In evaluating the possibility of eliminating discharge of ballast, we divide vessels into two 
primary groups: 
1.  Vessels that carry ballast and cargo:  Vessels that normally carry a mix of ballast and 
cargo are the ones for which this approach is most practical. These vessels would normally 
not discharge or take on much ballast in any port and might achieve zero discharge. 
 
Vessels that normally carry a mix of cargo and ballast are:  
• Containerships 
• RORO ships 
• General cargo ships 
• Combination ships 
• Passenger ships 
 
2.  Vessels that carry ballast or cargo:  Some vessel types carry full loads of cargo from port 
to port and sail from discharge ports back to the loading port in a ballast condition. These 
vessels generally carry bulk cargoes, either dry or liquid. Such vessels would suffer the most 
from a no discharge of ballast operating mode. The weight of ballast onboard when entering 
the loading port would reduce by the same weight the amount of cargo that can be loaded, 
since these vessels normally take on full loads of cargo. This lost revenue represents the cost 
of implementing a zero-discharge standard.   
 
The vessels that carry either ballast or cargo are:  
• Tankers 
• Bulk carriers 
• LNG ships 
• Chemical carriers 
 
For these vessels, the quantity of ballast onboard for a normal sea passage is roughly 35 
percent of the full load cargo weight. In good weather, it may be possible for these vessels to 
deballast as they approach the loading port to a state where the ballast weighs only 10 to 20 
percent of the full load of cargo weight. In addition, vessels such as oil tankers and LNG 
carriers generally arrive at U.S. ports fully laden with cargo. Such vessels will normally not

discharge ballast, but will take on ballast for the return leg, and thus could meet the zero-
discharge standards for U.S. arrivals.

4 Application of Ballast Water Treatment Cost Models 
 
In this chapter, the system costs developed in the previous chapter is applied to the affected 
population. The analysis covers a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021, when the requirements 
for BWM first stipulate meeting BWD performance. 
 
We have estimated the number of vessels that will have to install or retrofit ballast water 
systems each year for each vessel type based on the proposed phase-in schedule (presented 
on Table 1.1). We apply these data together with the one-time capital and installation costs to 
develop overall implementation costs for U.S. vessels.25 Capital installation costs are based 
on the type of systems presented in Table 3.4. 
 
This rulemaking is consistent with a multi-lateral agreement at the IMO.  For the purposes of 
this RA, we consider the bottom-line costs of this rulemaking to involve U.S. vessels. 
Nevertheless, we anticipate that the development of treatment technology will involve the 
world fleet, not the U.S. fleet alone. 
 
In order to estimate the cost associated with BWTS on the U.S. fleet, we needed to develop 
the range of technologies that may be available and the unit costs of these technologies.  We 
assume that there will be a broad market for the new BWTS that includes both U.S. and 
foreign vessels, thus improving the range of technologies available and the cost efficiencies 
of production.  
 
4.1 Calculation Approach for Costs of Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
In this section, we describe the costs to install and operate BWTS. We have developed low 
and high estimates for installed costs for systems that would be applicable to the various 
vessel types. 
The BWMS industry is in its formative stage, and we expect scale-based efficiencies to 
evolve. As noted in the previous chapter, the costs should decrease over time, but the extent 
is unknown and, therefore, only considered in the uncertainty analysis presented at the end of 
this chapter. 
 
Under the current rulemaking, implementation of BWTS would be required starting in 2012 
for new vessels and phased in over the next 5 years for existing vessels. We use the growth 
assumption (including removal rates) as outlined in Chapter 2 to determine the size of the 
fleet and the number of new vessels each year. Projecting growth trends out 10 years is an 
uncertain process. The entire fleet will be required to meet the discharge standards by 2016. 
In our cost model, for the period beyond 2016, we account only for the new vessels built in 
2016 or later.

Tables 4.1 presents the installation costs for the U.S. fleet. The installation costs were 
calculated based on the average costs for each available ballast water treatment system 
(Table 3.4). The low costs presented on the tables below are related to the cheapest treatment 
available and the high costs are related to the most expensive treatment available.

The capital costs of installing the BWTS are significantly greater than existing BWE costs 
(Appendix B). In practice, many vessels do not discharge in U.S. waters and many could 
adjust their operations to avoid discharge. For example, many container vessels already set 
up their ballast before arriving in the EEZ based upon advance information about the next 
departure load condition. We anticipate that this will become the practice for many of these 
vessels independent of the imposed standard. In theory, these vessels could avoid the capital 
costs entirely. However, vessel owners will not consider the U.S. approach in isolation. For 
example, tankers that discharge no ballast in the U.S. may discharge ballast in other ports and 
so would install a BWTS if required to do so by any of the loading ports along their expected 
trading routes. In general, the likely approach would be to acquire the least expensive and 
easiest system to install and manage the ballast so that all the ballast onboard could be 
discharged at any time if needed. 
 
In year 2014, vessels built before 2012 with ballast capacities between 1,500 and 5,000 cubic 
meters will be required to meet the discharge standards under the rulemaking phase-in 
structure (Table 1.1). While industry practice is to delay additional costs as long as possible, 
a certain proportion of the fleet will undergo these installations during routine shipyard visits 
for other regularly scheduled maintenance. We have assumed that 30 percent will install 
BWTS each year in the first two years (2012 and 2013) and 40 percent in the last year of the 
compliance requirement (2014).  
 
In 2016, the remainder of the fleet built before 2012 and certain new vessels will be required 
to meet the BWDS. In this case, we have assumed that 20 percent of the population will 
install the system each year (from 2012 to 2016).  Given these assumptions and the projected 
fleet growth as defined in Chapter 2 (Table 2.3), the number of vessels undergoing BWTS 
installations is as shown in Table 4.2. In order to account for the impact of these assumptions 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect of compliance percentage per year and 
the total cost of the rulemaking for U.S. vessels (section 6.2).

4.3 Operating Costs of Ballast Water Treatment System 
 
BWTS operational costs are in addition to the capital costs for installation. In order to obtain 
a cost of operation for U.S, we first calculated the amount of ballast discharge per vessel type 
(Table 4.4).

The average amount of ballast water discharged per vessel type is calculated by using data 
collected by NBIC for year 2007. The amounts of discharge from vessels, represented in the 
above table, are of those vessels that reported actual discharge of ballast in year 2007. This 
data was then cross-referenced to population data gathered from USCG MISLE database in 
order to match vessel activity with their corresponding category by vessel type. 
 
Once the ballast water discharge by vessel type was determined, we multiplied these 
estimates by the number of vessels undergoing installation in Table 4.2 Then multiply this 
product by the cost presented in Table 3.6 using the lowest cost per cubic meter of water for

each particular vessel type.  The calculated value is then used to formulate an annual 
operating cost for BWT (Table 4.5) per vessel type. 
 
Table 4.5 displays the operating costs for all affected vessels in the population.  The total 
operating costs covering the period of analysis is $8.1 million with a discounted cost of $6.7 
and $5.3 million at 3 and 7 percent discount rates, respectively.

4.4 Total Costs of Ballast Water Treatment Systems 
 
For the purposes of estimating the total cost of BWTS, we multiply the operating costs by the 
proportion of vessels we have estimated to be treating ballast each year. However, once a 
vessel begins treatment of ballast water, their operational cost continues to be carried-over 
into the following periods. Therefore, total cost of the BWMS during the installation period 
will increase substantially due to the commutative nature of operating BWT. This section 
illustrates the total costs (installation and operational) for U.S. vessels over the period of 
analysis (2012 – 2021).  
 
We estimate the first-year total (initial) cost of this rulemaking to be $239 million based on a 
7 percent discount rate and $248 million based on a 3 percent discount rate (Table 4.6). Over 
the 10-year period of analysis (2012-2021), the total cost of Alternative 2 for the U.S. vessels 
is approximately $1.18 billion using the 7 percent discount rate and $1.35 billion using the 3 
percent discount rate. The annualized cost over the 10-year period is $167.48 million at 7 
percent and $158.12 at 3 percent. At the high end of costs, assuming all vessels install the 
highest cost treatment equipment, the annual costs over the 10-year period are $307 million 
at 7 percent and $290 million at 3 percent. Our cost assessment includes existing and new 
vessels. In Appendix C Table C.7 we show the foreign cost to illustrate the potential impact 
to vessel owners and operators that will be operating in U.S. waters. 
 
In addition, owners and operators performing BWE will no longer be required to perform 
BWE. See Appendix B for more detail on BWE costs. We have not considered the potential 
cost savings due to the termination of the BWE operations in the BWDS total costs 
estimation presented in table 4.6 because BWE costs are extremely small when compared to 
the BWDS estimated costs, representing less than 0.1 percent of the total cost of this 
proposed rule.

4.5 Cost of Ballast Water Management Systems in Terms of Vessel Value 
and Daily Charter Rates 
 
Shipowners face three cost elements:  capital, operating, and voyage. Capital costs are fixed 
costs, whereas operating and voyage costs are variable. Because the fixed costs are always 
present, shipowners will offer their vessels for charter if at least the variable costs are 
covered. These costs represent the lower bound of charter rates. Installation of BWTS for 
new buildings represents part of the capital cost. We can compare the cost impact to the 
vessel value at various ages and their amortized cost to the increase in the charter rate 
necessary to recover this investment. Operational costs associated with BWTS would form 
part of the lower bound charter rate. However, as shown below for bulk carriers, these 
operational costs are small in comparison to charter rates.  
 
Long-term (i.e., 12-month) charter rates reflect supply and demand. Table 4.8. shows a 
twenty-year average (1980-2000) of the daily time charter rates for several vessel types. 
However, current rates are significantly higher for most vessel types.

Bulk carriers represent 14 percent of the overall installation costs for BWD-2. Estimated 
installation costs in 2021 for Handy size bulk carriers range from $419,000 to $842,000 per 
vessel (see Tables 3.4). Estimated values of bulk carriers at the top of the Handy size range 
(~50,000 DWT) vary, depending on trade demands. At the end of 2005, the estimated value 
of this size bulk carrier ranged from $29 million for a new vessel to $10 million for a 20- 
year-old vessel (Compass 2006).

The Baltic Exchange, formerly known as the Baltic Freight Index (BFI), tracks bulk carrier 
potential revenues through the Baltic Dry Index (BDI). From 1996 to 2003, this index varied 
in the range from approximately 1000 to approximately 1500 (Findata 2006). In the next two 
years, this index soared to over 5500 on two occasions, with a minimum below 2000, 
exhibiting a recent trend toward increasing volatility (Findata 2006). At the end of 2005, the 
BDI was about 2400. Recent projections based upon increased demand by China and other 
Asian countries suggest that the BDI, and thus charter rates, will tend to increase over the 
long term (Fearnley 2006).  
 
The assumption that current rates represent an estimate of future returns allows for the 
approximation of an upper bound of the amortized cost of BWT systems relative to potential 
revenues. 
 
At the end of 2005, the average 12-month time charter rate for the top of the Handy size 
range was $17,000 per day (Compass 2006). According to HEC, amortizing the BWMS 
installation costs of $419,000 to $842,000 over an assumed 15-year service life, the 
additional cost of BWT is approximately 0.4 to 0.8 percent of the daily charter rate. Even if 
the charter rates were to temporarily return to the 20-year average of $8,000 per day, the 
amortized cost would rise to only about 1.7 percent of the daily charter rate. HEC has 
estimated operating costs in 2006 to be less than 0.05 percent of the daily charter rate.  
 
For a Capesize bulk carrier, the 10-year-old vessel estimated value is $38 million and the 
current average 12-month time charter is $34,500 per day (Compass 2006). Upper bound 
installation costs are about 3.8 percent of the value of a 10-year-old vessel. Amortizing the 
cost over 15 years indicates a daily cost of approximately 0.8 percent of the daily charter rate. 
 
Tanker long-term charter rates also reflect supply and demand. Over the past four years, 
charter rates for Aframax tankers have steadily increased from $17,000 per day at the end of 
2002 to $37,500 per day at the end of 2005 (Compass 2006). Demand for oil continues to 
increase as population and energy use per capita increase, thus requiring an increase in oil 
shipment. Tanker orders declined in 2005 compared with the previous two years (Marsoft 
2006). The existing fleet of single hull tankers has largely been replaced and new 
construction is tapering off. 
 
Assuming that the average 12-month time charter is $35,000 per day for an Aframax tanker, 
amortizing the installation cost over 15 years indicates a cost of approximately 0.6 percent of 
the daily charter rate. Assuming a 20-year average of $13,000 per day, the cost of the 
BWMS, installation increases to about 1.6 percent of the daily charter rate. Other vessel 
types exhibit comparable trends. 
 
Industry experts were consulted by HEC to assess other factors affecting costs and 
economies of scale are possible for BWTS. The consensus was that prices provided by 
manufacturers represent current costs with current technologies and construction facilities. 
Offshore manufacturing (e.g., in China, Korea) and larger manufacturing facilities will drive 
down future costs.

Charter rates and the overall cost of shipping goods are market driven. The operating costs 
represent the lower bound of charter rates. Ship owners will pull vessels off the market when 
rates fall much below this level. Therefore, in the short term, modest capital costs, such as the 
installation of BWTS will have little or no effect on charter rates. Over the longer run, the 
cost of shipping goods will reflect the costs of BWTS because ship owners must ultimately 
recapture their investment in order to remain commercially viable.

5 Benefits from Reducing Invasions of Non-indigenous Species 
 
Bioinvasions of aquatic ecosystems can result in adverse economic impacts on industries that 
are dependent on those ecosystems.  The purpose of this section is to discuss the costs 
associated with bioinvasions of aquatic ecosystems, and specifically to discuss the overall 
economic harm attributable to bioinvasions resulting from the introduction of NIS through 
ballast water.  Subsequent sections discuss the costs (economic harm) associated with the 
primary economic activities impacted by aquatic bioinvasions: (1) water-dependent 
infrastructure, (2) subsistence, (3) tourism and recreation, (4) water-related subsistence 
activities, (5) commercial fishing, and (6) recreational (sport) fishing.  Quantification of 
some of the economic impacts, as well as a reliable assessment of public health risks (and 
costs) related to bioinvasions of aquatic ecosystems remain problematic. 
 
In the second part of this chapter, we attempt to quantify and monetize avoided costs 
associated with future NIS invasions that represent the benefits of BWM. These avoided 
costs provide the same benefits whether the reduction in invasions is achieved through BWM 
via exchange (USCG 2004) or the use of a BWDS. Economic costs from invasions of NIS 
are in the billions of dollars annually. 
 
5.1 Resources at Risk 
 
Loss of biodiversity 
 
Invasions of U.S. waters by NIS are occurring at increasingly rapid rates (Carlton et al. 1995, 
Ruiz et al. 2000a). The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy notes that invasive species are 
considered one of the greatest threats to coastal environments and can contribute 
substantially to altering the abundance, diversity, and distribution of many native species 
(USCOP 2004). While introduction of a NIS does not necessarily lead to invasion, the 
sudden availability of a new habitat and absence of natural predators can lead to runaway 
growth that pushes out other species. Unlike oil and other forms of pollution, where the 
deleterious effects can degrade over time, invasive species can persist, reproduce, and spread. 
The discharge of ballast water is considered a primary pathway for the introduction of NIS 
(USCOP 2004). The social and economic implications of accelerating the loss of biodiversity 
bear directly on several ecological interrelationships, including the following (NRC, 1995): 
 
• the ocean’s capacity to sustain economically significant fisheries, 
• the quality of bays and estuaries as nurseries for important stocks, 
• the loss of species with significant potential for biomedical products, 
• the recreational value of ocean margins, and 
• the aesthetic value of marine environments that remain close to their 
aboriginal state. 
 
Water-dependent infrastructure  
 
Water-dependent infrastructure includes water intake pipes, storm sewer drains, docks, piers, 
canals, dams, navigation locks, and facilities such as electric power plants, drinking water 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
79 
treatment plants, water storage facilities, and water distribution systems (USCG 2006). 
Water-dependent infrastructure must deal with the impacts of unexpected interruptions 
caused by disruption or contamination (USEPA 2001).  
 
Invasive invertebrates, such as the zebra mussel and the Asian clam, have adversely affected 
water-dependent infrastructure by fouling intake pipes and screens, causing equipment 
malfunction and overheating, and jamming valves and other mechanisms. Affected systems 
include electric power generation stations, drinking water treatment plants, industrial 
facilities, and navigation lock and dam structures. Additionally, invasive aquatic plants have 
caused problems on rivers and canals. Costs associated with the zebra mussel approach $1 
billion annually and were about the same in the 1980s for the Asian clam (Pimentel et al. 
2005). 
 
Subsistence living primarily involving Native American, Alaskan, and Hawaiian tribes 
 
Subsistence living in the U.S. involves Native American, Alaskan, and Hawaiian tribes, as 
well as the inhabitants of the U.S. territories that include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.  The 
Indigenous Environmental Network (see http://www.ienearth.org/) notes that indigenous 
peoples depend on the fish, aquatic plants, and wildlife to a greater extent and in different 
ways than the general population.  Many indigenous peoples are reliant on a subsistence-
based lifestyle.  Consumption and use of aquatic resources not only meets basic nutritional 
and economic needs, but also provides resources for cultural, traditional, and religious 
purposes (Maybee 2001).  Fish stocks and water quality are linked to the health of an 
ecosystem and to the activities that occur in the watershed.  NIS can impact both fish species 
and water quality, causing disruptions to local food webs.  These disruptions can impact 
subsistence fishing and, in turn, the livelihoods of people who rely on it. 
 
Impacts to Commercial Fishing, Recreational Fishing, and Water-Dependent Tourism 
 
Invasions of NIS are capable of disrupting commercial and recreational fisheries and 
adversely affecting local and regional economies. NIS can degrade water-dependent tourism 
and recreational activities associated with fishing, boating, swimming, and scuba diving. 
 
The domestic commercial fish and shellfish industry, which obtains its catch from many 
fresh and saltwater sources, including the Columbia River, the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans, and the Gulf of Mexico, contributes $45 billion to the U.S. economy 
annually (ERS 2004). This contribution reflects not only direct economic effects—the value 
of the fish and shellfish harvested—but also indirect effects, which include processing fish 
and shellfish for market, servicing the commercial fishing fleet, and repairing and 
maintaining commercial fishing gear.  
 
An example of costs to the local economy associated with NIS concerns Ohio’s $600 million 
Lake Erie sport fishery, which lost 50 to 65 percent of its value between 1985 and 1995. 
Possible reasons include an above-capacity walleye population in early 1982, a rapidly 
growing white perch population from 1985 to 1993, and the zebra mussel (Hushhak 1997).

Impacts to Public Health 
 
While the introduction of bacteria and viruses through ballast water is a growing concern, 
potential public health impacts remain virtually unexplored by scientists (Ruiz et al. 2000b).  
Concentrations of bacteria and viruses in ballast water have been found at very high levels—
up to six to eight times higher than those for other taxonomic groups in ballast water—
suggesting that invasions may be relatively common (Carlton and Geller 1993; Drake et al. 
2001; Drake et al. 2002; Ruiz et al. 2000b).  For example, human pathogen microorganisms 
are common in coastal waters and have been found in the ballast water of vessels (Ruiz et al. 
2000b).  
 
During the 1997 and 1998 shipping seasons, samples were taken from the ballast tanks of 28 
transoceanic vessels (Knight et al. 1999; Reynolds et al. 1999; Zo et al. 1999).  The sampling 
revealed the presence of a host of microorganisms, many of which are human pathogens, 
including fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, clostridium, salmonella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, 
cryptosporidium, giardia, and enteroviruses.  The presence of these organisms demonstrated 
the survival of human pathogens during transoceanic transport of ballast water.  It has been 
shown that certain microbial organisms can survive and become successfully established 
following BWD, thereby becoming vectors for human exposure. 
 
The global increase in HAB via BWD poses an increased risk to human health.  Some algal 
species contain powerful toxins, which can adversely affect fish, birds, and humans through 
the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish.  Paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrheic 
shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, and 
ciguatera fish poisoning are associated with natural toxins produced by HAB-forming 
diatoms and dinoflagellates. 
 
5.2 Economic Impacts of Past NIS 
 
Reporting on the costs in NIS invasions is almost an industry in itself. Despite the difficulty 
of obtaining economic estimates of the costs of aquatic introductions (Randall and Gollamudi 
2001), such figures are widely published. The importance of these estimates is that they 
establish the scale of the costs in comparison with the costs of meeting a BWDS. Ultimately, 
the quantified and monetized benefits of more stringent standards lie in the reduction of the 
costs of invasions such as those described herein. 
 
The U.S. EPA (Lovell and Stone 2005) has published a literature review on NIS and has 
noted the weaknesses of the currently available estimates: “Current empirical estimates are 
not comprehensive enough to determine the national or regional economic impacts of aquatic 
invasives.  Additionally, the realm of impact categories differs across the scale of analysis 
and methods of estimation.  By and large, there are few estimates of the non-market impacts 
using known methods.” (Lovell et al 2006). 
 
In the absence of a comprehensive estimate of the economic impacts due to invasive aquatic 
species, we review the literature on the existing estimates and develop a range of 
costs/impacts on a per species basis to characterize potential economic impacts of preventing

future NIS invasions.  The following discussion summarizes some of the available estimates 
of costs and damages related to past invasions, with more detailed information presented in 
Appendix D. 
 
A landmark assessment of the losses from selected NIS (Table 5.1) was made in 1993 by the 
U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment (OTA 1993).

the United States.” 
 
In the above table, the cumulative losses due to selected fish and aquatic invertebrates total 
nearly $1.7 billion. Other costs are not easily assigned to marine sources; however, the 
marine contribution is significant. In particular, the costs associated with non-native aquatic 
plants are notable. O’Neill (2000) has estimated the damages costs of the Zebra Mussel 
(Dreissena spp.) introduction in the U.S and obtained amounts between $750 million and $1 
billion for the period 1989–2000. 
 
In the most extensive review to date on the economic costs of introduced species in the U.S., 
Pimentel et al. (2005) covers estimates for many types of NIS. As part of an overall estimate 
that includes both direct and indirect cost of $120 billion annually, they include $7.8 billion 
associated with damages and costs of controlling aquatic invaders. Aquatic contributions are 
broken down as follows.

The potential negative economic impact caused by aquatic invasive fish species has not been 
studied to the extant such that direct and indirect costs resulting from invasions can be 
quantified, nor is there very much data to support prevailing assumptions about the costs of 
invasions. In one study, an estimate of $5.7 billion is given for annual fish related costs 
(Pimentel 2005).  This study defines cost in terms of losses to commercial and sports fishing 
in the Great Lakes and other U.S. inland waters. Two invasive species in particular are nearly 
always cited on this subject – the Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and the Sea lamprey 
(Petromyzon marinus).  The Ruffe came from Europe via ballast water in the 1980’s and the 
Sea lamprey migrated naturally. Both species prey on other fish and compete for habitat.  In 
two studies on these species, losses were quantified in terms of future angler days lost due to 
decreases in fishing population (Leigh 1998 and Lupi et al 2003).  While these two studies 
(which do not quantify costs in terms of actual expenditures) by themselves cannot be used to 
support the above figure of $5.7 billion, they underline one of the primary economic 
concerns to environmentalists regarding aquatic invasions, which is that they have the 
potential to cause significant harm to native fish populations and aquatic ecosystems. 
 
The economic costs associated with mollusk infestation to U.S. waters has been estimates at 
as high as $1 billion per year in direct cost for Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) 
(O’Neill 1997), and $1 billion per year for Asian Clams (Corbicula fluminea) (Pimentel et al. 
2005).  The origin of Zebra Mussel is the Caspian Sea.  Scientist believe that the introduction 
of Zebra Mussels occurred through ballast water discharged into the Great Lakes during the 
early part of the 1980’s.  Their high rate of reproduction has enabled Zebra Mussels’ colonies 
to spread quickly throughout U.S. waters. 
 
The Asiatic Clam like the Zebra Mussel is believed to have entered U.S. costal waters 
through ballast water discharge.  The first reported infestation of Asiatic Clams was 
discovered in San Francisco Bay during the early 1980’s. Like the Zebra Mussels, the Asiatic 
Clam colonization around the openings of drainage pipes and siphoning pipes have caused 
damages to industrial facilities.   
 
Aquatic weeds, in particular the Hydrilla weed (Hydrilla verticillata) which is “native to 
warmer areas of Asia, was first discovered in the U.S. in 1960….in Florida” (Langeland K.A. 
1996). Most damages caused by this weed are the blocking of irrigation, drainage canals, and 
the entanglement of propeller blades.

Shipworms (Teredo navalis) are not worms, but an elongated clam that feeds on and lives 
inside wooden structure. The destruction of wooden structures by Shipworm begins during 
the larval stage (Chesapeake Bay Program 2008) which makes detection of the infestation 
impossible until the damage has all ready done. Damage is usually done to wooden boats and 
piers that are untreated. 
 
The first European Green Crab (Carcinus maenas) was reported in North America in 1817 
along the Atlantic Coast. (Prince William Sound Regional Citizen’s Advisory Council 2004). 
The crab was then introduced to the west coast during the 1980’s through ballast water. 
Damage from the Green Crabs is seen in the disappearance of native species, due in part to 
the aggressive nature of these crabs. 
 
5.3 Benefits of Ballast Water Discharge Standards  
 
This section describes the benefits likely to occur from the establishment of a BWDS.  The 
standard’s main goal is the prevention of future NIS invasions.  Prevention of future NIS 
invasions will also prevent the negative impacts of such invasions, including loss of 
biodiversity, damage to water-dependent infrastructure, and impacts on commercial fishing, 
recreational fishing, water-dependent tourism, public health, and subsistence populations.  
We use estimates of costs associated with past NIS invasions to estimate benefits of 
preventing future invasions.  The estimates of costs resulting from past invasions are derived 
from a selection of studies that vary in which types of costs are covered by the study and 
often vary on the time period and the geographic region covered by the study.  Most often 
these studies include costs to control invasive species, with damages to infrastructure and 
impacts on fishing and tourism occasionally included.  We are unable to quantify potential 
benefits associated with ecological damages such as loss of biodiversity, impacts to public 
health and impacts on subsistence populations.  
 
Further, the majority of the studies analyzed are not specific on the entities directly affected 
by the NIS damages, making the identification of the portion of benefits that are transfer 
payments difficult.  We discuss this issue in greater detail in Section 5.9. 
 
We start the discussion of potential benefits a BWDS by presenting information on the 
functional benefits of the standard.  We then project the number of expected future invasions 
and the portion of invasions prevented by the standard.  We present an analysis of the range 
of potential cost per species and the estimated total damages of future species, as well as the 
potential benefits of the standard.  Finally, we discuss potential transfers and uncertainties 
inherent in our estimates.   
 
5.4 Functional Benefits of the Ballast Water Standards 
 
Although it is difficult to determine monetary measures of the benefits of controlling NIS, we 
can assess the functional benefits. The primary functional benefits of the second alternative 
standard (BWD-2) are: 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
84 
• A reduction in the concentration of organisms greater than 50 microns in size, leading 
to lower numbers of these organisms being introduced per discharge. 
• A reduction in the concentration of organisms in the 10–50 micron size range for 
ballast water that was initially rich in organisms. 
• A general reduction in concentrations from BWM values due to the practical 
requirements of meeting an upper bound standard.   
• A consistent upper bound on number of organisms (of all sizes) introduced for a 
given discharge size. 
• The potential to reduce the survivability of organisms that have been present in 
sediments in NOBOB vessels that subsequently take on ballast. This applies to 
systems that maintain a toxic environment in the ballast tank during the voyage. 
• Elimination of the exemptions in the BWM regulations leading to discharge of 
unmanaged ballast water (e.g., safety concerns during exchange, delay of voyage 
required to travel to acceptable mid-ocean exchange location). The elimination of 
these exemptions is significant, because they often lead to discharge of large amounts 
of untreated ballast water. Large inoculations (i.e., large number of organisms in a 
discharge) are linked positively to the risk of invasions (Minton et al. 2005, Ruiz et al. 
2000a, and others). In 2005, 7.7 million cubic meters of ballast was discharged from 
vessels from outside the EEZ that did not travel further than 200 miles from shore and 
thus were unable to perform mid-ocean exchange. This represents about 19 percent of 
the ballast discharged from vessels whose ballast originated outside the EEZ. 
 
This overall strategy should reduce the number of new invasions because the likelihood of 
establishment increases with the number of organisms introduced per discharge or 
inoculation (Ruiz et al. 2000a, Minton et al. 2005). 
 
The more stringent discharge standards (BWD-3 and BWD-4 at 1/10 and 1/100 concentration 
levels, respectively) further strengthen these benefits. Inoculation sizes will decrease in 
proportion to the reduction in concentrations. This reduces the chance of invasion, but the 
effects are extremely uncertain. There is evidence that probability of invasion reduces 
asymptotically with reduction in concentration (Tamburri 2005). 
 
Zero discharge standards, if achievable, would effectively eliminate the introduction of 
invasive species into ballast water. 
 
5.5 Annual Number of Invasions Due to Ballast Water Discharge 
 
Rate of Future Invertebrate Invasions  
 
To assist in assessing the benefit of BWDS, we first estimate the number of invasions 
introduced by BWD from shipping. The approach is based on the invasion rate of 
invertebrates from shipping reported by Ruiz et al. (2000) to estimate an approximated 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
85 
number of invasions per year. The authors compiled data on past marine invasions of 
invertebrates and algae in North America from 1790 to 2000. The authors found 298 
invertebrate and algae NIS in the coastal waters of North America, with an additional 76 
instances in which a species has spread to more than one coast (designated as repeat 
invaders).  The authors note that these estimates likely understate the number of actual 
invertebrate and algae invasions: “Our data provide only minimum estimates for established 
invasions of marine invertebrates and algae.  We have excluded consideration of boundary 
residents and cryptogenic28 species from our estimates, and the latter group may include 
hundreds of NIS that have gone unrecognized as such.  Furthermore, many sites and taxa 
within North America have received little scrutiny” (Ruiz et al. 2000). 
 
Ruiz et al characterized the mechanism for introduction of invasions and found that 62 
percent of the invasions over the most recent 30-year period studied (1970 – 2000) were due 
to shipping.  An additional 15 percent of invasions had shipping as one of the potential 
mechanisms, often with fishing as the other potential mechanism.   
 
The authors also calculated the rate of invasions due solely to shipping based on historical 
invasion data (i.e., the number of invasions by time period back to 1790).  The authors derive 
a “best fit mathematical model” to characterize the historical trend in invasions.  The best fit 
model is an exponential function which is represented by the equation: )024.0(127.1 xey ⋅= , 
where x is time in 30-year intervals since 1790.29   
 
We assume that this historical trend in invasions will continue in the future.  We use this 
equation to project the number of invasions per year due to shipping for our evaluation 
period of 2012 to 2021 (see Table 5.4).  Since this equation does not include the 15 percent 
of invasions in which shipping was one of several potential mechanisms, this approach is 
likely to underestimate the actual number of invasions that are the result of shipping 
activities. 
 
Rate of Future Fish and Aquatic Plant Invasions 
 
The Ruiz et al analysis includes only invasions of invertebrate and algae species: “Although 
our analysis is restricted to invertebrates and algae, it is noteworthy that at least 100 species 
of non-indigenous fish and 200 species of non-indigenous vascular plants are know to be 
established within this coastal area” (Ruiz et al 2000). To account for the additional number 
of fish and plant invasions that are expected to occur, we use the results of the Ruiz et al 
2000 model to estimate the number of fish and plant invasions per year, based on historical 
data on the relationship of invasions for different specie groups.  Table 5.3 summarizes the 
results of previous studies that characterized invasions for specific bodies of water. 
 
                                                 
28 Cryptogenic – not clearly native or introduced 
29  The model shape (the exponential function) means that as time progresses, the rate of invasions increases 
greater than a simple linear relationship. In this equation, the values of 1.127 and 0.024 are constants that define 
the shape of the trend line (similar to the slope in a linear equation).  The variable of x is a measure of time, 
specifically time in 30-year intervals since 1790.

In two of the studies, the percent of invasive fish species was roughly equal to the number of 
invertebrates and the number of plant species was roughly 3 times the number of 
invertebrates.  The third study employed a more strict criteria for inclusion of plant species 
and found that the number of plant species was 40 percent of the number of invertebrates and 
fish species were roughly 20 percent of the number of invertebrates.  We use these two sets 
of relationships to project the annual number of invasive fish and plant species as displayed 
in Table 5.4.  For the purposes of estimating economic impacts of invasions, we use the 
number of fish and aquatic plant invasions that result from Relationship 2 (i.e., aquatic plants 
are 40 percent of invertebrates and fish are 20 percent).

Fraction of Shipping Invasions Due to Ballast Water 
 
Ballast water discharge is one of the two main vectors associated with shipping—hull fouling 
being the other. These proposed discharge standards will not address hull fouling, so the 
fraction of invasions associated with hull fouling needs to be removed from our estimates of 
future invasions. 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
87 
 
There are competing factors with regard to the influence of hull fouling versus BWD. On the 
one hand, reductions in the impact of hull fouling are expected as fuel costs continue to 
increase in overall importance and more attention is paid to maintaining non-fouled bottoms. 
Further, the trend to larger ships results in more volume for a given hull surface area, thus 
increasing the relative importance of ballast discharge as a vector. 
 
Reduced toxicity of bottom paint, improved water quality, creation of new harbor facilities, 
vessel activities (e.g., vessels that remain in place for long periods), biological triggers, and 
other factors (Minchin 2002) suggest that hull fouling may become a more significant vector. 
One contributing factor to this scenario is that NIS have a higher survivability rate on hulls 
than in ballast tanks.  
 
Past analyses of ballast water and hull fouling indicate that the rate of shipping invasions due 
to ballast water could be as high as 63 percent (Mills, et al. 1993) and as low as 10 percent.  
The relative impact of ballast water and hull fouling vectors has not been fully understood 
(Ruiz 2002). 
 
In a recent analysis of historical invertebrate invasions, Fofonoff, et al. (2003) classified 
nonnative species (invertebrates, algae and fish) associated with shipping to assess the 
likelihood of invasion by the subvectors based on traits such as life history, etc.  Table 5.5 
summarized the results of the Fofonoff et al. (2003) analysis:

Based on this analysis, 20 percent of invasions are solely attributed to ballast water, while 
another 34 percent of invasions could be attributable to either ballast water or hull fouling.  If 
we assume none of the “Either Ballast Water or Hull Fouling” invasions was due to ballast 
water, then 20 percent of shipping invasions are due to ballast water.  Similarly, if we assume 
that all of the “Either Ballast Water or Hull Fouling” are due to ballast water, the resulting 
fraction of ballast water invasions is 54 percent.  If we assume that the “Either Ballast Water 
or Hull Fouling” invasions are distributed proportionally, then ballast water accounts for 32 
percent of invasions.  Table 5.6 presents the potential number of invasions per year from 
2012 to 2021 assuming 22 percent, 32 percent, and 48 percent of shipping invasions are 
attributable to ballast water.  For the purposes of our main analysis, we assume that 32 
percent of shipping invasions are attributable to ballast water.

Fofonoff et al. 2003 also evaluated temporal changes in the shipping vectors and found that 
ballast water invasions appear to be growing at a faster rate over the past 30 years in 
comparison to hull fouling invasions, although there is considerable uncertainty due to the 
relatively large number of invasions that could not be definitively classified. 
 
Fraction of Invasions That Cause Harm 
 
Further, not all invasions will cause harm.  According to Windle 1997: “On average, 15 
percent of foreign species trigger severe economic or financial damage and about 40 percent 
cause some harm.”  For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that 15 percent of the 
invasions will cause economic damage, a figure that is also in line with the findings of the 
OTA 1993 assessment.   We note that we may be underestimating the number of harmful 
species by not including all or some fraction of the 40 percent of species that may cause 
some harm.  As seen in Table 5.7, during the period of 2012-2021, 4.1 invertebrate invasions, 
0.8 fish invasions, and 1.7 aquatic plant invasions due to ballast water are expected to cause 
severe economic or financial damage.

5.6 Costs of Ballast Water Invasions  
 
As discussed earlier, no comprehensive estimate is available on the costs from past invasions.  
Most studies focus on one species and often only consider certain types of costs or costs in 
certain regions, resulting in a wide variability of estimates.  For this reason, we do not try to 
develop a composite cost estimate for all invasions, but instead select a low and high estimate 
for fish, aquatic plants and invertebrates based on representative species.  We then calculate a 
mid-point for the range and calculate costs for future invasions using all three values. 
 
Appendix E contains a summary of available cost estimates for invasions and a discussion 
documenting the choice of the low and high range cost estimates per species.  Table 5.8 
displays the range of values used in subsequent calculations.

We assume that once an invasion is established, it will continue to generate costs and/or 
damages for each year subsequent to the invasion.  Thus, an invasion that occurs in the first 
year of our analysis (2012) will incur costs/damages in each of the next 10 years (through 
2021). 
 
Based on the cumulative impacts of invasions, we have calculated a mid-range estimate of 
annual costs for all harmful BW-introduced invasions over the 10 year period of 2012 to 
2021 at $2.016 billion (7 percent) assuming that ballast water invasions represent 32 percent 
of shipping invasions. The annual cost of ballast water invasion for the period of 2012 to 
2021 varies from approximately $75 million to $3.957 billion based on the range of 
estimated costs per invasions as shown on Table 5.9 at 7 percent discount rate. This estimate 
assumes no ballast water management.

5.7 Benefits (Averted Costs) of Ballast Water Discharge Standards 
 
This section describes the main benefits likely to occur from the establishment of BWDS.  
The standards main goal is the prevention of future NIS invasions. The value of the benefits 
for each alternative considered varies based on a particular alternative’s effectiveness in 
preventing future invasions. The Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement 
(DPEIS)30 has estimated the reduction in the mean rate of successful introductions of various 
alternative standards.  As described in detail in Appendix A of the DPEIS, a mathematical 
model was developed based on the premise that a decrease in the number of living organisms 
initially introduced through ballast water discharges into a waterway reduces the probability 
that a population becomes successfully established.  The researchers first develop a model of 
the simplest case in which a single species is discharged during a ballast water discharge 
event (referred to as a single species model).  The researchers then used this simple model to 
develop a more complex model representing a situation where multiple species are 
discharged from a vessel (referred to as the multi-species model).  The multiple species 
model is the appropriate model to use for the calculation of benefits as it is the more 
ecologically realistic scenario.31 
 
The goal of the multi-species model is to estimate the probability that a single ballast water 
discharge containing multiple invasive species in different concentrations will result in at

least one successful introduction of an invasive species. The BWDS in Alternatives 2 through 
5 are intended to decrease the probability of NIS establishment by reducing the number of 
individual organisms that are introduced via BWD.  The alternatives differ in the degree to 
which they would prevent introduction of individual organisms in different size classes and 
hence, the degree to which they increase extinction probability of NIS.  The multi-species 
model is used to estimate the probability of a successful invasive species introduction for 
Alternatives 2 through 4.  The probability of introductions for each Alternative is compared 
against the baseline probability of introduction to calculate the reduction in the probability of 
introduction attributable to that Alternative. 32 
 
The DPEIS developed two different baselines based on different assumptions about current 
ballast water management practices.  One baseline assumes that no ballast water management 
is being practiced and the other assumes that ballast water exchange takes place.  To estimate 
benefits, we use the ballast water exchange baseline as most ocean-going vessels are 
currently required to conduct ballast water exchange.  However, some of the vessels engaged 
in coastal traffic do not conduct ballast water exchange.  For these vessels, the no ballast 
water management assumption may be the more appropriate baseline.  For the purposes of 
this analysis of benefits, we are unable to separate out the invasion risk associated with 
different classes of vessels and therefore use the conservative assumption that all vessels are 
conducting ballast water exchange. 
 
Table 5.10 presents the reduction in the mean rate of invasions that would result from 
Alternatives 2 through 4.  In comparison with the existing practice of ballast water exchange, 
Alternative 2 is between 37 percent to 63 percent effective in preventing invasions when 
fully implemented. 33 Please refer to the DPEIS for further information on the derivation of 
these estimates. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
32 Alternative 5 is basically sterilization which results in a 100% reduction in invasions. 
33 The range in effectiveness is the result of different assumptions as to the threshold below which a population 
is considered extinct for the purposes of invasive species.  For example, a Ne=1 in Table 5.10 assumes that all 
organisms of a particular species have to be eradicated for species to be unable to colonize the new environment 
(i.e., the new waterway).  For many species, however, a certain population size is necessary for successful 
colonization.  Thus, the analysis in the DPEIS also uses a threshold of 100, meaning that 100 organisms of a 
species would need to survive for the invasion to be successful (Ne=100).  Please refer to Appendix A of the 
DPEIS for further explanation.

Applying these reductions in our projected number of harmful ballast water invasions results 
in the invasions avoided displayed in Table 5.11a.  Based on this data, Alternative 2 is 
estimated to prevent between 2.5 and 4.2 harmful ballast water invasions over a 10-year 
period, an average of .25 to .42 invasions avoided per year.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the implementation of the Alternative 2 Ballast Water Discharge 
Standard will be phased-in over several years.  During the phase-in period of 2012-2015, 
there is considerable uncertainty as to how effective the measures will be in preventing 
invasions if only a subset of ships have implemented ballast water treatment.  There is also 
uncertainty as to the availability and effectiveness of ballast water treatment technologies.  
For these reasons, we conservatively assume that no invasions will be avoided during the 
phase-in period of 2012-2015, which may lead to an underestimate of potential benefits.  The 
resulting schedule of invasions avoided for the Alternative 2 Ballast Water Treatment 
Standard is displayed in Table 5.11b.

5.8 Potential Benefits Transfer 
 
The estimates of costs avoided by preventing NIS invasions encompass many categories of 
losses, some of which may represent a potential transfer of benefits.  Some of the categories 
of losses that are included in the avoided costs include: 
 
• Costs to control non-indigenous species 
• Damage to infrastructure and resulting losses 
• Loss of both commercial and recreational fishery resources 
• Loss of recreation and tourism opportunities 
 
Losses of natural or capital resources are generally not considered transfers.  Thus, control 
costs, damage to infrastructure, and loss of fishery resources are not likely to be transfers, 
although lost business resulting from damaged infrastructure may be a transfer.  Loss of 
recreation and tourism opportunities may be a transfer if the recreational user substituted 
another form of recreation or participated in the same activity at a different location.  Under 
the presumption that the original recreational experience was the first choice of the user, the 
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
97 
alternative recreational opportunities would not have the same value as the primary choice of 
activity with the difference representing a net economic loss.  
 
It is difficult to comprehensively ascertain the portion of the calculated benefits in each 
category in order to break out potential transfers.  Many of the estimates of costs per species 
simply do not provide sufficient detail to divide costs into the categories. In addition, the 
distribution of costs by category differ from invasive specie to specie.  A few studies have 
provided specie-specific information of costs or damages by category.  For example, O’Neill 
1997 surveyed infrastructure owners on their expenditures on zebra-mussel related activities.  
Only about 1.1 percent of the zebra mussel expenditures were related to recreation or 
tourism.  The majority of the expenditures were related to water treatment plants and electric 
power generation facilities. Pimentel 2005 estimated that about 16 percent of economic 
impacts (damages and control costs) from mussels in the New York State Canal and Hudson 
River system were related to tourism or recreation.  On the other hand, Pimentel 2005 
estimates that 50 percent of the impacts from invasive fish species in this region are related to 
tourism or recreational activities such as sport fishing.  Based on this limited information, 
some portion of the estimated benefits from preventing future invasions may represent 
transfers, but the amount will vary widely depending on the nature of the specie and extent of 
the invasions. 
 
5.9 Sources of Uncertainties and Alternative Use of Risk-Based Decision-
Making in Addressing Benefits 
 
The environmental repercussions of undertaking a specific policy are frequently unknown. 
The framework of environmental policy is typified by uncertainty concerning the effect and 
irreversibility of some effects. The explicit difference between risk and uncertainty is that 
risk refers to situations where the nature of the probability distribution of future events is 
known, while uncertainty refers to situations where the probabilities are unknown (Hosking 
& du Preez, 2004). The problem of uncertainty in cost-benefit analysis may be addressed, to 
some extent, through sensitivity analysis as changes are made to particularly important 
variables. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis should not be the only tool used to evaluate 
decisions when uncertainties affect the mainstream issues in the analysis. 
 
The damage and benefit analyses are based on assumptions regarding a number of inputs, 
which introduces uncertainty into the resulting estimates.  Table 5.13 summarizes some of 
the assumptions underlying the analyses and assesses the likely impact of the assumptions on 
the estimates of damages and benefits.

6 Comparison of Costs and Benefits 
 
6.1 Comparison of Costs and Benefits of Ballast Water Discharge 
Standards 
 
Comparison of Potential Benefits with Costs 
 
The annualized cost for domestic vessels over the 10-year period of 2012-2021 for 
Alternative 2 is estimated at $167 million34 at a 7 percent discount rate.   The estimate of 
quantified benefits for Alternative 2 ranges from $6 million to $553 million per year (see 
Figure 6.1), with a mid-point of $165-$282 million per year at a 7 percent discount rate.  
Thus, quantified benefits are roughly equal to estimated costs for mid-point benefits estimate 
of Alternative 2 Low Effectiveness.  The high range annual cost estimate of $307 million is 
roughly equal to the high range benefits estimate of Alternative 2 Low Effectiveness. 
Additional benefits to the areas of ecological damages such as loss of biodiversity, impacts to 
public health and impacts on subsistence populations are expected to accrue due to BWDS 
proposed in the rulemaking, but cannot be quantified at this time.  Benefits may also accrue 
due to reduced invasions in foreign ports.  However, we do not include either benefits in 
foreign waters or costs to foreign vessels in our primary analysis as these will mainly be 
attributable to foreign vessels complying with treaty obligations of their flag administration 
(government) under IMO.

Installation costs to meet BWD-3 and BWD-4 standards are estimated to be higher, on the 
order of two and three times BWD-2 costs, respectively. Effectiveness in controlling NIS 
invasions will also be higher as displayed in Table 5.10.  The range of potential benefits for 
Alternatives 3 and 4 (Table 5.12) are in general less than two to three times higher than 
Alternative 2, possibly indicating that the cost to benefit comparisons would be less favorable

for these Alternatives.  However, the range of uncertainty in both the cost and effectiveness 
assessments for these standards makes it difficult to conclusively draw comparisons. 
 
Other phase-in schedules under consideration are in agreement with the IMO schedule after 
2016; thus, costs after 2016 will be similar for similar BWD standards. The alternative under 
consideration by the Coast Guard incorporates the higher BWD-4 standard after 2016 and 
thus costs will be higher. 
 
Invasions Prevented to Reach Breakeven 
 
We can roughly assess the threshold at which the benefits of BWD outweigh the costs in 
terms of how many invasions must be prevented.  Based on the analysis presented in Chapter 
5, Alternative 2 prevents between 0.15 to 0.26 harmful NIS invasions per year, assuming no 
invasions are avoided during the phase-in period.  Zebra mussels are at least the second 
instance of a NIS that attacked water-based infrastructure with costs in the billions of 
dollars—the Asiatic clam preceded it. If an invasion generating the costs associated with the 
Zebra mussel invasion of the 1990s or the Asiatic clam invasion of the 1980s is preventable, 
then BWD standards are clearly cost-effective.   
 
Based on our projected invasions avoided, the breakeven point (discounted cumulative 
benefits equal or outweigh discounted cumulative costs) would be reached by 2019 for the 
Alternative 2 assuming a 63 percent reduction in the invasion rate and 2021 for Alternative 2 
assuming a low reduction in invasion rate of 37 percent.  Figure 6.2 illustrates the cumulative 
costs of the BWD in relationship to the damages avoided.

6.2 Potential Total Cost Variation due to Changes in Compliance with the 
Phase-In Schedule 
 
Under the proposed rulemaking, all vessels will be required to convert to BWT by the end of 
2016.  Some vessels will be required to convert by the end of 2014.  The vessels that have the 
early conversion deadline are those with a ballast water capacity of greater than 1,500 and 
less than 5,000 cubic meters.  These will be referred to below as type 2 vessels.  The 
remaining vessels will be referred to as type 1 vessels.  We have calculated three different 
conversion rate scenarios in order to determine the present value (PV) of the future costs of 
the rule.  The first scenario in table 6.1 is the one used in the cost chapter (chapter 4) of this 
RA.  It assumes that type 1 vessels will begin converting in the year 2012 at a rate of 20 
percent of the fleet per year, through 2016.  For type 2 vessels under this scenario, the rate is 
30 percent in 2012 and 2013, and 40 percent in 2014.  The PV for this scenario is $1.349 
billion using a 3 percent discount rate.

The second scenario in table 6.2 assumes that each firm will wait as long as possible to 
convert, with 100 percent of type 1 vessels converting in 2016 and 100 percent of type 2 
vessels converting in 2014.  The PV for this scenario is $1.297 billion using a 3 percent 
discount rate.

The difference between the PV (at 3 percent) of the rulemaking total costs varies from $1.349 
billion to $1.297 billion, depending whether the vessels owners decide to comply earlier or 
later in the process.  The difference between the timing of compliance results in a difference 
of approximately 4 percent of the total annual cost of this rulemaking. 
 
6.3 Comparison between Ballast Water Exchange (BWE) and proposed 
Ballast Water Discharge Standard (BWDS) 
 
Alternative 1, No Action, option continues existing ballast water exchange requirements for 
vessels equipped with ballast water tanks that enter the U.S. after operating beyond the EEZ.  
In this scenario, existing BWM regulations would continue and management achieved 
through BWE using the methods of empty/refill or flow-through.  The BWM RA (USCG 
2004) estimated annual cost for BWE to be $15.8 million (USCG 2004). However, the 
amount of ballast water exchange reported in the NBIC data collected recently is much 
smaller than that assumed in the BWM RA.  Thus, we have re-estimated that cost of ballast 
water exchange as described in Appendix B at $5 million per year.  As of 2016, vessels that 
were conducting ballast water exchange would no longer incur these costs as they comply 
with the ballast water discharge standard. 
 
The annualized cost for Alternative 2 is estimated at $167 million at 7 percent discount.  It 
should be noted that the BWM requirements apply to a subset of vessels that fall under the 
BWDS. Specifically, vessels engaged in coast-wise traffic that do no leave the EEZ are not 
subject to the BWM requirements.  Hence, when making direct comparisons of the costs of 
BWM and the BWDS, we should keep in mind that more vessels are treating ballast water, 
resulting in greater reductions in the risk of invasions.  For example, Alternative 2 is 
expected to result in a 37-63 percent reduction in the mean rate of successful invasions with 
potential avoided costs of $165-$282 million.

7 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  
 
7.1 Summary of Findings 
 
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has performed this initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the 
impacts on small businesses and other entities from the 2008 NPRM for Standards for Living 
Organisms in Ship’s Ballast Water Discharged in U.S. Waters.  We have performed this 
assessment using the cost information discussed in chapter 4. We have determined that the 
rule will result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  
 
Based on the information from this analysis, we found:  
 
• There are an estimated 850 U.S. businesses that would be affected by the rulemaking, 
these businesses operate 2,616 vessels affected by the rule; 
• It is estimated that of these 850 firms, 57 percent are considered small; 
• These firms will be required to purchase and install a ballast water management 
system for each affected vessel they own, costing between $258,000 and $419,000 
per vessel, depending on the vessel type; 
• We have assumed that firms will finance the purchase of this equipment and therefore 
we have used the annual payment to service the loan as the annual cost for 
installation; 
• Annual recurring operational costs of the rule result in less than 1% impact on 
revenue for 100 percent of the firms;  
• For a 10-year finance scenario, we estimated 72 percent of small firms would incur an 
annual cost impact greater than 1 percent of annual revenue.   
• For a 20-year finance scenario, we estimated 59 percent of small firms would incur an 
annual cost impact greater than 1 percent of annual revenue. 
 
7.2 Preliminary Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-354) (RFA) establishes “as a 
principle of regulatory issuance that agencies shall endeavor, consistent with the objectives 
of the rule and of applicable statutes, to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the 
scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.  
To achieve this principle, agencies are required to solicit and consider flexible regulatory 
proposals and to explain the rationale for their actions to assure that such proposals are given 
serious consideration.”   
 
Under the RFA, we are required to consider if this rule will have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Agencies must perform a review to 
determine whether a rule will have such an impact.  If the agency determines that it will, the 
agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis as described in the RFA. 
Under Section 603(b) of the RFA, the regulatory flexibility analysis must provide and or 
address:   
DRAFT PRELIMINARY REGULATORY ANALYSIS: DO NOT CITE, QUOTE OR DISTRIBUTE 
 
 
104 
 
• A description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered; 
 
• A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule; 
 
• A description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to 
which the proposed rule will apply; 
 
• A description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance 
requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small 
entities which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills 
necessary for preparation of the report or record;  
 
• An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may 
duplicate, overlap or conflict with the proposed rule; and,  
 
• A description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish 
the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant 
economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities. 
 
The RFA covers a wide-range of small entities.  The term “small entities” comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are 
not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
50,000.  We determined that the rule affects a variety of large and small businesses, not-for-
profit organizations, and governments (see the “Description of the Potential Number of Small 
Entities” section below).  Based on the requirements above, we have prepared the following 
regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact on small entities from the rule. 
 
7.3 Description of the Reasons for Agency Action 
 
The unintentional introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) into the waters of the United 
States via the discharge of ships’ ballast water continues to contribute to the loss of marine 
biodiversity and to lead to significant social, economic, and biological impacts. Current U.S. 
regulations require ballast water management (BWM) to reduce introductions of NIS through 
ballast water discharge (BWD). Currently, the primary management method for controlling 
ballast water discharged in U.S. waters is a mid-ocean exchange of ballast water obtained 
from waters outside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Concern remains that this 
approach to ballast water management is not sufficiently effective in preventing the 
introduction of NIS nor can many vessels conduct ballast water exchange because of safety 
issues and or voyage constraints. The U.S. is proposing a rule to establish a ballast water 
discharge standard for the allowable concentrations of living organisms discharged via 
ballast water into U.S. waters.

7.4 Statement of Legal Basis and Objectives for the Rule 
 
The statutory authority for the Coast Guard to prescribe, change, revise, or amend the 
affected domestic regulation 33 CFR part 151 is provided under 16 U.S.C. 4711; as delegated 
to the Coast Guard in the Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. 
 
The objective for the rule is to reduce the probability of unintentional introduction of NIS 
into the waters of the United States via the discharge of ships’ ballast water. Reducing the 
probability will reduce the harmful biological and economic effects of NIS with the goal of 
reducing the number of NIS invasions and resulting biological impacts and economic losses. 
 
7.5 Description of Record Keeping and Other Compliance Requirements 
 
The rulemaking would not require additional reporting, recordkeeping, and other paperwork 
requirements for affected owners or operators. Vessel’s operators or person-in charge will 
comply with same reporting requirements of 33 CFR § 151.2041.  
 
7.6 Overlapping, Duplicative, or Conflicting Federal Rules 
 
Potential ballast water discharge standards would not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any 
other federal requirement. 
 
7.7 Costs of Compliance 
 
To estimate the compliance cost to small entities, we considered the cost for acquiring, 
installing, and operating a ballast water management system by vessel type.  The cost for 
acquiring and installing the system is summarized in Table 7.1 below. This assumes vessel 
owners will opt for the least expensive system available.35 There are many types of vessels 
that will be impacted by the rule, but we have found that the small businesses impacted by 
this rule operate only a few certain types, these being the smaller vessels in the population.  
Our analysis has determined that 92 percent of small-business vessels are either general 
cargo (mainly barges) or offshore supply vessels. Small firms will likely benefit from 
economies of scale as big firms equip their fleets, driving down installation costs. Therefore, 
there is a high probability that these figures are upper-bound estimates and that the actual 
installation costs will be significantly lowered once the rule goes into effect. Furthermore, 
these vessels are coastwise vessels and relatively small. They will perform considerably less 
ballast water treatment than will larger, ocean-going vessels.  The annual operating cost for 
these firms will be very low, as operational costs are based on quantity of water treated, and 
these vessels will be treating small quantities. 
                                                 
35 Chemical Apply is the lowest cost treatment in this study (see Chapter 3 for information on the treatment 
effectiveness).

7.8 Description of the Potential Number of Small Entities 
 
Based on current data provided by the Coast Guard’s Marine Information for Safety and Law 
Enforcement (MISLE) database, we estimate that there are approximately 850 U.S. entities 
operating 2,616 vessels affected by this rule.  
 
We used available operator name and address information to research public and proprietary 
databases for entity type (subsidiary or parent company), primary line of business, employee 
size, revenue, and other information.36  We matched this information to the Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) “Table of Small Business Size Standards” to determine if an entity is 
small in its primary line of business as classified in the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS).37  
 
We researched and compiled the employee size and revenue data for a random sample of 150 
operators.38  We were able to find employee size and revenue data for 136 operators in the 
sample (about 91 percent of the sample).  We determined that of these 136 operators, 71 
would be classified as small entities based on the SBA size standards.  Assuming that the 
companies with no information are small entities, we will have a total of 85 small companies 
in our sample, representing approximately 57 percent of our sample. 
 
We found small entities affected by this rule to have multiple business lines.  Some have a 
primary business line or NAICS code that is not unique to the maritime industry.  Table 7.2 
                                                 
36 We used information and data from Manta (http://Manta.com) and ReferenceUSA 
(http://www.referenceusa.com).   
37 The SBA lists small business size standards for industries described in the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS). See http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/fedgovernment/sba/13cfr121/201-
4849.html (as of  April 7,2008). 
38 We selected a statistical sample so we would not need to research and collect employee size and revenue 
information for the entire affected operator population.  We determined the sample size at a 95% confidence 
level with a 5% confidence interval.  We selected the operators in the sample through a random number 
generator process available in most statistical or spreadsheet software.

7.9 Cost and Affordability Impact Analysis 
 
The compliance cost incurred by operators depends on the number of affected vessels the 
operator owns and the annual ballast water discharge per vessel. We estimated the revenue 
impact for two finance periods, 10 and 20 years with a 7 percent annual interest.  We 
considered that less favorable financing terms, such as shorter loan durations or higher rates 
of interest, to the small entities is possible.  In those cases, the annual cost will be higher.  
Since the main cost driver of this rule is the BWT installation, we calculate the percent 
revenue impact by dividing the annual cost for the 10-year and 20-year finance (presented in 
Table 7.1) by average annual revenue. The costs are the payment to service the equipment 
loan, plus operational costs for the year.  
 
For the 10-year finance scenario, we estimate that 72 percent of small firms would incur an 
annual cost impact greater than 1 percent of annual revenue.  Table 7.3.a presents the range 
of cost impacts on annual revenue for potential small entities.

We also considered a 20-year finance scenario for companies to purchase and install the 
BWTS (see Table 7.3.b).  For this scenario, we estimated 59 percent of small firms would 
incur an annual cost impact greater than 1 percent of annual revenue.

7.10 Alternatives Considered 
 
We considered five regulatory alternatives, including a no action alternative, to achieve 
ballast water discharge standards. Each alternative, besides the no action, considered varying 
levels of stringency with regards to the concentration of NIS in ballast water. The least 
stringent alternative is the one being analyzed here.  This is the least expensive alternative 
after no action.  These alternatives are discussed in more detail in the other sections of the 
RA.

World Fleet Growth and Makeup 
 
Based on information provided by HEC, a BWDS would be phased in over the period from 
2012 to 2016 under the proposed U.S. and international regulations. During this period, the 
population of vessels will potentially change— some vessels would be removed and others 
will be constructed. We obtained estimates of growth and removal rates for the various vessel 
types from a number of sources. Primary sources are the Transportation Research Board 
(TRB) and the Maritime Administration (MARAD). We also consulted private sector 
information sources:  Clarkson Register, RS Platou for generalized fleet forecasts; PIERS, 
Mercator Transportation Management, Herbert Engineering Corp, and MDS Transmodal for 
container traffic forecasts; and the American Bureau of Shipping and ConocoPhillips for 
LNG forecasts. Appendix A contains additional details on Fleet Makeup. 
 
We extracted the number of affected vessels from the MISLE database to provide a baseline 
fleet size for year 2007. In projecting fleet growth, we assumed that there would be no 
optimization of the fleet for U.S. traffic. That is, we assumed that all vessels involved in 
international trade will be built to both U.S. and international BWDS requirements.  
 
In addition to growth in number of vessels, the size composition of the fleet is changing, 
especially in the LNG and container fleets. The relationship between ballast water capacity 
and vessel size (deadweight) is approximately linear (see Figures A-5, A-6 and A-7). 
Although the increased cargo may be carried on a fleet that is growing more slowly in 
numbers than in tonnage or TEU capacity, the assumption is made that the amount of ballast 
water discharged will grow with tonnage or TEU capacity. 
 
Table A.2 shows the assumed growth and removal rates forming the baseline case. We 
estimated the number of new builds each year by adding the number of vessels removed to 
the number of vessels needed to achieve the net growth rate.

LNG Fleet Growth Projections 
 
Bloomberg Report:  LNG Fleet Needs to Expand 66 percent  
 
The global fleet of tankers carrying liquefied natural gas needs to expand by 66 percent by 
2010 to meet current and future demand from exporters including Qatar, Australia and 
Nigeria, according to LNG Shipping Solutions, as reported by Bloomberg.  
 
About 205 carriers need to be ordered, adding to the 182 vessels in service and 127 units 
already contracted to be built, to meet demand for existing and future LNG projects. In 
addition, as many as 105 vessels need to be ordered to meet demand for future projects and 
100 vessels for current contracts.

Ballast Water Capacity as a Vessel Cargo Capacity for Various Vessel Types 
 
A key assumption in the assumed growth rates is that modeling growth in cargo carrying 
capacity (DWT, TEU or volume) correlates to growth in ballast water capacity and thus, 
discharge potential. The following figures demonstrate that this assumption is well-founded.

Appendix B Ballast Water Exchange (BWE) Cost46 
 
This appendix presents the calculation of the ballast water exchange (BWE) cost, baseline 
cost, based on the 2007 vessel information provided by the National Ballast Information 
Clearinghouse (NBIC) database. The baseline cost is equivalent to the Alternative 1 (No 
Action) described in this RA. We then compared the BWE costs the proposed BWDS, 
alternative 2 (see Chapter 6 for discussion).  
 
The direct costs of the current ballast water management practices (BWE) onboard vessels 
include the cost incurred by pumping additional ballast water and the cost of additional crew 
labor required to carry out the mid-ocean exchanges. Herbert Engineering Corp (HEC) 
estimated the pumping costs based on the cost of generating the electricity to run the ballast 
pump and the additional maintenance costs for the ballast pump and piping resulting from 
pumping more ballast. HEC assumed that no new equipment is required to comply with the 
rule. In determining the amount of ballast water involved in the exchange, three volumes of 
ballast tank capacity represents a complete flow-through (FT) exchange, while two volumes 
of the ballast tank capacity represents an empty/refill (ER) exchange.  
 
To determine pumping costs, HEC estimated the cost for pumping one cubic meter of ballast 
water. HEC used fluid mechanic equations to calculate the kilowatts (kW) of power required 
to pump one cubic meter of water against a typical ballast system pressure head of 25 m. 
Taking into account the efficiencies of the pumps, motors, and generators, HEC calculated 
that it takes 0.11 kW of generated power to pump one cubic meter per hour (m3/h) of ballast 
is pumped. Because most vessels have diesel generators, HEC based the cost estimate on 
generating power in this manner. Considering the fuel rates of typical diesel generators and a 
fuel cost of $620 per ton for marine diesel oil (MDO), and $300 per ton for heavy fuel oil 
(HFO), plus lube oil costs, the calculated cost per m3/h based on MDO fuel is $0.13 and 
based on HFO fuel is $0.07. As a rough order estimate, HEC assumed that half the vessels 
use MDO for generators and half use HFO; consequently, HEC estimated the average cost 
for powering the pumps to be $0.10 per m3/hr pumped. 
 
Another component in the calculation of cost of BWE is the additional maintenance cost 
incurred by the use of the ballast pumps and piping systems to carry out BWE. A reasonable 
estimate based on industry experience is that the average annual maintenance costs are 
approximately 10 percent of the ballast pump’s capital cost.47 In order to adequately account 
for the extra maintenance burden, a uniform annual maintenance cost of 10 percent of the 
capital cost of one ballast pump is added for each vessel conducting exchanges. HEC divide 
this cost by the estimated annual quantity of ballast pumped per year. HEC estimate the 
annual quantity of ballast pumped without BWE with the assumption that the pumps operate 
at rated capacity for 100 to 125 hours per year,48 increased by a factor of 2.5 on average by 
BWE (average factor of 2 for empty/refill and 3 for flow-through). HEC also assume this 
                                                 
46 Methodology and sources provided by Herbert Engineering Corporation, information updated to 2007.  
47 This number was also used in the BWM RA (USCG 2004).  Here it is refined to account only for those costs 
that truly depend upon the increased ballast pumped required by BWE.  
48 This estimate is based upon a review of typical numbers of voyages and amounts discharged across all vessel 
types.

maintenance cost covers replacement parts for pumps such as impellers, as well as 
maintenance of piping system components, such as pipes and valves. Approximately half of 
this maintenance cost is considered to be affected by increased flow through the system and 
half based on time of exposure to salt water by the system, which is unaffected by BWE. The 
maintenance cost affected by flow through the system is increased by 250 percent to account 
for BWE, and the total is divided by the estimated annual flow in the system to obtain the 
additional maintenance cost per cubic meter of ballast pumped for BWE. See Table B-1 for 
details on the maintenance cost calculations.

Because carrying out BWE doubles or triples the amount of time needed to empty and refill 
or flow-through ballast tanks and could require many hours of operation at sea, it is 
reasonable to add additional crew labor costs to this number.49 This factor recognizes that the 
crew could be doing other work during this time. The charges would be primarily for officers 
to oversee the ballasting and possibly for unlicensed crew if the vessel has manually-operated 
valves. The labor charges vary from very low cost50 to over $5051 per hour for U.S. or 
European officers.52 Table B-2 shows an estimated average labor cost for BWE and includes 
the cost for BWE labor per m3 of water. HEC assumed that no additional personnel would be 
added to the vessel to conduct BWE. For smaller vessels, it is assumed that less time is 
required for ballasting and less supervision is required compared to a large tanker or bulk 
carrier, where ballasting is a major operation.

This is the  mean wage rate, times the load rate of 40%, gave us approximately $50 load wage rate for U.S.

labor charges.

Note:  All costs are per m3 of ballast pumped 
 
Based on the above estimated cost per cubic meter of ballast pumped, HEC estimated the 
annual cost of BWE. While this estimate carries uncertainty, it provides a reasonable 
estimate of the magnitude of costs industry can expect to incur because of BWE. 
 
Ballast Water Exchange Practices 
 
The costs of BWE influence shipping operations. The NBIC data indicate how much ballast 
is managed through exchange; whether ER, FT, or alternative methods are used. Alternative 
methods as reported in the NBIC data can include treatment, mid-ocean filling, or 
undetermined methods. However, they represent only a small portion (<0.5 percent) of 
managed ballast water. 
 
Vessels that carry goods into the U.S. typically discharge little ballast. Imports and foreign 
goods dominate U.S. maritime trade. In particular, large VLCC and ULCC tankers, which 
have the largest ballast capacities, discharge virtually no ballast in U.S. waters; this is not 
surprising, since the U.S. imports primarily crude oil. 
 
Containerships vary significantly in the likelihood that they will discharge ballast, with the 
smallest size being the most likely to discharge. Nationally, large containerships discharge at 
a rate of about two-thirds of their port arrivals. HEC expect this rate to decrease over time. 
Generally, we expect all operators to minimize the costs of BWE. Ballast discharge data for 
regions such as the Great Lakes and California, where mandatory BWM programs have been 
in effect for a number of years, demonstrate this trend.  
 
In an assessment of the role of no ballast onboard (NOBOB) vessels in the introduction of 
NIS into the Great Lakes (Johengen, et al. 2005), it was concluded that over 90 percent of the 
vessels entering the Great Lakes have  NOBOB.53 HEC also used data from California, 
                                                 
53 The cited reference confirmed earlier analyses that NOBOBs dominate Great Lakes saltwater vessel entries 
despite significant discrepancies in the details reported by Colautti et al (2003) and the U.S. USCG. In most 
cases the disagreement involved a Colautti et al. designation of NOBOB vs. a USCG designation of ballast on 
board . St. Lawrence Seaway data for the 2000 season indicate that 89 percent of the vessels entered as 
NOBOBs. The cited reference included further analysis of the Seaway data that revealed that only ~7 percent of 
the vessels entering that year would have legally been subject to the deep-water ballast exchange and salinity

135 
where BWM has been mandatory since 2000, to corroborate the behavior observed in the 
NBIC data. This data shows that implementation of the mandatory BWM program for 
vessels54 arriving at California ports (CSLC 2005) reduces the amount of ballast water 
discharged. Additionally, note that for containerships the no-discharge ratio has increased 
from about two-thirds to over 80 percent. Panamax and Post-Panamax vessels dominate 
containership traffic in California.  
 
HEC’s experience in developing BWE exchange plans for industry and their personal 
communications with vessel operators supported these behavior patterns. 
 
These data support the findings of this RA that the actual amount of ballast discharged, and 
thus requiring management, is significantly lower than the assumptions used in the upper 
bound evaluation made in the previous BWM RA (USCG 2004). 
 
The NBIC data also provide information on how the ballast water is managed. Table B-4 
presents the ratio of ballast water managed using ER and FT, as well as using alternative 
methods (discussed above). ER is the dominant process for most vessel types. Bulk carriers 
and passenger ships extensively use FT.  
                                                                                                                                                       
verification requirements in effect at that time, the remainder having entered the system as NOBOBs, but 
ballasted at freshwater ports between Quebec City and Montreal, and were thus counted as in a ballasted 
condition by the Seaway. Such vessels would have been counted as being in a ballasted condition, but 
compliant with entry regulations, by the U.S. USCG. These numbers lead the authors to conclude that the best 
estimate is that over 90 percent of the vessels entering the Great Lakes do so as NOBOBs.

Annual Ballast Water Exchange Costs 
 
The BWE exchange costs were calculated based on the percentage ballast water managed 
through ER or FT55 and by the current discharged amount of non-coastwise vessels operating 
in the U.S. waters in 2007. In order to calculate the amount of managed ballast water, HEC 
assumed that all ballast water will be exchanged on every voyage to a U.S. port from outside 
the U.S. EEZ. Most operators will likely exchange only the tanks they need before entering 
port depending on the cargo operations they intend to perform once in the United States. 
They also assigned a uniform annual maintenance cost to every vessel that made at least one 
transit outside the EEZ; for many vessels that only make one port call in the United States 
from outside the EEZ, this would overstate the annual cost to this vessel.  HEC believe, 
however, that even though they could be overestimating the annual cost of the final rule, their 
costs certainly represents the magnitude of the expenditure they would expect to see.  The 
estimated a total annual cost for BWE to be $5 million for year 2007.

Appendix C  Ballast Water Treatment Costs for the Foreign 
Vessels 
 
This appendix presents the information on the ballast water treatment costs for the foreign 
vessels that operate in U.S. waters. The data sources for the information below are described 
on chapters 2 and 3 of the main document.  
 
Installation Costs of Ballast Water Treatments Systems 
 
In order to calculate the installation costs for the foreign vessel, HEC assumed that these 
vessels will have a wide range of options of BWTS vendors and therefore, the installation 
costs will be potentially lower than the costs incurred by the U.S. vessels. Tables C-1 
provides the average ballast pumping capacities for each category of vessel and the costs for 
the systems of the indicated capacities for the foreign fleet. Installed costs vary, depending on 
the technology utilized and the cost of the equipment to implement that process. However, 
variations in cost are also related to a process’s development stage

The foreign fleet will be subjected to the same phase-in schedule as the U.S. fleet (Table 1.1). 
In the year 2014, vessels built before 2012 with ballast capacities between 1,500 and 5,000 
cubic meters will be required to meet the discharge standards under the rulemaking phase-in 
structure. While industry practice is to delay additional costs as long as possible, a certain 
proportion of the fleet will undergo these installations during routine shipyard visits for other 
regularly scheduled maintenance. For the vessels that will comply with this rulemaking by 
2014, we have assumed that 30 percent will install BWTS each year, in the first two years 
(2012 and 2013) and 40 percent in the last year of the compliance requirement (2014). In 
2016, the remainder of the fleet built before 2012 and certain new buildings will be required 
to meet the BWDS. In this case, we have assumed that 20 percent of the population will 
install the system each year (from 2012 to 2016).  Given these assumptions and the projected

Operating Costs of Ballast Water Treatment System 
BWTS operational costs are in addition to the capital costs for installation. In order to obtain a 
cost of operation for the foreign vessel, we first had to calculate the amount of ballast discharge 
per vessel type (Table C-5).

The average amount of ballast water discharged per vessel type is calculated by using data 
collected by NBIC for year 2007. The amounts of discharge from vessels, represented in the 
above table, are of those vessels that reported actual discharge of ballast in year 2007. This data

was then cross-referenced to population data gathered from USCG MISLE database in order to 
match vessel activity with there corresponding category by vessel type. 
 
Once the average yearly amount of ballast discharge was determined, we multiplied these 
estimates by the number of vessels undergoing installation in Table C.3. Then multiply this 
product by the cost presented in Table  using the lowest cost per cubic meter of water for each 
particular vessel type.  The calculated value is then used to formulate an annual operating cost 
for BWT (Table C-5) per vessel type. 
 
Table C-6 displays the operating costs for all affected vessels in the population.  The total 
operating costs covering the period of analysis is approximately $85.5 million with discounted 
costs of approximately $71 and $56 million at 3 and 7 percent discount rates, respectively.

Appendix E Derivation of Estimates of Costs and Damages Due 
to Aquatic NIS 
 
Non-indigenous aquatic invasive species can cause considerable economic damages such as 
costs to control the invasion, damage to infrastructure and other assets, loss of fishery resources, 
and loss of recreation and tourism opportunities.  We have reviewed the literature on economic 
damages resulting from existing NIS invasions to predict damages from future invasions.  Since 
each invasive specie is unique, the type and level of cost varies widely from specie to specie (i.e., 
variability). Further, the cost estimates of damage for an individual specie can also vary as 
different studies focus on particular aspects of costs or costs within a specific geographic range 
(i.e., uncertainty).  Because of variability in the amount of damage across species and the 
uncertainty in estimating damages for an individual species, we have not attempted to derive a 
comprehensive estimate of costs per non-invasive species.  Instead, we establish a range of 
values to use – a low end of the range and upper end estimate with a calculated mid-range by 
species groups – invertebrates (mollusks), fish, and aquatic plants.  
 
Table E-1 summarizes estimates of costs due to NIS invasions as derived from the existing 
literature.  The following discussion provides an explanation for the derivation of the low and 
upper end estimates by species group. 
 
Invertebrates 
 
• At the upper end, Piementel, et al. 2005 estimates costs resulting from Zebra Mussels of 
$1 billion per year.  The estimate would be $1,093,000,000 annually updated to 2008 
price level.  This value is meant to be a comprehensive estimate covering all damages and 
control costs in all geographic areas.  In addition, Pimentel, et al 2005 reports an estimate 
for the Asian Clam at $1 billion per year in damages and costs, based on the reported cost 
in the 1993 OTA report.  The estimate would be $1,093,000,000 annually updated to 
2008 price level.  Based on the damage estimates for these two species of mollusks 
(Zebra Mussel and Asian Clam), we establish the upper end of the range at $1.093 billion 
per year in potential costs and damages for invertebrates. 
 
• At the lower end, two survey-based studies collected information on the amount that 
facilities (mainly electric generation and water treatment facilities) have spent on zebra 
mussel control and/or prevention.  A 2007 study (Connelly, et al) provided in estimate of 
$17.8 million per year spent by electric generation and water treatment facilities over the 
time period of 1989 to 2004 ($20.121 million updated to 2008).  O’Neill 1997 provided 
an estimate of $17.751 million per year for infrastructure owners and operators ($24.87 
million updated to 2008).  Both of these studies, while based on survey responses, only 
account for a subset of impacted parties and only one category of costs, but can be used 
to establish the lower end of the range of potential costs from invertebrates.  
 
• The calculated mid-range between the upper end ($1.093 billion) and lower end ($20.121 
million) is $555.0605 million.

148 
 
Fish 
 
• At the upper end, Leigh 1998 estimates that the annual commercial and recreational 
fishing benefits lost due to the ruffe invasion in the Great Lakes range from $24 million 
and $119 million to $240 million (1998 prices), $31.4 million, $155.9 million and $314.4 
million updated (based on varying assumptions about the loss of yellow perch and 
walleye populations).  We use the upper estimate of $314.4 million per year to represent 
potential damages for invasive fish species. 
 
• At the lower end, Jenkins 2001 reports an estimate of the economic impact of sea 
lamprey at $13.5 million, updated to $16.3 million. 
 
• The calculated mid-range between the upper end ($314.4 million) and lower end ($16.3 
million) is $165.3675 million.  
 
Aquatic Plants 
 
• At the upper end, Pimentel 2005 estimates that the costs to control Eurasion milfoil is 
$400 million per year ($437.2 million updated) based on an average cost per hectacre. 
 
• At the lower end, Rockwell 2003 reported estimates of costs to control Water Hyacinth in 
Louisiana of $4.0 million per year, updated to $4.642 million. 
 
• The calculated mid-range between the upper end ($437.3 million and lower end ($4.642 
million) is $220.921 million.
