1 Executive Summary 
Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 12866 US-VISIT has prepared a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
of the proposed rulemaking.   
The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator and Technology (US-VISIT) Program 
addresses the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mission by supporting accurate risk 
and eligibility decisions about individuals through a range of biometric and biographic identity 
services, as well as providing new biometric-based capabilities that support the mission of 
operational agencies.   
In order to build on the identity management services used to determine which aliens may be 
allowed to enter the U.S., US-VISIT will deploy a biometric exit system. DHS has preliminarily 
determined that the proposed Air/Sea Biometric Exit (Exit) system will verify in a reliable and 
timely manner whether those people who entered the U.S. legally have departed, and will be a 
significant improvement on the information currently available through the paper-based Form I-
94 process.  This new capability will provide much needed information for decision makers 
within the immigration and border management enterprise.   
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) document identifies and estimates the stream of costs and 
benefits of the assessed alternatives that will inform policy makers of the relative worthiness of the 
current Exit alternatives. Its objective is to serve as one key decision criteria in evaluating and 
selecting among alternatives for inclusion in the proposed Exit rule. 
1.1 Required Capabilities of Air/Sea Exit 
The Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project requires commitment and participation from two key 
organizations – namely, the air and sea carriers and the Department of Homeland Security 
including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US-VISIT.  Together, these organizations 
will provide the following capabilities to support Air/Sea Biometric Exit:   
• Capture biographic and biometric data from the alien traveler at exit from the U.S. 
• Screen against the biographic Watch Lists 
• Screen against the biometric Watch List 
• Biometrically verify identity  
• Match the alien traveler’s exit record with the traveler’s entry record 
 
In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), DHS has proposed that the first of these 
capabilities is the responsibility of the air and sea carriers, and that the second is the 
responsibility of CBP.  DHS has also proposed that the US-VISIT program has responsibility for 
providing the remaining capabilities.  The focus of this RIA is on the incremental capabilities to 
be implemented under the guidance of US-VISIT.

1.1.1 Alien Populations 
The initial and current scope of the impacted traveler population is foreign nationals who have 
gained admission to the U.S. and are required to depart according to the terms of their admission. 
This includes travelers who have entered the U.S. with the following: 
• Nonimmigrant visa (with some exceptions) 1 
• B–1 / B–2 Visa 
• Border Crossing Card (Form DSP 150) 
• Admission under the terms of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) 
1.2 Alternatives Being Evaluated 
There are five alternatives being evaluated for the RIA of Air/Sea Exit.  Alternatives vary by the 
location of the biometric collection and the entity which pays for and operates the system: 
Proposed Rule:  At a Location at the Carrier’s Discretion – Airline/Sea Carrier is 
responsible for implementation and management.  An airline representative collects 
biometric data of the aliens at a location at any in-scope airport selected at the discretion of 
the airline based on the airport terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or 
operational efficiency.  Possible locations for collection include, but do not consist solely of, 
the locations listed in the alternative solutions.  For this option, DHS assumes the most 
efficient compliance method for Sea carriers is to collect biometric data of in-scope aliens at 
the check-in counter. 
Alternative 1:  At the Check-in Counter – Airline/Sea Carrier is responsible for 
implementation and management.  An airline/sea carrier representative collects biometric 
data of the alien traveler at the airline or sea carrier check-in counter.  
Alternative 2:  At Security Check-Point – U.S. Government is responsible for 
implementation and management.  A U.S. Government representative collects biometric data 
of the alien traveler at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security checkpoint. 
This is not applicable to sea carrier passengers as there are no TSA checkpoints at seaports. 
Alternative 3:  At a Location at the Carrier’s Discretion – U.S. Government pays for 
implementation and management.  An airline representative collects biometric data of the 
aliens at a location at any in-scope airport selected at the discretion of the airline based on 
airport terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational efficiency.  
Possible locations for collection include, but do not consist solely of, the locations listed in 
the alternative solutions.  Sea carriers will collect biometric data of in-scope aliens at the 
                                               
1 For a full explanation of in-scope populations, exempt categories, procedures for individual exemption, and 
potential in-scope populations see 8 CFR 215.8(a) (2).

check-in counter. A U.S. government representative supervises the collection of the 
biometric data for both air and sea carriers. 
Alternative 4:  At a Kiosk – U.S. Government pays for implementation and 
management.  An alien passenger will be instructed by the carrier to proceed to a US-VIST 
exit kiosk at the time of their departure. The carrier will be required to notate on the boarding 
pass (whether paper or electronic) that the person must provide biometrics before departure. 
The kiosk will be available before or after the security checkpoint. The carrier is subject to 
penalty for boarding an alien passenger who has not complied with exit requirements. A 
cruise line passenger provides biometrics at the time of check-in. 
1.3 Summary of Results 
The primary purpose of this Proposed Rule is to place DHS in a better position to reliably track 
foreign visitors to the U.S. by collecting finger scans of alien travelers departing the U.S. by air and 
sea.  With such information, DHS can be more certain that an individual did, in fact, depart the 
U.S., and will be better able to match the record of his or her exit to his or her entry record.  This 
information aids decision makers within the immigration and border management enterprise and 
supports the mission of numerous operational agencies.     
The alternative assessment within this RIA consists of capital costs, operating, maintenance and 
implementation costs, disruption and delay costs, and various security and operational benefits 
categories.  For each alternative total costs to society are estimated.  In addition, costs to carriers by 
size are estimated.  All costs and monetized benefits are also presented in present value using both 
7% and 3% discount rates.  The final results are presented in Table 1-1. 
Table 1-1 reports that expenditure and delay costs for the proposed rule over a ten-year period are 
estimated at $3.5 billion.  The discounted estimate is about $2.6 billion using a discount rate of 
7% and $3.1 billion when using a discount rate of 3%.  The table also shows that the ten-year 
benefits are estimated at $1.1 billion, which are about $772 million with a discount rate of 7% 
and $936 million with a discount rate of 3%.

The RIA incorporates an uncertainty analysis to estimate a range of costs to carriers resulting from 
the Rule.  There are several sources of uncertainty inherent in the implementation of Air/Sea Exit.  
The first of which is the initial and ongoing costs of implementation, which are difficult to 
accurately quantify prior to actual implementation.  Cost uncertainty ranges are discussed in 
Section 4.1.2 and are displayed in detail in Table 4-1.  Secondly, there are various variables used to 
quantify benefits that have uncertainty ranges.  These are discussed in Chapter 5 and listed in detail 
in Appendix B. 
Table 1-2 provides a summary of the costs of the Proposed Rule to applicable entities: large and 
medium air carriers and sea carriers with international departures.  Large air carriers are defined as 
those air carriers with more than 16,000 employees.  Medium air carriers are carriers with more 
than 1,500, but less than 16,000 employees.  Sea carriers are defined as the nine sea carriers that 
have international departures.  Small air carriers, carriers with less than 1,500 employees, are 
expected to be exempt from the Proposed Rule.  For the high end of the range, we estimate that 
first year costs will be $379.2 million with an average annual recurring cost of $443.6 million.  
This would result in a 10 year present value total of $3,685.1 million at a 3 percent discount rate 
and $3,116.5 million at a 7 percent discount rate.  For the low end of the range, we estimate that 
first year costs will be $223.0 million with an average annual recurring cost of $206.1 million.  
This would result in a 10 year present value of $1,855.6 million at a 3 percent discount rate and 
$1,594.1 million at a 7 percent discount rate.

We assess seven categories of economic impacts other than direct expenditures.  Of these two are 
economic costs and five are benefits, which includes costs that could be avoided, for each 
alternative:  
1. Improved detection of aliens overstaying visas 
2. Cost avoidance resulting from improved Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
efficiency attempting apprehension of overstays 
3. Improved efficiency of processing Exit/Entry data 
4. Improved compliance with the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) 
requirements  
5. Improved national security environment 
6. Costs resulting from increased traveler queue and processing time 
7. Costs resulting from increased flight delays

The benefits are measured either quantitatively or qualitatively.  For a more detailed assessment of 
the benefits, see Section 5.32.   
1.4 Accounting Statement  
As required by OMB Circular A–4, DHS has prepared an accounting statement indicating the 
classification of the expenditures associated with this rule.  The table provides our best estimate of 
the dollar amount of these costs and benefits, expressed in 2008 dollars, at three percent and seven 
percent discount rates. We estimate that the cost of this rule will be approximately $366.9 million 
annualized (7 percent discount rate) and approximately $369.9 million annualized (3 percent 
discount rate). Quantified benefits are $47.1 million annualized (7 percent discount rate) and 
$48.8 million annualized (3 percent discount rate). The non-quantified benefits are enhanced 
security and the enabling of the expansion of the Visa Waiver Program.

1.5 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
Impacts to Small Businesses 
The Proposed Rule, as well as the alternatives, includes an exemption for small carriers.  DHS 
believes that due to this exemption the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. With the exemption of small carriers, DHS believes Air/Sea 
                                               
2 Note that some negative economic impacts, such as an increase in air and sea carrier processing time have been 
addressed as direct costs, i.e., the financial value of additional resources needed to staff any new operational processes. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA

Biometric Exit will be deployed at 73 International Airports only.  DHS also believes that none of 
these airports are owned by small jurisdictions.  DHS requests public comments on these 
assumptions.   
1.6 Comments 
There is a lack of data concerning several of the variables used in this analysis.  Therefore, we have 
had to make assumptions and calculate estimates in an environment of uncertainty and variance in 
industry and government operations.  The key assumptions that drive the cost and benefit analyses 
are described in detail in the regulatory impact assessment, and are summarized in Appendices A 
and B. We solicit any comments to improve the analysis to the greatest extent possible. Comments 
may be submitted to the regulatory docket using any of the methods listed under ADDRESSES in 
the preamble to this Proposed Rule.  All input received during the public comment period will be 
considered.

The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program records 
the arrival and departure of alien travelers;3 conducts certain terrorist, criminal, and immigration 
violation checks on alien individuals; and compares biometric identifiers to those collected on 
previous encounters to verify identity.  US-VISIT is being implemented in phases, which began 
with an entry program and a pilot exit program.   
US-VISIT integrates the immigration information collected into a combined picture of an 
individual.  As a result, more complete and timely information is available for appropriate 
decision-makers, such as consular officers overseas, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers 
at the ports of entry, United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) adjudicators, 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the interior of the U.S., and United States 
Coast Guard (USCG) officers offshore. 
The next significant deployment to further the US-VISIT Program is this proposed rule, which 
when implemented will provide the capability to collect finger scans of alien travelers departing 
the U.S. by air and sea.  With such information, DHS can better track departures from the U.S. and 
will be better able to match entry and exit records.  This Air/Sea Biometric Exit system will verify 
in a reliable and timely manner whether those people who entered the U.S. have departed via air 
or sea.   
Under this Proposed Rule, DHS intends to require that airlines and sea carriers collect biometric 
finger scan data from alien passengers and transmit that data to DHS within 24 hours of departure.  
Collection of biometrics must take place on-site at the airport or sea-port, respectively, but 
location of deployment is otherwise left to the discretion of the carrier.  This Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (RIA) examines the costs and benefits of this proposed requirement and four regulatory 
alternatives.   
This Proposed Rulemaking is considered to be an economically significant regulatory action under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order (EO) 12866 because it may result in the expenditure of over 
$100 million in any one year.  DHS is thus required to conduct an in-depth evaluation that 
considers the costs and benefits of the proposed regulatory action as well as a host of alternatives.  
Accordingly, this analysis has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
2.1 Purpose and Need 
The ability to biometrically record exit would enable the Government to more effectively identify 
and track individuals through a range of biometric and biographic identity services. This capability 
would also more fully meet the protective purpose of the statutory requirements of the Enhanced 
                                               
3 Details regarding aliens who are subject to US-VISIT biometric requirements are provided in Section 3.2.

Border Security Act in addition to supporting the mission of numerous operational agencies by 
providing much needed information to immigration and border management decision-makers.   
The key outcome sought in proposing this rule is to place DHS in a better position to reliably track 
foreign visitors leaving the U.S. by collecting finger scans of alien travelers departing the U.S. by 
air and sea.  With such information, DHS can be more certain that an individual did, in fact, 
depart the U.S., and will be better able to match the record of his or her exit to his or her entry 
record.   
DHS believes that for large air and sea carriers the Proposed Rule provides reliable collection of 
biometric information while allowing the most flexibility to the air and sea carrier industry and 
causing the least disruption to the traveling public.  Alien travelers subject to US-VISIT may be 
processed at distinct nodes in the air and sea travel departure process (i.e., at the check-in counter, 
at the departure gate) and concurrently with existing travel processes (i.e., checking in, showing 
identification, checking luggage, receiving boarding pass, submitting boarding pass) outside of 
the security checkpoint process.  It is also the regulatory option that DHS believes provides the 
greatest amount of flexibility to alien travelers and carriers with prior domestic connections while 
imposing the least amount of burden on existing government processes (security screening).  DHS 
recognizes, however, that small international air and sea carriers will not find implementing the 
Proposed Rule feasible at this time. 
Although this RIA attempts to mirror the terms and wording of the proposed regulation, no 
attempt is made to precisely replicate the regulatory language and readers are cautioned that the 
actual regulatory text, not the text of this evaluation, is binding. 
2.2 Document Purpose  
Pursuant to EO 12866, US-VISIT has prepared an RIA of the Proposed Rulemaking.  This RIA 
provides an estimate of the future benefits and costs of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit alternatives 
considered for full deployment as part of the Comprehensive Exit Program. The assessment of 
benefits and costs that a RIA provides allows DHS decision makers to consider the impacts of a 
major investment like Air/Sea Biometric Exit before selecting an implementation alternative. OMB 
Circulars A-4, A-11, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 require that as part of credible and 
defensible regulatory actions, capital planning exercises, and investment control process, an 
agency must perform an investment analysis providing estimates of benefits and costs prior to 
selecting an alternative.  
An RIA meets this requirement by providing a benefit-cost analysis, which OMB Circular A-4 
describes is a primary tool used for regulatory analysis.  Where all benefits and costs can be 
quantified and expressed in monetary units, benefit-cost analysis provides decision makers with a 
clear indication of the most efficient alternative, that is, the alternative that generates the largest 
net benefits to society (ignoring distributional effects). Along with other analyses of impacts, such 
as the required privacy and environmental impact analyses and impacts to small entities, the 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit RIA will provide DHS executives with a valuable input into the decision 
making process.

The objectives of this report are to: 
• Provide an impartial analysis of alternatives that have been developed by business and 
information technology stakeholders to achieve Air/Sea Biometric Exit objectives; 
• Provide credible analysis to inform, guide and allow for subsequent program planning and 
design activities, including follow-on Regulatory Analysis work; 
• Better inform policy selection decisions; and 
• Provide justification and support to the business case for funding and investments for future 
fiscal years.  
2.3 Comments 
There is a lack of data concerning several of the variables used in this analysis.  Therefore, we had 
to make assumptions and calculate estimates in an environment of uncertainty and variance in 
industry and government operations.  The key assumptions that drive the cost and benefit analyses 
are described in detail in the following chapters, and are summarized in Appendices A and B. We 
solicit any comments to improve the analysis to the greatest extent possible. Comments may be 
submitted to the regulatory docket using any of the methods listed under ADDRESSES in the 
preamble to this Proposed Rule.  All input received during the public comment period will be 
considered.

2.4 Air/Sea Exit Background 
The U.S. Government, through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), must provide for the 
security for our citizens and visitors, facilitate legitimate travel and trade, ensure the integrity of 
our immigration system, while protecting the privacy of our citizens and visitors. To do so, 
decision makers involved in immigration and border management must accurately and 
consistently distinguish those few individuals who represent a potential threat from the millions of 
legitimate individuals interacting with the U.S. Government every year. Key to this distinction is 
the capability to provide decision makers, in a timely manner, with the necessary information 
about an individual to make the right decision. 
2.5 RIA Air/Sea Exit Stakeholders 
Multiple stakeholders have a vested interest in the Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project and potentially 
will be impacted by it.  Among them are federal departments and agencies involved with law 
enforcement, intelligence services, and national security, as well as non-criminal justice agencies 
authorized by statute to access DHS collected and shared data, state and local law enforcement 
organizations, Congress, international partners, air and sea carriers, alien travelers, out-of-scope 
travelers and the airline and cruise industries. 
It is anticipated that the Project will have an operational impact on private entities, including air 
and sea carriers, DHS, and other U.S. Government agencies. Federal agencies involved in 
immigration and border management will benefit from Air/Sea Biometric Exit by having the 
ability to query and generate reports from the US-VISIT databases of entry and exit information.  
Key immigration and border management stakeholders who are involved in this effort are the 
following: 
• DHS 
• Department of State (DOS)

2.5.1 Stakeholder Impacts 
Air and Sea Carriers 
Under the Proposed rule, air and sea carriers will take on additional responsibilities to prepare 
for the Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project and operate as part of the enhanced exit process.  Among 
these responsibilities are the following: 
• Develop and implement new departure procedures for alien travelers for each port from 
which the carrier operates departures to international destinations 
• Educate alien travelers on the departure procedures 
• Acquire fingerprint scanners that are in accordance with DHS interface standards 
• Develop a strategy for capturing fingerprints for alien travelers who are connecting to the 
carrier’s international departure flights 
• Install or develop solutions for fingerprint scanners at various locations of each airport or 
seaport where the carrier conducts international departures, which may include locations 
at or near the check in counter, or closer to the departure gate, in accordance with the air 
carrier’s strategy for connecting travelers 
• Train personnel to be able to identify which travelers are aliens subject to US-VISIT, obtain 
quality fingerprints, and use and maintain the fingerprint scanners 
• Develop software to gather the required biometric data and associated Carrier Unique 
Identifiers and transmit to the Exit system within 24 hours of an international departure’s 
departure time (the “out” time of a flight’s Out-Off-On-In (OOOI) times) 
• Develop procedures to purge fingerprints after receiving from DHS acknowledgement of 
fingerprint receipt 
• Prepare for DHS Security-related and Privacy-related audits of fingerprint scanners, storage 
and purge procedures, and data transmission procedures 
• Develop procedures and conduct internal auditing to ensure it has collected the required 
biometric data from each alien traveler 
• Respond to reports of DHS-conducted analyses of quality of fingerprints received from the 
carrier 
DHS 
• The Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) will have as many as 
20,000,000 alien travelers4 added to its database every year with a resulting impact upon 
data storage requirements.  As a result, the IDENT system will be required to process 
approximately 52,000,000 more transactions5 annually, roughly doubling the number of 
transactions being completed currently.  Additional automated machines, called matchers,

2000 (Public Law 106-215) and the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act (Public Law 106-396), page 6, May 2007. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA

will be required to process the incoming scans. More fingerprint examiners may be 
needed to attempt to match any poor quality exit scans with the corresponding entry scan 
and verify biometric watch list hits.  Associated transaction volume may also impact 
server capacity and efficiency, data memory storage and data center footprint. (See also 
Appendix A, Section A.1.3.2, Impact to IDENT.) 
• CBP’s data center will be affected to the extent that Air/Sea Biometric Exit uses the 
existing Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS) network.  If there were full 
compliance and all aliens were required to provide biometric data on exit, approximately 
52,000,000 transactions yearly would be added to the traffic already flowing through the 
APIS network.  
• Overstays identified as a result of Air/Sea Biometric Exit matching are likely to be the 
subject of lookouts subsequently created in Treasury Enforcement Communications 
System (TECS).  In addition to the data storage impact of those additional records, as 
these confirmed overstays are encountered during subsequent applications for admission, 
CBP officers will be required to determine admissibility in light of the previous overstay 
and make disposition of every alien who is refused admission. 
• Some aliens who are refused admission based on a confirmed overstay can be expected to 
attempt to seek entry without inspection.  This could have an impact on the Border Patrol, 
ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), the Immigration Court, and 
other related organizations. 
• Exit records may identify passengers who have not been reported to CBP via APIS.  If 
DHS determines to fine the carrier who failed to transmit an APIS record, the workload 
of the National Fines Office will increase. 
• CBP may be impacted due to increased record watches as the result of mismatches on 
exit data during the identity verification process.  For example, if a traveler provides 
fingerprints that do not match those on file, that traveler may be flagged for additional 
screening at their next entry, thus increasing CBP workload.   
• ICE will benefit from an increased rate of the matching of entry and exit records.  
However, this benefit may be offset by the increase in the number of suspected overstays 
identified based upon the lack of a departure record.  (The manifest data will still be 
provided, but there may be some number of records removed if there is a mismatch 
between the traveler's name and the biometric provided.)   This will impact the DRO and 
Immigration Courts.   
DOS 
• The VWP requires the termination of any country whose violation rate (for example, 
overstays) exceeds a certain threshold.  Removal of a country from participation could 
have an impact on visa application volumes and U.S. foreign relations. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA

• All visas issued are automatically void following the period of authorized admission, if 
the holder of the visa has not departed the United States.6  The DOS will need to receive 
notice of these overstays in order to evaluate potential action. 
2.6 Air/Sea Exit Gap Analysis 
This Section summarizes the Gap Analysis undertaken for the Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project.  The 
detailed Gap Analysis can be found in Appendix E. 
The Gap Analysis helps support the justification to undertake the Air/Sea Biometric Exit initiative 
by assessing the state of the current exit environment, describing a desired future exit 
environment, and identifying gaps in operational performance between the current and future 
environments.  It allows the Integrated Product Team (IPT) to determine the scope and magnitude 
of the organizational, technological, and procedural changes required to implement the future 
environment.  A gap analysis also builds the foundation for an RIA by developing the performance 
metrics that will measure success in closing gaps identified in the analysis.  The performance 
metrics will be used in the estimation of benefits.  Closing performance gaps also requires actions 
which, in turn, result in costs.  Thus, the gap analysis also provides the foundation for estimation 
of costs. 
 
The following figure illustrates the approach for the Gap Analysis.

Figure 2-1. Gap Analysis Approach 
 
The following section provides a summary of the current state, future state and the gaps identified, 
along with a description of how the future state will either eliminate or mitigate those gaps.  
 
2.6.1 Current State 
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires carriers to provide DHS with passenger and 
crew manifests for ships and vessels arriving from or departing to foreign ports in other than 
contiguous territory. When departing the U.S. by air or sea, the carrier examines the in-scope 
traveler’s passport or other documentation (such as an alien registration card) and collects such 
biographic data as last name, first name, middle initial, date of birth, and citizenship.  This 
information may be collected by passing the document’s machine readable zone (MRZ) through 
an automated reader or by the carrier personnel typing the information for transmission to DHS, 
or by the traveler entering the data for check-in over the internet.  The biographic data are sent to 
CBP’s Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) via the Advance Passenger 
Information System (APIS) data interchange system. Today CBP does not send any information 
back to the carrier to indicate further carrier action.7  If the carrier does not collect the biographic 
information at the check-in counter (because, for example, the passenger has printed out the 
boarding pass at home and has no luggage to check in), then the carrier will verify this 
information at the departure gate.   
By regulation, Form I-94 has been designated as the arrival/departure document for certain 
nonimmigrant aliens.  Upon arrival in the U.S. by air or sea, these passengers must present a 
completed Form I-94 at time of inspection.  For nonimmigrants arriving via the land borders, 
required I-94s are prepared at the POE after passing through primary inspection lanes.  In both 
cases, the CBP officer endorses both the arrival and the departure sections of the Form I-94 with 
the date, place, category of admission, and authorized length of stay.  The officer then returns the 
departure portion to the traveler.  The arrival portions are forwarded for data entry and eventual 
uploading to TECS. 
Carriers are required to collect the departure I-94s for passengers departing the U.S. by air or sea 
and forward the forms to the DHS office at the POE.  Nonimmigrants departing the U.S. via the 
Canadian or Mexican land borders are requested to return the departure I-94s to the U.S. or 
Canadian inspectors at departure.  Those collected by the Canadian officials are returned to the 
DHS office at the POE.  DHS forwards all the forms for input into TECS and ADIS in the same 
                                               
7 This will change by February 2008, with the implementation of the Advance Passenger Information System 
rulemaking in the air environment.  After TECS has received the biographic data and conducted a biographic watch list 
checking, it will return data to the carrier’s system indicating carrier action – for example, whether to issue a boarding 
pass or not, or to identify the passenger as selectee status.   See 19 CFR 122.49a and 122.75a; 72 FR 48320. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  16
manner as the arrival forms.  Arrival and departure information are matched through the unique 
admission number which appears on both the arrival and departure sections of the Form I-94. 
Not all persons departing the U.S. leave through CBP-staffed POEs.  International flights routinely 
depart the U.S. at small and medium sized airports that do not service international arrivals.  
Persons may depart the U.S. by land on roads that are not adjacent to a CBP-staffed POE.  At some 
locations, traffic enters the U.S. on a one-way street and departs from the U.S. at a location 
separated from the POE by the distance of a block or more.  At a few locations, persons leave the 
U.S. by train; others leave by small pleasure boats.  Although Canadian officials collect and return 
I-94s to DHS on the northern land border, there are no corresponding official collection 
procedures on the southern land border.  In these cases, the departure from the U.S. is recorded 
only if the nonimmigrant affirmatively seeks to return the departure I-94 form to DHS. 
2.6.2 Future Exit Environment 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit involves the coordinated efforts of three key organizations:  air/sea 
carriers, CBP, and US-VISIT.  US-VISIT processing will all be back-end.   Because the carriers 
are required to provide biometric data from the in-scope traveler within 24 hours of aircraft or 
vessel departure, the data will not be used to intercept or otherwise influence the flow of the in-
scope traveler within the airport or seaport at the time of departure.   
This section provides a description of processes to be implemented as part of Air/Sea Biometric 
Exit.  While the focus is on US-VISIT, to provide context this section describes, at a high level, the 
processing expected of the air and sea carriers and CBP.  In the paragraphs of this section, a brief 
description of the each major process is provided.  Of the five processes identified, the last three 
are specifically US-VISIT processes.  A process flow chart below shows the logical order of steps to 
complete a thread.   
2.6.2.1 Air/Sea Carrier Process 
All commercial air and sea carriers operating passenger aircraft or vessels that depart the U.S. will 
develop and deploy operational processes and solutions that capture data required by DHS to 
enable the activities described herein.  
 
2.6.2.2 CBP Process 
CBP automation systems are already in place in most commercial airports and seaports for CBP’s 
needs.  Specific CBP Air/Sea Biometric Exit process steps include searching for biometric 
identifiers (for example, a FIN) that match the biographic data collected for the traveler and 
transmission of required biometric information to US-VISIT. 
 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  17
2.6.2.3 Biometric Watch List Search 
The Air/Sea Biometric Exit solution will search the biometric Watch List for each in-scope traveler.  
 
2.6.2.4 Identity Verification 
The Air/Sea Biometric Exit process includes verifying the identify of the in-scope traveler by 
determining whether they have been encountered by US-VISIT before – for example, by providing 
fingerprints during the Entry or Pre-Travel (visa application) processes. 
 
2.6.2.5 Entry/Exit Matching 
US-VISIT maintains a record of each entry to and exit from the U.S. by an in-scope traveler.  
Air/Sea Biometric Exit matches entry and exit transactions so that various analyses can be 
conducted and reports generated, such as determining which in-scope travelers may have 
overstayed the terms of their entry. 
A high-level process flow diagram for Air/Sea Biometric Exit is shown in Figure 2-2 below.  In 
this diagram, process boxes are colored gold if the process is not conducted in real time, meaning 
that passenger flow is not dependent on process completion.

2.6.3 Gaps Identified  
A discussion of the gaps between the current air/sea exit environment and the desired future exit 
environment is provided below:   
 
1.  Ability to determine whether an in-scope traveler has left the country 
Gap:  In the current environment, because of the many manual steps and length of time 
to enter the I-94 data into the entry-exit system, the likelihood is high that not all 
departures of in-scope travelers are recorded in the Air/Sea environment.  
Furthermore, there is a lag in time between the departure of the traveler and the 
record of his or her exit from the country 
To-Be: Biometric data (fingerprints) of an in-scope traveler will be collected as a condition 
of being able to board the aircraft or vessel.  Air/Sea Biometric Exit will 
automatically record the exit on the traveler’s entry-exit record within 24 hours of 
the alien’s departure.   
 
2.   Accurate and immediate recording of exit information 
Gap: The time-consuming manual process of entering exit data for each traveler provides 
the opportunity for incomplete and delayed recording of the exit.  Furthermore, if 
the traveler were to attempt to re-enter the U.S., the delay in recording the exit data 
might not allow the most recent exit status or notices for further screening to be 
displayed to the CBP officer. 
To-Be: The Air/Sea Biometric Exit system will automatically record the exit on the 
traveler’s entry-exit record.   
 
3.  Ability to determine which in-scope travelers have overstayed the terms of their admission  
Gap: In the current environment, because of the many manual steps and length of time 
to enter the I-94 data into the entry-exit system, the likelihood is high that not all 
departures of in-scope travelers are recorded in the Air/Sea environment.  Because 
determination of overstays is dependent today on the process of collecting and 
recording departure data from I-94 forms, the likelihood is high that not all 
overstays are identified. 
To-Be: The future entry-exit system will rely on the more accurate and timely exit 
biometric data to identify the departed travelers who overstayed the terms of their 
admittance. 
 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  20
4.  Level of confidence in the identity of an exiting traveler  
Gap: Reliance on biographic data, such as matching the name provided by the traveler to 
stored names, has inherent risk.  A simple misspelling of the name – which may 
occur, for example, during the visa issuance process – could mean the identity of 
the traveler would not be confirmed.  More importantly, individuals may wish to 
enter and/or exit the U.S. fraudulently by using false names and aliases. 
To-Be: The traveler will be identified using both biographic and biometric data.  The 
entry-exit system will determine whether the traveler has been encountered by US-
VISIT before and whether the biometric data submitted at exit matches the 
biometric data submitted at entry for the person possessing the same biographic 
data.  If the traveler has not been encountered by US-VISIT before, then the entry-
exit system will search through its entire database of fingerprints to determine 
whether the traveler may have entered the country using different biographic data. 
 
5.  Ability to obtain an accurate history of a traveler’s entry to and exit from the U.S. 
Gap: Without accurate and immediate recording of an in-scope traveler’s exit, the 
traveler’s entry-exit record is not complete.  A risk exists that the traveler will be 
admitted into the U.S. without sufficient understanding of his or her entry-exit 
history, including actions or events that may be relevant to an officer’s decision to 
admit an individual or grant other benefits. 
To-Be: The entry-exit record will still be a tool for the CBP officer.  However, in the 
future, the traveler’s exit from the U.S. will be automatically and immediately 
recorded.  The exit data will be compared to the traveler’s entry data, so that an 
overstay can be determined. 
 
6.  Ability to expedite the entrance of in-scope travelers  
Gap: When the entry-exit, identity, or watch list information on a traveler is not current 
or accurate, or if the CBP Officer does not trust the data, the CBP Officer may 
request the traveler be sent for secondary inspection more often than would 
otherwise be the case.  This delays the entrance of the specific traveler and 
potentially the admission of other travelers.   
To-Be: The process followed by the CBP Officer will not change.  However, with Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit, the information about the traveler’s entry and exit history will be 
biometrically verified and current.  After the traveler provides biometric data at 
exit, the Air/Sea Biometric Exit system will search biometric watch lists and verify 
the identity of the traveler.  If any of the checks turns up suspicious information, 
analyses will be conducted and the traveler’s record will be noted.  If the traveler 
attempts to enter the country again, the appropriate flags will be displayed to the 
CBP Officer. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  21
7.  Ability to support the evaluation of the inclusion of a country in the Visa Waiver Program 
(VWP) 
Gap: The database of entry-exit records of in-scope travelers risks being incomplete.  
Thus, calculation of a particular country’s overstay rate would be inaccurate. 
To-Be: In-scope travelers will be required to provide biometric data on exit from the U.S.  
The Air/Sea Biometric Exit system will ensure that a traveler’s exit data are 
automatically and immediately recorded within 24 hours of the traveler’s 
departure.  This will allow US-VISIT to accurately determine any given country’s 
collective overstay rate. 
 
8.  Support resource allocation decisions for law enforcement  
Gap: Resources are sometimes expended for the wrong reason: e.g., the alien has already 
left the country. 
To-Be: A law enforcement agency still will rely on the entry-exit record to make determine 
whether to expend resources to seek out the alien of interest.  However, confidence 
that the record is more complete and current is higher because the in-scope traveler 
is required to provide biometric data at exit, and the exit data are automatically 
recorded. 
 
2.7 Summary of Methodology 
The RIA provides an assessment of proposed regulation and four alternatives based on the costs, 
benefits, risks and other criteria. This Section outlines the approach taken for this quantitative and 
qualitative assessment. 
Step 1: Identify Alternatives  
This step refers to scoping alternatives, which includes major investments, populations affected 
and general implementation timeframes. Identifying the scope of each alternative provides the 
foundation to define, quantify and evaluate costs, benefits and risks.  
Step 2: Analyze Alternative Costs 
This step involved defining the capital expenditure, operations and maintenance costs for each 
alternative, through research of prior cost estimates and consultation with Government and subject 
matter experts.  
To learn more about the cost analysis methodology, assumptions and detailed costs for each 
alternative, please refer to Section 4.0, Cost Estimation and Appendix A, Cost Assumptions.

Step 3: Analyze Alternative Benefits 
Benefits analysis refers to defining and evaluating the monetized and non-monetized benefits 
associated with each alternative. To determine the extent to which each alternative contributes to 
the overall success of the enterprise, benefits for each alternative were aligned to the goals of the 
Department of Homeland Security.  For monetized benefits, conservative estimates were applied 
for the value of detection, efficiency, and other impacts. For non-monetized (qualitative) benefits, 
the value provided to the traveler or to the enterprise was captured, but no dollar amount was 
placed on the benefit. Additionally, negative economic consequences of the implementation of the 
alternatives is also considered and estimated.  These include the social cost of disruption and delay.  
To learn more about the benefits analysis methodology, assumptions and detailed benefits for each 
alternative, please refer to Section 5.0, Benefits Estimations and Appendix B, Benefit Assumptions 
and Data. 
Step 4: Perform Uncertainty Analysis 
Uncertainty, or risk, analysis involves incorporating uncertainty in the cost and benefit estimates, 
which, in turn, are reflected in the overall outcome of the analysis. This process involved 
capturing expert opinions and analyzing primary and secondary data in order to develop a 
probability distribution around certain estimates. Once the probability distributions were 
established, a Monte Carlo simulation was run to compute overall uncertainty ranges for costs and 
benefits.  To learn more about the risk analysis methodology please refer to Section 6.1.2 for a 
discussion of the outcome risk. 
Step 5: Perform Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis addresses the impact to outcomes when a single assumption is varied.  
Sensitivity analyses should be performed on key assumptions to determine the sensitivity of the 
outcome to such variables independent of all other assumptions.  Please refer to Section 6.2 for a 
discussion of the Sensitivity Analysis. 
Step 6: Perform Break-Even Analysis 
This RIA does not monetize certain important security benefits that are deemed to a rationale for 
the Air/Sea Biometric Exit program.  As a baseline of terrorist activities can not be specified, a 
specific level of prevention can not be forecasted.  This step assesses the minimum level of 
terrorism prevention necessary to return a net present value of 0 for this rule.  Please refer to 
Section 6.3 for a discussion of the Break-Even Analysis approach. 
Step 7: Report Outcomes 
This step involves reporting a set of estimated expenditures, other economic costs of disruption 
and delay, and benefits by alternative in this analysis.  For each alternative total costs to society are 
reported.  In addition, costs to carriers by size are estimated.  All costs and monetized benefits are 
also presented in present value using both 7% and 3% discount rates. For more information, 
please refer to Section 8.0, Analysis Framework.

3 Scope of Alternatives 
This report evaluates the proposed regulation and four different alternatives, varying by location of 
collection of the biometric data and whether carrier collection is managed by and paid for by the 
carriers or the U.S. Government. For detailed information regarding the alternative selection 
process and the breadth of alternatives analyzed during the selection process, refer to Appendix F. 
3.1 Summary of Selected Alternatives 
Proposed Rule:  At a Location at the Carrier’s Discretion – Airline/Sea Carrier pays for 
implementation and management.  An airline/sea carrier representative collects biometric 
data of the aliens at a location at any in-scope airport selected at the discretion of the airline 
based on airport terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational 
efficiency.  Possible locations for collection include, but do not consist solely of, the 
locations listed in the alternative solutions.  Sea carriers will collect biometric data of in-
scope aliens at the check-in counter. 
Alternative 1:  At the Check-in Counter – Airline/Sea Carrier pays for implementation and 
management.  An airline/sea carrier representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler 
at the airline or sea carrier check-in counter. 
Alternative 2:  At Security Check-Point – U.S. Government pays for implementation 
and management.  A U.S. Government representative collects biometric data of the alien 
traveler at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security checkpoint. This is not 
applicable to sea carrier passengers as there are no TSA checkpoints at seaports. 
Alternative 3:  At a Location at the Carrier’s Discretion – U.S. Government pays for 
implementation and management.  An airline representative collects biometric data of the 
aliens at a location at any in-scope airport selected at the discretion of the airline based on 
airport terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational efficiency.  
Possible locations for collection include, but do not consist solely of, the locations listed in 
the alternative solutions.  Sea carriers will collect biometric data of in-scope aliens at the 
check-in counter.  A U.S. government representative supervises the collection of the 
biometric data for both air and sea carriers. 
Alternative 4:  At a Kiosk – U.S. Government pays for implementation and 
management.  The alien passenger will be instructed by the carrier to proceed to a US-VIST 
exit kiosk at the time of their departure. The carrier will be required to notate on the boarding 
pass (whether paper or electronic) that the person must provide biometrics before departure. 
The kiosk will be available before or after the security checkpoint. The carrier is subject to 
penalty for boarding the alien who has not complied with exit requirements. A cruise line 
passenger provides biometrics at the time of check-in.

3.2 Alien Populations 
The initial and current scope of the impacted traveler population consists of foreign nationals who 
have gained admission to the U.S. and are required to depart according to the terms of their 
admission. This includes travelers who have entered the U.S. with the following: 
• Nonimmigrant visa (with some exceptions) 8 
• B–1 / B–2 Visa 
• Border Crossing Card (Form DSP 150) 
• Admission under the terms of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) 
3.3 Detailed Scope of Air/Sea Biometric Exit Alternatives 
This section presents the detailed scope of the five alternatives evaluated.  
Global Assumptions 
The following assumptions pertain to the analysis of the Proposed Rule as well as all alternatives: 
• All alternatives will allow for auditing capabilities to ensure that business, security and 
privacy requirements are met. 
• All alternatives will allow for the same quality of print collection and identity 
verification. 
• Collection will be primarily used to verify identity and confirm exit. 
• Providing biometric data will not trigger a law enforcement response at the time of exit 
under the proposed rule.  However, enforcement action may be taken when an alien 
presents for possible readmission into the U.S. or in the final destination country of the 
alien with the cooperation of local law authorities. 
• There will be no significant costs incurred to coordinate with TSA and CBP for the 
Proposed Rule and the alternatives; incremental costs have been incorporated into the 
cost estimates. 
                                               
8 For a full explanation of in-scope populations, exempt categories, procedures for individual exemption, and 
potential in-scope populations see 8 CFR 215.8(a) (2). 
 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA

• Sufficient outreach and education will be provided. 
• Benefits to enhancing the security and integrity of our immigration system are 
primarily away from the airport/seaport, in terms of identifying overstays for interior 
enforcement, and adjudicating re-entry or visa renewal. 
• All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be collected, used, disclosed, and 
retained in accordance with applicable statute, regulation, treaty, department and 
component policy. 
• Exit will not be recorded at “general aviation” airports.  It will only be recorded at 
airports that have regularly scheduled international departures. 
• Small carriers, carriers with less than 1,500 employees, will be granted an exemption 
from Exit requirements under all of the alternatives. 
• APIS has or will invest in the necessary capacity to handle additional data volume 
stemming from implementation. 
• All carriers affected by the rule will have access to APIS. 
• Entities affected by the rule will not rely on eAPIS to transmit biometrics. 
 
Solution-Specific Base Assumptions 
The following assumptions pertain to the Proposed Rule and the alternatives on a case-by-case 
basis: 
• For the Proposed Rule and Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 the entity (whether U.S. Government 
or other) that collects the biometric data purchases, owns, deploys, certifies, and 
maintains all the biometric collection equipment and software. 
• For Alternative 3, carrier personnel will collect the biometric data but the Government 
will purchase, own, deploy, certify, and maintain all the biometric collection 
equipment and software. 
• For the Proposed Rule and Alternatives 3 and 4, the solution will deploy to 73 airports, 
those airports with international flights served by carriers with more than 1,500 
employees. 
• For Alternative 1, the solution will deploy to 304 airports, those airports with a TSA 
presence that serve medium and large airports. 
• For Alternative 2, the solution will deploy to 455 airports, those airports with a TSA 
presence. 
• For the Proposed Rule and Alternative 3, the modeling assumption is that the solution 
will deploy to the gate for 80% of covered airports and to the counter for 20% of 
covered airports.

The Regulatory Analysis seeks to provide comprehensive documentation of all assumptions. We 
solicit any comments to improve upon our assumptions.  Comments may be submitted to the 
regulatory docket using any of the methods listed under ADDRESSES in the preamble to this 
Proposed Rule. 
3.3.1 Baseline 
A RIA examines selected alternatives in comparison to a baseline, consistent with OMB Circular A-
4 and DHS guidance set forth in the Department of Homeland Security Capital Planning and 
Investment Control Cost-Benefit Analysis Workbook.  
The baseline condition was reported in the gap analysis where it was referred to as “Current 
State.”  Key features of the current state include: 
• No current biometric capture at exit 
• Biographic capture through passport electronic MRZ capture or hand entry by carrier 
personnel at air and sea exits 
• Biographic capture through submission of I-94 and I-94w documents collected by carriers 
at air and sea exits 
• Biographic capture through collection of I-94 and I-94w documents collected by U.S. and 
Canadian immigration officials at some land exits 
• No biographic capture at some land exits 
• Remote matching of entries to exits through the manual comparison of entry and exit I-94 
and I-94w document portions 
3.3.2 Proposed Rule 
The Proposed Rule allows processing of alien travelers at a location of each airline’s choosing 
based on airport terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational 
efficiency. By providing this flexibility, DHS estimates that this rule permits a significant reduction 
in airport coverage from the 455 airports where TSA maintains a presence to the 73 airports with 
international flights served by carriers with more than 1,500 employees. Approximately 27% of 
air passengers (whether aliens or otherwise) connect from a purely domestic airport to an 
international airport for departure from the United States.9  Under a pure counter-based capture 
option, the connecting flight problem means that (1) aliens may have to exit the secure area and 
return to a front counter for biometrics capture and then be re-screened by TSA, or (2) all aliens 
must have biometrics captured at over 455 airports, whether domestic or international.  To reduce 
                                               
9 See Appendix B for details on estimation of proportion of travelers originating international travel with a domestic 
journey. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  30
the overall burden, the Proposed Rule reflects a critical element not present in the other counter-
based and TSA security checkpoint alternatives: the carriers would be given the flexibility to 
capture at a location at the carrier’s discretion including the capture of biometrics from those 
aliens making a first domestic leg on an international voyage. This flexible processing path offers 
greater convenience and lowers risk of missed flights for those passengers arriving on connecting 
flights, who would otherwise need to exit the sterile area for biometric processing.  
Carrier Discretion Solution – Carrier Implementation. The Carrier Discretion Solution involves 
the airlines installing the scanning devices at a location of each airline’s choosing based on airport 
terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational efficiency.  
Because of the layout of a typical seaport, DHS assumes for the purposes of this proposed rule 
analysis that the biometric collection will occur only in the check-in area. This seaport process is 
assumed to be identical for all the other alternatives and at each of the 33 seaports.  The text 
describing the Carrier Discretion Solution will refer primarily to airlines for this reason. 
Operational Impacts to the Alien, Carrier, and DHS – Operational impacts are assumed to be 
significant for the alien in terms of processing time no matter where biometrics are collected.  The 
carrier would experience operational impacts such as waiting and processing delays, which may 
result in flight delays. Operational impacts to the Government would be low, with no additional 
time or process for this alternative.  
Need for Additional Network or Connectivity – At the check-in counters, there is existing 
network and connectivity available.  Biometric collection would have to be integrated with these 
systems.  However, the Carrier Discretion Solution collected by the carrier does not offer a high 
level of IT security since the carrier must transfer the biometric information to the Government. 
Infrastructure would most likely need to be established for gate verification or any other non-
counter location. 
Privacy – Successful compliance with the Privacy, Homeland Security, and E-Government Acts and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies requires limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII 
against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention.  This includes PII collected on behalf of 
the Government for non-Governmental purposes.  The Carrier Discretion Solution with carrier 
collection has the lowest degree of privacy of all alternatives since the biometric data must be 
collected by a private company and then transferred to the Government as with all solutions 
utilizing carrier collection business processes.  
3.3.3 Counter Solution 
The Counter Solution consists of Alternative 1, in which departing alien travelers are processed 
once at air and sea exit at the check-in counter, with no further verification before departure. With 
the Counter Solution, international air travelers with a connecting domestic flight would have 
their biometrics collected at the check-in counter of the domestic carrier, which would greatly 
expand the number of in-scope airports and air carriers. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  31
Counter Solution Highlights 
Alternative 1:  At the Check-in Counter – Airline/Sea Carrier collection.  An airline/sea carrier 
representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the airline or sea carrier check-in 
counter. 
Counter Solution with airline/sea carrier collection highlights include:  
• Little to no implementation costs for U.S. Government 
• Low training costs to Government 
• Minimal impact to operational activity of traveler and Government 
Operational Impacts to the Alien, Carrier, and DHS – Operational impacts are significant for the 
alien in terms of processing time since a new information collection process would be established.  
However, as mentioned above, airlines have made it increasingly more convenient to travel 
without visiting the check-in counter. The carrier would experience operational impacts such as 
waiting and processing delays, which may result in flight delays. Operational impacts to the 
Government would be minimal. 
Need for Additional Network or Connectivity – At the check-in counters, there is existing 
network and connectivity available.  Biometric collection would have to be integrated with these 
systems.  However, the Counter Solution collected by the carrier does not offer a high level of IT 
security since the carrier must transfer the biometric information from to the Government.   
Privacy – Successful compliance with the Privacy, Homeland Security, and E-Government Acts and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies requires limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII 
against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention.  This includes PII collected on behalf of 
the government for non-governmental purposes.  The Counter Solution with carrier collection has 
the lowest degree of privacy of all alternatives since the biometric data must be collected by a 
private company and then transferred to the Government as with all solutions utilizing carrier 
collection business processes.  
3.3.4 TSA Solution 
Alternative 2:  At Security Check-Point – U.S. Government collection.  A U.S. Government 
representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the security checkpoint. 
Alternative 2 is also referred to as the TSA Solution.  The alien traveler is processed once at exit at 
the TSA Security Checkpoint by a Government employee, after air or sea check-in and with no 
further verification or processing before departure. There is no TSA presence at seaports; therefore 
this alternative is not applicable to sea carriers. 
TSA Solution Highlights 
TSA Solution highlights include: 
• Relatively high percentage of population captured 
• No additional operational impact to the airlines 
• Low implementation cost to the airlines 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  32
• Low likelihood of non-U.S. Government use of PII 
• High confidence in IT security 
• Low number of collection points (one) 
• Low training cost to airlines 
Operational Impacts to the Alien Traveler, Carrier, and DHS – The TSA Solution may add 
additional processing time for the alien air traveler as opposed to other solutions, where 
biographic data are taken for association with the biometric collection are already taken in 
conjunction with existing processes. 
The TSA Solution does not directly impact the operations of airlines since the biometric 
information is collected by a Government employee at an established non-carrier security 
checkpoint. 
The TSA Solution would either add significant processing time to DHS operations, or require a 
significant expansion of labor in order to maintain current processing times.  The existing 
processes at the TSA security checkpoint do not deal with identity management, but rather their 
primary purpose is to screen persons and luggage; therefore, an entirely new process would have 
to be established operationally by DHS. 
Conceptual Financial Burden to Carriers and DHS – The conceptual financial burden, which 
includes development and implementation of all biometric collection equipment and related 
software, is most significant for DHS under the TSA Solution, since capture occurs at TSA security 
checkpoints and not at carrier check-in or departure gates.  Accordingly, the conceptual financial 
burden is the least significant for airlines under the TSA Solution. 
Need for Additional Network for Connectivity – The TSA Solution would require installation 
and operation of a network and connectivity structure, since one does not currently exist at the 
TSA security checkpoint.  Network connectivity does currently exist at carrier counters and gates; 
however, biometric collection would still have to be integrated with existing carrier systems.  
Therefore, the TSA Solution has a greater need for additional network and connectivity 
infrastructure than the Counter or Carrier Discretion Solutions. 
IT Security Complexity – The TSA Solution has a high level of IT security since DHS has sole 
custody of the biometric information from collection to transmission to storage and retrieval.  This 
would not be the case under the Counter or Carrier Discretion Solutions, where carrier networks 
would collect and then transmit the biometric information to DHS’s network.  The chance of any 
unauthorized use or misuse or intentional or unintentional compromise of equipment, data, 
software, or communication infrastructure is lower with one entity (DHS) than many 
(international air and sea carriers and DHS).   
Privacy – Successful compliance with the Privacy, Homeland Security, and E-Government Acts and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies requires limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII 
against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention.  This includes PII collected on behalf of 
the Government for non-Governmental purposes.  The TSA Solution has a higher degree of privacy 
confidence than the Counter or Carrier Discretion Solutions since DHS maintains custody of PII 
throughout its lifecycle.

3.3.5 Carrier Discretion Solution with Government 
Implementation 
The Carrier Discretion Solution, with its two alternatives (the Proposed Rule and Alternative 3), 
allows processing of alien travelers at a location of each airline’s choosing based on airport 
terminal layout, current and future business practices, and/or operational efficiency. By providing 
this flexibility, these two alternatives permit a significant reduction in airport coverage from a 
significant portion of the 455 airports where TSA maintains presence, to the 73 major airports 
with international flights served by airlines with more than 1,500 employees. Furthermore, this 
flexible processing path offers greater convenience and lowers risk of missed flights for those 
passengers arriving on connecting flights, who would otherwise need to re-enter the airport for 
departure processing.  
Carrier Discretion Solution Highlights 
Alternative 3:  Carrier Discretion Solution, U.S. Government Implementation. In this 
alternative, US-VISIT (rather than the airlines and sea carriers) will develop and deploy the 
solution to the location chosen by each airline.  The carriers will have responsibility to assist with 
connectivity to their network to enable set up of an electronic connection to a DHS server to send 
transactions.  US-VISIT will build the biometric collection devices and deploy them to the chosen 
locations.  While government Work Station Attendants (Attendants) will be available to provide 
assistance and respond to problems as necessary, carrier personnel will mainly be responsible for 
the actual collection of the biometrics.   
 
With the preceding exceptions, all other application, development, and acquisition costs will be 
incurred by the Government.   
Carrier Discretion Solution with U.S. Government collection highlights include:  
• Flexible solution allows airline to place the scanning devices at the location that best fits 
that particular airline and/or international airport. 
• High level of confidence of departure with possible gate collection 
• Low cost of implementation to airline 
• High level of privacy ensured 
• High confidence in security 
Operational Impacts to the Alien, Carrier, and DHS – Operational impacts are assumed to be 
significant for the alien in terms of processing time, whether biometrics are collected at the 
counter or the gate.  The carrier would experience processing delays from the new procedure 
implemented at their counters or gates, which may result in flight delays. Operational impacts to 
the Government would also be significant because DHS currently does not have a presence at the 
counter or boarding gate; therefore, an entirely new process would have to be established by DHS. 
Conceptual Financial Burden to the Carriers and DHS – When the Government collects the 
biometrics, the cost burden is favorable for the carriers. 
Need for Additional Network or Connectivity – At the check-in counters, there is existing 
network and connectivity structures available.  Biometric collection would have to be integrated 
with these systems.  Also, the Carrier Discretion Solution collected by the Government offers a 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  34
high level of IT security since DHS holds the information from the point of collection to storage 
and retrieval.   
Privacy – Successful compliance with the Privacy, Homeland Security, and E-Government Acts and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies requires limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII 
against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention.  This includes PII collected on behalf of 
the Government for non-Governmental purposes.  The Carrier Discretion Solution with 
Government collection has a higher degree of privacy since the biometric data are collected by the 
Government and will not be transferred through other agencies or entities.   
3.3.6 Kiosk Solution with Government Implementation 
 
Alternative 4:  Kiosk Solution, U.S. Government Implementation. The alien will be instructed 
by the carrier to proceed to a US-VISIT exit kiosk at the time of their departure. The carrier will 
be required to notate on the boarding pass (whether paper or electronic) that the person must 
provide biometrics before departure. The kiosk will be available before or after the security 
checkpoint for passengers newly arriving at airports. The carrier is subject to penalty for 
boarding the alien who has not complied with exit requirements. A cruise line passenger 
provides biometrics at the time of check-in.  
Kiosk Solution Highlights 
Kiosk Solution highlights include: 
• Low operational impact to the airlines 
• Low implementation cost to the airlines 
• Zero likelihood of non-U.S. Government use of PII 
• High confidence in IT security 
• Low number of collection points (one in many cases10) 
• Low training cost to airlines 
• High confidence in departure with receipt collection at gate 
Operational Impacts to the Alien Traveler, Carrier, and DHS – The Kiosk Solution may add 
additional processing time for the alien traveler as opposed to other solutions, where biographics 
taken for association with the biometric collection are already taken in conjunction with existing 
processes. 
The Kiosk Solution does not directly impact the operations of airlines since the biometric 
information is collected by a Government employee at an airport kiosk cluster location not 
associated with the carriers. The only implementation cost to the carrier is to determine if a 
                                               
10 One collection point assumes that there is only location for kiosks that is used by both newly arriving passengers at 
an airport and connecting flight passengers.

traveler is an alien.  Verification at gates can be done at minimal additional cost assuming no 
biometric verification; the gate attendant would only need to examine a receipt from the kiosk.  
The Kiosk Solution adds a new process to US-VISIT and would require an expansion of labor.  
Conceptual Financial Burden to Carriers and DHS – The conceptual financial burden, which 
includes development and implementation of all biometric collection equipment and related 
software, is significant for DHS under the Kiosk Solution, since capture occurs at kiosks which are 
staffed by DHS personnel. The conceptual financial burden is the less significant for airlines under 
the Kiosk Solution.  Airlines would have to add new applications to identify aliens at ticketing and 
reservations as well as produce two dimensional barcodes on boarding passes. 
Need for Additional Network for Connectivity – The Kiosk Solution would require installation 
and operation of a network and connectivity structure, since one does not currently exist at the 
kiosk cluster areas.  Network connectivity does currently exist at carrier counters and gates.  The 
Kiosk Solution would have the greatest infrastructure needs, requiring extensive cabling, 
negotiation of lease space with port authorities and the installation of signage. 
IT Security Complexity – The Kiosk Solution has a high level of IT security since DHS has sole 
custody of the biometric information from collection to transmission to storage and retrieval.  This 
would not be the case under the Counter or Carrier Discretion Solutions, where carrier networks 
would collect and then transmit the biometric information to DHS’s network.  The chance of any 
unauthorized use or misuse or intentional or unintentional compromise of equipment, data, 
software, or communication infrastructure is lower with one entity (DHS) than many 
(international air and sea carriers and DHS).   
Privacy – Successful compliance with the Privacy, Homeland Security, and E-Government Acts and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies requires limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII 
against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention.  This includes PII collected on behalf of 
the Government for non-Governmental purposes.  The Kiosk Solution has a higher degree of 
privacy confidence than the Counter or Carrier Discretion Solutions since DHS maintains custody 
of PII throughout its lifecycle.

4 Cost Estimation 
This section provides an overview of the cost modeling approach, key cost assumptions, and 
summary tables for the cost estimates. The cost modeling approach explains the steps taken to 
gather and model costs and details the work breakdown structure elements and cost categories, as 
well as explains the risk factors applied to the cost estimates. Global cost assumptions are explained 
in the key cost assumptions section, with detailed cost assumptions available in Appendix A.  
4.1 Cost Modeling Approach 
Cost estimation is critical because it provides a basis for comparing dollar and resource 
commitments necessary to achieve each alternative, and allows for a determination of the 
feasibility of funding a given alternative. Once an alternative is selected, the costs associated with 
that alternative can be used as a benchmark for internal US-VISIT planning purposes. 
The costs in this document, for each alternative, reflect incremental costs relative to the current 
“As-Is” state; that is the system capabilities prior to implementing any changes. These costs were 
estimated using a combination of estimating techniques, including (in descending order of level 
of rigor): 
• Buildup cost modeling based upon analogous project experience 
• Parametric cost estimation using appropriate sizing of project scope  
• Negative economic impact analysis based on additional processing time, estimated 
frequency of flight delay and the value of time in dollars  
• Expert opinion based upon cost estimation best practices for those project elements 
lacking specificity of scope definition  
Multiple approaches are used because the objective is to develop the best estimates possible in the 
formative stage of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit project. As such, the underlying assumptions behind 
cost estimation relationships are documented to provide transparency.  
The cost model generates present value costs for each alternative, on a yearly basis, over the next 
20 years. The period of investment for the workstream occurs over the first 15 months. A 
workbook organized by alternatives was created within the model for each alternative.  
4.1.1 Cost Phases, Categories, and Elements 
Costs are organized by life cycle phase and each phase is broken down into as many as seven cost 
categories. Costs are assigned to either DHS or Airlines/Sea Carrier workstreams. The primary cost 
elements of the life cycle phase used in this analysis are: 
Planning –the planning costs include capital expenditure (labor, hardware, software, and 
facilities), program management costs, hardware refresh costs, and cost efficiencies from 
retired or replaced systems. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  37
Analyze – the analyze costs include studying the problem and the creation of the program 
requirements and the project strategy documents. 
Design – the design costs include looking at the potential solutions and determining the most 
effective and efficient way to construct the solution. 
Build – the build costs include the preliminary construction of the solution.  
Test – the test costs include proving that the solution meets the business requirements and is 
correct, while at the same time proving that there are no errors or defects. 
Deploy – the deploy costs include the final process of moving the solution from development 
status to production status. This process is often called implementation, go-live, roll out and 
installation. 
After all assumptions and costs are collected, detailed summary costs are generated for each 
alternative, covering nine cost categories: 
Program Management – the cost associated with all the tasks that go into the investigation, 
scoping and definition of the selected alternative. 
Independent Verification & Validation – the cost associated with the independent 
verification and validation pertaining to all software and hardware for the solution.  
Information Technology – the cost associated with the acquisition of the information 
technology required for the solution, including labor, software and hardware costs. 
Facilities Cost – the cost associated with modifying, leasing, or expanding space in support of 
performing a given alternative. Facilities costs can include physical infrastructure 
modifications, process space modifications, leased technology support service space, 
technology support modifications, related expansion construction, and 
mobilization/outreach/field support. 
Training Cost – the cost associated with familiarizing the workforce with new technology, 
business processes and standard operating procedures as a result of an alternative being 
implemented.  
Outreach Cost – the cost associated with the requirement to support an information campaign 
related to the alternative exit solutions to all stakeholders through each phase of the 
initiative. 
Disruption Costs – the cost associated with the extra processing time for collecting biometrics 
to all stakeholders, including travelers. 
Delay Costs – the cost to the airlines of incremental flight delay caused by passenger delays 
during biometrics collections. 
Other Costs – includes all other costs necessary to deliver an operating capability to all 
stakeholders.  
4.1.2 Cost Estimates Probability-Based Ranges 
Original cost estimates were developed as most probable costs. For the Air/Sea Biometric Exit RIA, 
generally accepted cost engineering risk ranges are applied to these most probable cost estimates at 
the cost category level. The Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE)

*The state of process technology and availability of applicable reference cost data affect the range markedly. The ± 
value represents typical percentage variation of actual costs from the cost estimate after application of contingency 
for a given scope (typically a 50% level of confidence). 
**If the range index value of 1 represents 0.005% of project costs, then an index value of 100 represents 0.5%. 
Estimate preparation effort is highly dependent upon the size of the project and the quality of estimating data and 
tools.  
Based on the current level of project definition for Air/Sea Biometric Exit, Class 5 risk factors have 
been applied to all stakeholder estimates. The nature of these cost risk factors lead to risk adjusted 
costs, which are used to calculate key outcomes, being higher than the most probable values

Date: 04-17-2008  39
provided by stakeholders. In the cost section of this document the most probable values, consistent 
with those provided by stakeholders, are reported.   
4.1.3 Negative Economic Impact Analysis 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit will negatively affect carriers and travelers due to the additional time 
required for the collection and processing of biometric information.  It is anticipated that Exit will 
increase traveler queue and processing time and have an impact on flight delays. 
The rationale for increased traveler queue and processing time is as follows: 
• Collection of biometric data is beyond the current processing requirements for an alien 
traveler and may create additional processing time for travelers. 
• Out-of-scope travelers will also be impacted by the longer processing times required of 
other travelers since they will be in the same processing locations throughout the 
airport/cruise line terminal. 
• Additional processing time will create longer queues at processing locations for travelers, 
increasing waiting times at airports/cruise line terminals.   
The rationale for an impact on flight delays is as follows: 
• The new process of collecting biometrics at the airport may create longer processing times 
for travelers.  The longer processing times may create flight delays as airline carriers and 
travelers adjust to the new processing systems. 
• For airlines, the operational impact of collecting biometrics is calculated by the value of 
annual flight delay and the flight delays caused by additional processing time.  In the long 
run, carriers may run fewer flights. 
4.2 Key Cost Assumptions 
Operations and Maintenance – Based upon the consensus of experts, O&M was estimated to 
be 15% of development costs in year 1 and year 2, 12% in year 3, and 9% in year 4 and 
beyond over the course of the life cycle of the solution, with the following exceptions: 
program management costs would be sustained at a rate of 40 percent of the investment 
total per year through the O&M period and data communication circuits will be an annually 
recurring cost.  Also included in O&M are hardware refresh costs and operational labor that 
differ by alternative.  The O&M cost covers all recurring costs associated with training, 
hardware and software. Workforce has an annual recurring factor of 100% of all labor 
acquisition costs, which includes both contractor and government labor costs.   
Program Management – Program management cost to airlines and sea carriers is estimated at 
15 percent of their acquisition costs. The cost to the government is also estimated at 
approximately 15 percent of the acquisition cost.  Program management cost applies to the 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  40
management and oversight of all investments and because of its nature; it was estimated for 
the years when investments were made. 
Discount Rate – OMB Circulars A-94 and A-4 require the use of a 7% and a 3% real discount 
rate when analyzing public investments and regulations.  Both are used in this analysis to 
provide contrasting present value estimations.11 
In the Proposed Rule, the Carrier Discretion Solution with Carrier Implementation, the key cost 
assumptions are:  
• Deployment will be a total of 73 airports with international departures and 33 seaports. 
• The cost of the collection device will be $7,500, assuming that the airlines and sea 
carriers will not be able to negotiate greater discounts than the government. 
• The total number of collection devices to be acquired is 7,176 (4,434 for airports, 2,742 
for seaports). The number of stations used to calculate the number of staff is slightly 
lower.  This is based on the inclusion of additional gates to which the solution will be 
deployed at the airports and the assumption that the staff will not need to increase to 
accommodate this increase in gates as the numbers of flights and travelers will not 
change.  The number of stations used to calculate the staffing level is 6,166 (3,424 for 
airports, 2,742 for seaports). 
• All software development for US-VISIT effort will be the responsibility of the 
government. 
For a more detailed account of key cost assumptions by alternative, see Appendix A, Section A.1.9. 
Differences between cost estimates for each of the alternatives vary based on assumptions made for 
the costs of: 
• Type of collection device 
• Industry software engineering 
• Construction 
• Government software engineering 
• Work station attendants (Attendants) 
Cost Category Assumptions for the Proposed Rule: 
Program Management cost assumptions: 
• Government program management costs will be factored at a rate of 15 percent of the 
total cost of the program. 
• Carrier program management costs will be factored at a rate of 15 percent of the total 
cost of the program. 
Independent Verification and Validation cost assumptions:

• IV&V costs for the government are estimated based on supporting 8 planning/working 
group meetings during the development phase, development of all UDM artifacts, and 
on historical costs. 
• IV&V costs for the carriers are factored at a rate of 1 percent of the total application 
development costs. 
Other government partners cost assumptions: 
• Costs associated with IDENT, ADIS, and CBP were estimated as described in Sections 
A.1.3.2, A.1.3.3, and A.1.3.4. 
Information Technology cost assumptions: 
• Application development costs are estimated according to the methodology as 
described in Section A.1.3.5.  The carriers will develop the application to communicate 
with and send biometric data to the government servers, while US-VISIT will develop 
the application to receive the communication from the carriers.  The carriers will 
develop and deploy their own applications, and the government will develop and 
deploy its application. 
• The number of devices to be deployed was estimated in the same manner as described 
in Section A.1.3.6.  The devices will be deployed to departure gate areas in 80 percent 
of airports, and to counter areas in the remaining airports where a departure gate 
solution is infeasible, and to the counter area in all seaports.12  The devices will be 
purchased by the carriers at a cost of $7,500 per device.13   
• The development and test hardware costs for the carriers were estimated at a factor of 5 
percent of the total acquisition costs.  The development and test hardware costs for the 
government are estimated based on an estimate provided by ITM, and include costs for 
lab setup, and support testing for CBP, ADIS, and IDENT. 
• The data communications circuit and network connectivity costs are estimated based 
on the methodology described in Sections A.1.3.8 and A.1.3.9. 
Facilities cost assumptions: 
• Facilities costs are estimated based on the methodology described in Section A.1.4. 
• All Facilities costs are incurred by the carriers. 
Training cost assumptions: 
• Training costs for both the carriers and the government are estimated based on the 
assumptions and methodology outlined in Section A.1.5. 
Outreach cost assumptions: 
• Outreach costs are assumed to be $2,000,000 for the government.  This is in line with 
an estimate provided by the US-VISIT Office of Program Integration and Mission 
Services. 
                                               
12 Due to the requirements of the cost modeling, the proportion of deployment to counter and gate is a fixed, base 
assumption.  The Counter Solution, which deploys only to the counter, can be considered a variation on this 
assumption. 
13 Uncertainty in the cost of devices is addressed using generally accepted cost engineering risk ranges as described in 
Section 4.1.2. 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  42
• Outreach costs for the carriers are estimated to be 5 percent of the total program cost 
less program management and training costs. 
O&M cost assumptions: 
o As the investment phase is anticipated to last 3 months into the second fiscal year of 
the program lifecycle, it is assumed that the O&M will begin in the second quarter of 
FY2009. 
o Those costs associated with maintaining the updates to ADIS, CBP, and the 
development of the application will continue at a steadily declining rate (15 percent in 
year 2, 12 percent in year 3, 9 percent in years 4 and beyond) as it is assumed that 
major problems with the system will decrease as the program matures.  As the 
investment phase extends three months into the second year of the program, annual 
costs are reduced by 25 percent in the first year of O&M.  This 25 percent reduction 
factor does not apply to years beyond year two. 
o Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment total 
Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two   
o Hardware and COTS software maintenance costs will continue at rates of 10 percent 
and 18 percent respectively of the investment costs of the program, beginning one year 
after installation. 
o Data communications circuit costs ($30 per carrier per port per month) will remain at 
the same rate as estimated in the Investment Phase, as these costs will remain constant 
through the life of the program. 
o Each counter and gate at an airport would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 days 
per week.  As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing passengers 7 
days a week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation for 6 hours per 
day, 4 days per week.  Attendants will be present to handle technical issues and 
problem resolution for the scanning devices. 
o At the airport check-in counters, each attendant will be able to monitor each of 
the workstations installed at an individual counter location (about 6 in the large 
airports, 4 in the medium airports, 2 in the small airports).  At the seaport 
check-in counters, each attendant will be able to monitor 6 workstations, the 
number installed at a counter in a seaport. 
o At the departure gates, each attendant will be able to monitor 2 workstations.  
Interviews with SMEs at TSA revealed that the existing carrier staff at the 
departure gates will be able to absorb 1/3 of the functionality of US-VISIT 
Biometric Exit with no additional staffing.  Additional staff will be added to 
accommodate the remaining 2/3 of the Exit functionality.  While the number 
of devices deployed to the gates has been increased by 50 percent to 
compensate for airlines that do not segregate their departure gates by domestic 
and international flights, the number of staff has not been increased since the 
numbers of flights and in-scope alien travelers is not assumed to change as a 
result of this increase.  Even though devices will be deployed to additional 
gates, not all of these gates will need to be in operation at the same time. 
o This results in 7,073,014 additional attendant hours to be billed. 
 Attendant support begins at FOC, currently the second quarter of FY 2009. 
o The labor rate was assumed to be $33.52 per hour.  This rate was determined based on 
the hourly rate of a conservative annual salary estimate of $60,000 per year for the 
carrier-employed counter representatives divided by 1,790 billable hours per year.  
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  43
o 52 million aliens per year would exit through the ports, each requiring an average of 
66.6 seconds worth of additional time to process, the majority of which is additional 
queue time.  Current carrier counter personnel will assist with the majority of 
transactions as part of the normal check-in process with carrier-employed attendants 
assisting with uncharacteristic transactions and responding to problems and questions. 
 This results in about 962,000 total counter hours per year to staff the devices. 
 In year 2, counter support begins in the second quarter of FY 2009. 
 These new hours will be charged at the above described labor rate. 
o Important observation about attendant headcounts and costs: 
 The total number of attendants appears large in comparison to the number of 
stations to be deployed.  This happens because each attendant will work a 40 
hour week, and each station is in operation for 18 hours per day, seven days 
per week, or 126 hours per week (at the airports) or 6 hours per day, four days 
per week (at the seaports).  Even though each attendant monitors more than 
one station at a time, the operational time per year of each station requires 
multiple shifts per day, which in turn causes the number of full-time attendants 
to be relatively high in comparison to the number of devices. 
 The table below shows the total headcount of attendants required to implement 
the Proposed Rule.

Disruption Cost Assumptions 
• The additional queue time is estimated at 53.6 seconds and the additional processing time 
at 13 seconds per alien.14  With two exceptions: 
o The Proposed Rule and Alternative 3 both have a larger processing and queue time 
estimate for medium and small airports. This is due to the fact that a fraction of 
alien travelers arriving in the sterile area of an airport that has deployed biometric 
collection at the counter from an out-of-scope domestic airport must leave the 
sterile area to submit their biometric information and then return to the sterile area 
prior to exiting the country. 
o The TSA alternative will have a slightly longer processing time, but due to 
increased operational labor no additional queue time is expected. 
                                               
14 Time is estimated based on information obtained from US-VISIT and TSA subject matter experts (SMEs). 
US-VISIT Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  44
o The Kiosk alternative has an additional processing time of 73.2 seconds and an 
average of 63.7 seconds of additional queue time per alien traveler. Processing time 
only affects alien travelers.   
• For out-of-scope travelers, travelers not required to provide biometric exit information, it 
is assumed that their travel is only impacted by the queue delay of 53.6 seconds.  
Approximately 43%15 of out-of-scope travelers will be affected by delays due to the 
deployment of biometric collection at the counter, or deployment at kiosks where receipt 
collection at the gate will increase queue time for all travelers.  Also, since the Proposed 
Rule and Alternative 3 have biometric collection taking place at the counter at 20 percent 
of airports, it is assumed that 8.6 percent of out-of-scope passengers will be affected. 
Delay Cost Assumptions 
• It is assumed that the average number of annual flight delays caused by the exit solution is 
58716 and the average flight delay is estimated at 50 minutes.17  
• The cost per minute of delay for airlines is calculated as $57.1118 and the analysis assumes 
a value of time for air travelers of $28.60.19   
• For the TSA Solution, there is assumed to be an additional 7 seconds in preparation and 
processing time required for a Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) scan of the alien’s travel 
documents.  This is due to the need to associate biometric information with biographics.  
TSA does not currently collect biographic information during the security screening 
process, therefore this is incremental time that must be added for the TSA Solution. 
Carriers currently collect this information during check-in.  
• The number of delays is assumed to grow at 4% annually, the growth rate of travel.   
• It is also assumed that there is no difference in flight delays between the alternatives being 
considered for Exit. 
We solicit any comments to improve the analysis to the greatest extent possible.  Comments may 
be submitted to the regulatory docket using any of the methods listed under ADDRESSES in the 
preamble to the Proposed Rule.

4.3 Cost Scope 
This section examines the cost estimates of the Proposed Rule and four alternative Air/Sea Exit 
solutions.  The alternatives examine four distinct solutions, at different locations throughout the 
airport where a biometric collection could take place.  Because of the layout of a typical seaport, 
the biometric collection will occur only at the check-in area.  These alternatives also vary based on 
whether the airlines/sea carriers or the government would be implementing the solution. 
Depending on the solution, there are differing combinations of airport/seaport and airline/sea 
carrier that will affect the number of devices that will be required for each solution.  The specific 
cost elements that feed each solution are described in the appropriate sections below. 
4.4 Cost Estimates 
This subsection provides a high-level table summary of costs by alternatives followed by an 
analysis of the key cost drivers and major cost differences between the alternatives.  
4.4.1 Table Summary of Costs By Alternatives 
The following tables summarize costs, including disruption and delay costs from increased queue 
time, across the five alternatives. The first table summarizes total costs for each alternative by 
acquisition cost category and program management and operations and maintenance costs. The 
second table separates the costs to the Government and carriers. All costs are presented as present 
value total costs from 2008 to 2027 in millions of 2008 dollars. 
The difference in investment costs are a result of the differing numbers of carriers and ports 
assumed for each alternative.  In the Proposed Rule, it is assumed that 80 airlines and 9 sea carriers 
will deploy the solution to 73 airports and 33 seaports, with the assumption being that each 
carrier will have to develop their own solution.  In Alternative 1, it is assumed that 104 airlines 
and 9 sea carriers would develop individual solutions and deploy them to 304 airports and 33 
seaports.  In Alternative 2, the government will be developing a single solution, but will be 
deploying to a much larger number of ports, as it will need to provide the capability in each 
airport with a TSA presence.  In Alternative 3, it is assumed that the government will deploy the 
solution, and will be able to develop a single solution, rather than each of the carriers needing to 
develop their own.  The number of devices needed for a counter and/or gate-based solution is 
also significantly larger than the number needed for the TSA checkpoint solution (3,734 devices 
for the TSA checkpoint solution, anywhere from 6,166 to 11,990 for counter and gate-based 
solutions). In Alternative 4, it is assumed that the government will deploy the solution, a total of 
1,952 kiosks.   
As is evident in looking at the following total cost tables, the biggest differences in costs are found 
in the O&M costs.  This is primarily a result of the staff necessary to operate the solution, primarily 
driven by the type and number of devices used in each solution.  For example, in Alternative 2, 
even though the number of devices is smaller than the other alternatives, the fact that they are 
mobile devices means that a single attendant can only monitor one device at a time.  In other 
solutions, the layout of the counter and gate-based devices allows for each attendant to cover 
multiple devices simultaneously.  Also, in Alternative 2, additional Travel Document Checkers

(TDCs) were included to minimize the impact on the delays that could result from the current 
TDCs need to determine which travelers are in scope.  This effectively doubled the number of staff 
that was estimated for the TSA checkpoint solution.

4.4.2 Disruption Costs 
This section discusses the logic and measurement of delay and disruption cost estimates.  The 
estimate calculations use the disruption and delay cost assumptions mentioned previously in 
Section 4.2.  
Figure 4-1 describes the logic employed to estimate delay and disruption costs to passengers (both 
aliens and out-of-scope travelers).

Increased traveler queue and processing time  
Collecting biometric data is beyond the current processing operations and may create additional 
processing and waiting time for travelers.  The impact of these delays is expected to vary 
depending on implementation alternative, as different populations may be impacted, and by 
airport size.  For example, in the TSA Solution, all travelers may be impacted, not simply alien

travelers, whereas in a carrier discretion solution, the impact on out-of-scope travelers may be less.  
This negative economic impact is measured by the value of time for the traveler and the estimated 
time increase created by the collection of biometric data at the counter, security checkpoint, or 
gate.   
To calculate this negative economic impact, the total incremental waiting and processing time is 
determined based on the additional step of processing biometrics at exit. For the Proposed Rule, 
the additional queue time is estimated at 53.6 seconds and the additional processing time at 13 
seconds. The TSA prep and processing time estimate for aliens is 20 seconds (13 seconds for the 
biometric scan and 7 seconds for biographic information collection).20 Due to increased 
operational labor, the TSA Solution is not expected to increase queue times.  However, the TSA 
Solution has an additional 7 seconds of processing time compared to the Carrier Discretion 
Solution since biographic information collection would be an entirely new process at the TSA 
checkpoint. This time involves taking a MRZ scan of an alien’s travel documents.21 The Kiosk 
Solution involves an increase in queue time and processing time but these increases primarily 
affect the alien travelers.  In this solution, it is assumed that out-of-scope passengers that check in 
at the counter will be affected by a 10 second processing delay.

For out-of-scope travelers, travelers not required to provide biometric exit information, it is 
assumed that their travel is only impacted by queue delays.  Under the Proposed Rule, using the 
53.6 seconds of additional queue time and a volume of out-of-scope travelers estimated at 67.5M 
annually, with approximately 43%22 of these travelers impacted by the exit solution, results in 
60.3 million minutes of additional waiting time.  Based on an hourly value of time of $28.60,23 
this results in an annual negative economic impact of $28.7M for out-of-scope travelers.  This 
value is assumed to grow at the 4% annual growth rate in travel.   
To compute the total time increase for alien travelers, this additional time is applied to the total 
number of aliens exiting.  This is multiplied by the value of time of aliens to determine the total 
cost of delay to aliens.  The additional wait time created by the new biometric collection process 
may also impact out-of-scope travelers, depending on the implementation location.  Under

alternatives where wait times for out-of-scope travelers are increased, these wait times are 
multiplied by the estimated number of out-of-scope air travelers impacted in each alternative.  
This is monetized using the value of time for these travelers.  These total delay costs for both alien 
and out-of-scope travelers are summed resulting in the total value of additional time brought 
about by the Exit procedures, represented as a negative economic impact. 
Impact on flight delays 
The expected increase in traveler queue and processing time may lead to flight delays as airline 
carriers and travelers adjust to new processing systems. For the negative economic impact affecting 
airlines, the operational impact of collecting biometrics is calculated by the cost of flight delays to 
the airlines and the flight delays caused by additional processing time. For the negative economic 
impact to passengers, the operational impact is measured by the passengers’ value of time and the 
length of the delay.   
Multiplying the average number of annual flight delays caused by the Exit solution of 58724 by the 
average flight delay of 50 minutes25 yields an aggregate flight delay in minutes per year of 29,350 
minutes.  Using a cost per minute of delay for airlines of $57.1126 results in a total economic cost 
impact of flight delay of $1,676,179.   
The impact of passenger delays is estimated in a similar manner. Based on the 29,350 minutes of 
annual delay time and an average of 77 passengers per international flight,27 this results in an 
annual wait time for passengers of 2,259,950 minutes.  Assuming a value of time for air travelers 
of $28.6028, results in an annual economic cost impact of $64,634,570.  The number of delays is 
assumed to grow at 4% annually, the growth rate of travel.  It is assumed that there is no 
difference in flight delays between the alternatives being considered for Exit. 
The calculation of the impact of flight delays begins with the base case of flights that are delayed. 
This is impacted by an assumed percentage of flights delayed caused from the implementation of 
collecting biometrics of aliens at airline counters, gates or security checkpoints. This incremental 
increase of flights delayed is broken down by the delay in minutes and the total outbound flights 
to determine the incremental aggregate flight delay in minutes.  This total delay is then monetized 
by the average delay cost for airlines, which results in the total value of flight delay for airlines.  
The total delay in minutes is also monetized by the total number of passengers’ average value of 
time, resulting in the total value of flight delay for travelers.

4.4.3 Cost Differences Between Alternatives 
The cost estimation varies by alternative due to assumptions about who is responsible for 
implementation, deployment, and operation, including variations in the cost of operational labor 
provided for the management and support of the program.  The Carrier Discretion Solution is 
assumed to deploy at the counter or gate at 73 airports which requires significantly less 
operational labor than the counter-based solution, which is assumed to deploy at 304 airports or 
at the TSA security checkpoint which is assumed to deploy at 455 airports.  It is also important to 
note that the government can access significant cost savings on the biometric collection devices 
when they are responsible for implementation of the alternative.  
Assumptions about labor hours should especially be of note for the TSA implementation for two 
reasons.  First, the TSA Solution assumes a mobile collection device that requires a one-to-one 
ratio of collection devices to Attendants. This impacts the operational labor required for the 
solution.  Second, there is currently no TSA presence for sea carriers and to make up for this fact 
deployment at the security checkpoint will require higher operational labor throughout the life 
cycle of the solution.  Costs estimated for solutions at the Counter will tend to be higher because it 
is assumed to be deployed at a total of 304 airports. 
Delay and disruption costs vary based on the location of the alternative and airport size; however, 
these delays and disruptions are assumed not to vary based on which stakeholder is responsible for 
implementation of the alternative.  The location of deployment determines the number of travelers 
estimated to be affected by the solution.  The Counter Solution will cause delays for both alien 
travelers and out-of-scope travelers to increase by an estimated 66.6 seconds and 53.6 seconds per 
traveler, respectively.29  The TSA Solution, which has the lowest delay costs of all the alternatives, 
affects only alien travelers by an estimated 20.0 seconds per traveler.  The Kiosk Solution will 
increase alien and out-of-scope travelers’ queue time by 58.6 seconds per traveler; processing time 
will increase 73.2 seconds per traveler for alien travelers. It is assumed that the out-of-scope 
passengers that check in at the counter will be affected by a 10 second processing delay.  The 
Carrier Discretion Solution, which is a hybrid solution that, for the purposes of this analysis, 
assumes 20 percent of airports implement the counter solution and the remaining 80 percent 
implement the gate solutions, will affect alien travelers as well as a small fraction of out-of-scope 
travelers.   
Alien travelers leaving the country via large airports, who have arrived in the airport from a prior 
domestic flight, will incur an estimated delay of 66.6 seconds per traveler.  It is estimated that the 
majority of these travelers will not have to exit the sterile area during transfer solely for the 
purpose of submitting biometrics, since it is assumed that all large airports will either have 
deployed at the gate or have ticket counters in the sterile area.  However, for small and medium 
size airports that have chosen the counter option there will be a fraction of alien passengers 
arriving on a domestic flight into the sterile area of these airport who will need to exit the sterile 
area to submit biometrics at the check-in counter.  These alien passengers are assumed to incur a 
45 minute delay to leave the sterile area and submit to biometric collection and return to their 
gate.  It is estimated that approximately 1 percent of all alien travelers will incur this larger delay. 
                                               
29 Estimates described in this section are the median estimates.  For the range estimates please see Appendices A and B. 
US-VISIT                                                                             Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  62
However, the remaining alien travelers with flights out of small and medium sized airports that 
have deployed the gate option will incur delays of 66.6 seconds per traveler with no delays to out-
of-scope passengers. For further discussion of passenger delays, please see Section 4.4.2. 
Counter solutions are estimated to be the most expensive in terms of total cost to deploy and 
operate after deployment, followed by locating the collection activities at the security checkpoint.  
However, the TSA Solution is estimated to have the lowest overall disruption and delay costs.  This 
is due to the fact that by placing an extra Travel Document Checker (TDC) at the document 
checking station, in addition to the Attendant taking the biometric information, there is estimated 
to be no queue time impact in aggregate.  For this reason, the Proposed Rule and Alternative 3 are 
estimated to be much more costly than the TSA Solution in terms of disruption and delay costs.  
This is largely due to the fact that, in order to facilitate estimation of costs, a modeling assumption 
was made that 80% of airports deploy at the gate while 20% deploy at the counter.  However, 
these two alternatives (the Proposed Rule and Alternative 3), actually allow airlines to deploy as 
they see fit, within certain boundaries.  One might imagine that if a pure gate solution is, in fact, 
the least costly, airlines would deploy at the gate to the greatest extent possible.  It should also be 
noted that government deployment alternatives are estimated to be less costly in terms of 
acquisition costs than alternatives with the same deployment location or terms, but for which the 
carriers pay and operate.  This is due to an assumption that government can access volume 
discounts not available to individual carriers as well as the reduced development needs that occur 
when a single entity manages the IT development.

5 Benefits Estimation 
This chapter describes the process employed to develop the measures and estimates of benefits and 
discusses what those measures are and how they relate to Departmental goals.  The goal of benefits 
estimation is to determine the value of cost avoidance and social benefit to be created through the 
implementation of each alternative. To achieve this goal, a set of measurable benefits has been 
defined and a process of measurement undertaken that engages stakeholders and subject matter 
experts, relies on quantifiable, measurable inputs, and utilizes advanced statistical techniques to 
account for uncertainty. The benefits estimates apply equally to the Proposed Rule and all 
alternatives; there is no difference in values across the Proposed Rule and the alternatives. It needs 
to be stressed that in some cases quantifiable may not imply monetizable. For example, a 
quantitative assessment of a key performance improvement may be valued as percent 
improvement in achieving desired results. 
A synopsis of the benefit categories that have been identified for Air/Sea Biometric Exit is provided 
in the next section of this chapter. Also included is a rationale explaining how Air/Sea Biometric 
Exit provides each specific category of benefit.  
5.1 Air/Sea Biometric Exit Benefits Summary 
The proposed Air/Sea Biometric Exit implementation alternatives deliver a range of benefits 
related to the capture and processing of biometric information. To establish the benefits 
attributable to Air/Sea Exit, the Cost Benefit Analysis Team reviewed key planning documents and 
developed a list of approximately eight potential benefits attributable to Exit. This list was 
condensed through further review and stakeholder interviews. A final condensed set of proposed 
benefits was developed and approved by US-VISIT. The final list of attributable benefits includes 
those benefits that staff and stakeholders believe are measurable and those which are qualitative in 
nature, and for which the impact associated with Air/Sea Biometric Exit can be distinguished from 
the impact of other initiatives.  The majority of identified benefits are measured quantitatively, 
while others are measured through a qualitative assessment process. Table 5-1 lists all the potential 
benefits identified along with whether they were treated as monetized, quantitative but not 
monetizable, qualitative, or not assessed. 
The following table describes the final list of Air/Sea Biometric Exit benefits for which estimation 
has been conducted.

enforcement. 
• Cost savings to the government from preventing an individual 
who has overstayed their visa and who has left the U.S. from re-
entering the U.S.  Costs that would be avoided with successful 
Exit implementation include detection and possible detention, 
prosecution, incarceration, and removal for egregious cases.

5.3 Measurement 
This section discusses the measurement methodology employed and the results of the benefits 
estimation by alternative. 
5.3.1 Measurement Approach 
The comprehensive RIA methodology is discussed in Section 7. Specific to the measurement of 
benefits, the following approach details should be noted: 
Statistical data 
Where possible, measurement is based on historical statistical data culled from a variety of 
government sources, including Bureau of Justice Statistics, Uniform Crime Reporting, CIS 
statistical abstracts, and other official sources. See Appendix B for a complete list of all data 
sources. 
Stakeholder input 
Where historical statistical data was unavailable, subject matter expert opinion was applied. Subject 
matter experts included technical and policy representatives from DHS and field experts. 
Uncertainty Ranges 
Key variables are stated in terms of a high, low, and median range of possible outcomes. The high 
represents the 95th percentile and the low represents the 5th percentile. These ranges are 
incorporated into a Monte Carlo analysis along with the cost uncertainty ranges discussed in 
Section 4.1.2 to produce risk ranges which describe the likelihood of a range of outcomes. 
Timeframe Analyzed 
The analysis covered a 20-year timeframe. 
Ramp-up and Roll-out 
This estimate assumes an investment phase of 15 months, and four years of supplemental 
Operations and Maintenance, for a total of five years of costs.  Costs are presented in FY 2008 
dollars. Ramp up and Roll out schedule is defined for the purposes of benefits estimation using 
the expected schedule of deployment. 
Discounting 
Discount rates of 7% and 3% are applied to the analysis. This is consistent with direction in OMB 
circulars A-4 and A-94. 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

5.3.2 Results of the Benefits Analysis 
This section presents the results of the benefits estimation by benefit type.  It should be noted that 
discussion of the net negative social impacts due to disruption and delay can be found in Cost 
Chapter 4.   
Improved Detection of Visa Overstays 
This benefit is realized prior to or at entry for those who have previously visited and exited under 
any of the Exit solution alternatives. The biometric data collected upon exit will allow for 
improved accuracy in reporting departure.  In estimation of this benefit, only egregious overstays, 
defined as overstays of 181 days or greater, are considered.  Detection of egregious overstays prior 
to or at entry is estimated as a cost savings to the Government, as the cost to search for, detain and 
deport an egregious overstayer is avoided.  This cost savings benefit is estimated based on the 
probability that an alien has previously overstayed by 181 days or greater, the estimated annual 
alien travel volume, the improved ability to identify prior visa overstays due to exit solution, and 
the cost associated with searching, detaining and deporting an egregious overstayer.   
This benefit is quantified and monetized as follows.  The probability that an alien has overstayed 
his/her visa in the past by 181 days or more is calculated based on the historical percentage of visa 
applications rejected on the grounds of prior egregious overstay.  In 2006, there were 7.7 million 
visa applications filed, of which, 7,890 were rejected on the grounds of prior egregious overstay.  
This results in 0.1% of visa applications being rejected for egregious overstay reasons.30  The alien 
air travel volume, which this percentage is applied to, is estimated to be 51.1M in 2006.31  It is 
estimated that the current ability to match entries to exits using the biographic exit system is 
88.1%32 (current match rate in ADIS), whereas under the biometric exit solution, this number is 
expected to improve to 95% in 2008, 97% in 2009 and 99% in 2010.33  Given that some aliens 
may attempt to evade or otherwise not comply with the requirements of the process, it is expected 
that a certain portion of the expected improvement may be eroded.  Using the 97% matching 
under each solution and assuming an equal distribution of overstays and non-overstays in the 
additional 8.9% of successful matches, there will be a 8.9% improvement in detecting egregious 
visa overstays.  Using the estimated 2008 travel volume of 55.3M (51.1M times 4% growth for 
two years) multiplied by the 0.1% probability of a prior egregious overstay results in a number of 
42,679 egregious overstayers detected in the baseline.  Applying the 8.9% improvement in 
detecting egregious overstays results in an additional 4,900 egregious overstays detected annually 
under the exit solution.  This volume when multiplied by the estimated cost of $19,20234 for 
removal had the alien not been detected prior to entry, results in an annual benefit of $94.1M.

Over the timeframe of analysis, this benefit is expected to grow at a rate of 4%, the projected 
growth in alien air travel.   
Increased Efficiency in DIG Workload due to Improved Matching Success of Entry to Exit 
Records  
The automated processing of biometric data improves processing and analytical efficiencies for the 
Data Integrity Group (DIG).  DIG performs human analysis primarily using ADIS data to identify 
data integrity issues for correction. Additionally, the DIG provides tactical data integrity support 
for operational units requiring complete and accurate alien entry, exit and status update 
information.  Data integrity issues are analyzed to improve record matching algorithms and 
systemic data integrity.  Operational support includes providing validated, probable in-country 
overstay records to ICE for further investigative follow-up and providing CBP, Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (CIS) and consular officers with notifications of out-of-country overstays. 
The value of this benefit is estimated based on the improvement in matching of entries to exits, 
annual DIG workload measured in number of cases, the time spent analyzing non-matching 
records, and the fully burdened pay rate for DIG analysts.   
The number of entries successfully matched to exits is expected to increase from 88.1%, which 
currently results in 11.9% of records referred to DIG for additional processing, to 97%.  Under the 
solution, the number of successfully matched records is assumed to increase to 97%, resulting in 
3% of records referred to DIG, a roughly 75% reduction in DIG workload from 11.9%.35  The 
baseline DIG workload is estimated at 371,093 for FY 2006.36  At 30 minutes of processing time 
per record,37 the 371,093 annual records require 185,547 labor hours.  With the estimated 
reduction of 75%, due to the improvement in record matching due to the exit solution, annual 
labor hours are reduced by approximately 139,160.  At an average loaded hourly rate of $43.00, 
the cost savings from this benefit is estimated at $6M annually.  This volume is assumed to grow 
annually at a 4% rate, the estimated growth in alien travel.  
Improved ICE Efficiency Attempting Apprehension   
The better accuracy of departure records collected with biometrics compared to the biographical 
data from I-94s provides ICE investigators the knowledge of whether a fugitive or targeted 
individual can be apprehended in the U.S. This accuracy is measured by the value associated with 
the reduction of time spent seeking suspects who are no longer in the country. This benefit is 
calculated based on the annual number of ICE cases, the amount of time ICE agents work on a case 
before classifying it as unresolved, the current ability to accurately match entries to exits, and the 
estimated improved ability to match entries to exit under the biometric exit solution.  It is

RIA

estimated that the baseline ICE overstayer apprehension workload is 13,890 cases annually.38  In 
the current state, it is estimated that 11.9% of records are not matched, whereas under the 
biometric exit solution, this number is expected to fall to 3%.39  Assuming an even probability of 
ICE cases along the distribution of recording matching, there would be 1,653 unresolved cases in 
the current state.40  Under the Exit solution, this number would be reduced to 417.41  Therefore 
improvement in status tracking under the solution reduces the ice unresolved caseloads by 1,236 
annually.   
DHS estimates that ICE agents spend 35 hours pursuing a case before designating it as 
unresolved.42  When multiplied by the reduction in unresolved cases, 1,236, this results in a 
reduction in workload hours on unresolved cases of approximately 43,260 hours annually.  Using 
a fully burdened, average hourly wage of $41.0943 for an ICE agent, this results in an annual 
benefit of $1.8M. This volume is assumed to grow annually at a 4% rate, the estimated growth in 
alien travel. 
As a result of the implementation of Exit, ICE will have information on aliens overstaying their 
visas in a more timely manner than through the current I-94 system. In addition, the electronic 
based biometric based Exit system (as opposed to the paper based I-94) will enable ICE to obtain a 
better picture of characteristics of visa overstayers (i.e., geographic location, nationality, etc.) in 
that shorter time frame. This information has the potential to assist ICE in increasing its efficiency 
with respect to resource allocation as it pertains to apprehending visa overstayers.  
Subject matter experts from ICE’s Investigation Staff were asked to opine regarding the value of 
this information. The values assignable values were “none”, “low”, “medium” and “high”. 
According to the ICE subject matters, neither the proposed rule nor the other alternatives are 
expected to provide any benefits related to improved data to ICE in their investigations efforts. The

Increase in economic activity created through the expansion in the number of Visa Waiver 
Program (VWP) eligible countries  
Implementation of a Biometric Exit Program is required before any new countries may be 
admitted to the VWP.  However, another rule would have to be implemented to cause the specific 
admittance of any new VWP country.  As such, this RIA measures the value of an expanded VWP 
which is predicated on the Biometric Exit Program, but does not include those benefits in the 
aggregated present value of total benefits. 
The value of an expanded VWP is calculated by estimating increased economic activity in the U.S. 
engendered through the increased number of travelers arriving from countries with relaxed visa 
requirements. US-VISIT, of which Exit is an essential program, allows for better tracking of entry 
and exits, one of the criteria of becoming a VWP.  Exit does not claim these benefits as a direct 
result in implementation of, but these benefits are presented to provide the implications of Exit.  
This value is calculated from the estimated growth of travel expected with eased visa requirements 
from the potential VWP countries’ travelers.  This rate of increase in baseline travel, due to 
transitioning from non-VWP to VWP is estimated at 68%.46  This is applied to the baseline travel 
from 12 countries with the potential to be classified as VWP countries in the coming years.  This 
volume of travelers to the US from these countries is estimated at 2.1 million in 2005.47  A 68% 
increase in this baseline volume results in an additional 1,428,000 trips annually.  It is estimated 
that the average spending per visitor is $1,274 in year 2000 dollars.48  Inflated to 2008 dollars 
this value is $1,562.49  Applying this value to the total number of additional annual trips due to 
                                               
45 Alternative 4 was not assessed in the November 1 meeting, however, it is assumed to have the same data 
improvement characteristics as the Counter Solution.

VWP inclusion, 1,428,000, results in an annual benefit of $2.2 billion.  This value is assumed to 
grow by 4% annually.50   
 
Improved compliance with NSEERS requirements due to the improvement in ease of 
compliance  
Replacing the departure requirements under NSEERS with the requirements under Exit will 
improve the compliance rates of NSEERS since all out-bound alien travelers must be processed 
through Exit in order to depart the U.S. from air and sea ports.  The ease of access to biometric 
information collection systems under Exit compared to the person-to-person processing under 
NSEERS will also result in more individuals willing to comply with NSEERS.  Currently NSEERS 
registers exits at 25 selected POEs, the proposed rule Exit solution will be located in at least 73 in-
scope airports.  Given the significantly more widespread presence of the Exit solution, it is 
anticipated that NSEERS exit registration compliance will improve.  
  
Improvement in National Security  
US-VISIT handles a large workload, offers diverse services, and provides timely responses to all of 
its stakeholders. US-VISIT improves capabilities to manage and screen against watch list records, 
which include terrorists, wanted persons and immigration violators.  Together, these measures 
strengthen national security, foster government collaboration, and meet user needs. 
The principal reason for implementation of an Air/Sea Biometric Exit Program is the need to 
ascertain with greater certainty the identity of those aliens departing the United States and whether 
those aliens who have entered for limited times and purposes have, in fact, left the United States in 
accordance with the terms of their admission.  DHS must have a precise understanding of which 
aliens have left the United States, based on more reliable identity information, in order to better 
assess the nature or likelihood of a domestic terrorist threat posed by any given alien and to better 
allocate interior immigration enforcement resources to enforce the immigration laws of the 
United States.   
The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission) 
investigated the events leading up to the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 
2001.51  The 9/11 Commission’s final report illustrates the shortcomings of a system without exit 
controls, showing that several of the 9/11 hijackers (Mohamed Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Satam Suqami, 
Salam al Suqami, and Nawaf al Hazmi) could have been denied admission for having previously

al Hazmi overstayed their visas, the system Congress envisaged did not exist.  Moreover, when 
federal law enforcement authorities realized in late August 2001 that [Khalid al] Mihdhar had 
entered with Hazmi in January 2000 in Los Angeles, they could not reliably determine whether or 
not Hazmi was still in the United States, along with Mihdhar.”  
The 9/11 Commission Report emphasizes the importance of screening aliens traveling to and 
from the United States.  The 9/11 Commission recommended that “[t]argeting travel is at least as 
powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money.  The United States should combine 
terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to intercept terrorists, 
find terrorist travel facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility.”53  It also recommended that the 
United States’ “border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening 
points that includes our transportation system….”54  The 9/11 Commission Report called for the 
implementation of a biometric screening system and specifically referred to the implementation of 
US-VISIT among the 9/11 Commission’s many recommendations for strengthening the ability of 
the United States to detect and deter terrorist attacks on the United States.  The 9/11 Commission 
Report also emphasized the need to make US-VISIT fully operational as soon as possible and that 
the then-present timetable “may be too slow, given the possible security dangers.”   The need for 
better tools and information to assess the continuing terrorist threat is further exemplified by 
recent attempted and consummated terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom, including at airports.  
Avowed threats by Al Qaeda and its affiliates to strike inside the United States are frequently 
renewed. 
This RIA does not attempt to monetize the value to national security of a biometric exit system due 
to the inherent difficulties involved. Instead, a qualitative value is assigned to each alternative that 
varies from “none” (no benefit to national security from the relevant alternative) to “high” with 
intermediate values of “low” and “medium”. The qualitative benefits for each alternative were 
derived from a consensus of subject matter experts from US-VISIT (Project Management Branch 
and other branch staff), Data Integrity Group (DIG) staff and ICE investigation staff.55 The 
consensus arrived at by the subject matter experts was that the proposed rule, as well as the 
Alternatives 2 and 3, provide a “medium” level of benefits related to national security.  Alternative 
1, the Counter Solution, provides a “low” level of benefit, due to the lower confirmation of 
departure after biometric collection.

6 RIA Outcomes 
This section describes the comparative analysis of estimated costs and benefits by alternative. The 
goal of this chapter is to provide decision makers with quantitative, monetized estimations of 
investment costs, net social costs, and benefits of the Proposed Rule and the assessed alternatives. 
This section also discusses the risk evaluation and sensitivities to a few key variables. 
6.1 RIA Outcomes Introduction 
Alternatives were assessed on qualitative and quantitative grounds. The next section describes the 
outcomes of the quantitative analysis, while the following section discusses some of the qualitative 
aspects of the alternatives. 
6.1.1 Key Monetized Benefits Assumptions 
A significant number of estimates and assumptions are made to develop monetized benefits 
estimations. For a full list and detailed description of these, Appendix B should be consulted. Some 
key assumptions include: 
An analysis time horizon of 20 years; 
An assumed rate of travel volume growth of 3% - 5%; 
Two assessed discount rates of 7% and 3%; 
Estimated daily transaction volumes (see Appendix B); and 
Ramp-up based on planned deployment expenditures. 
6.1.2 Monetized Outcomes 
Monetized outcomes were estimated for all impacts that met two conditions: (1) volume estimates 
were available or could be estimated; and (2) values of unit changes in outcomes could be 
determined or estimated using analogous experience, available statistics, or with acceptable 
shadow pricing techniques. Impacts meeting these conditions included: 
• Improved detection of aliens overstaying visas 
• Improved  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement efficiency attempting apprehension of 
overstays 
• Improved efficiency processing Exit/Entry data 
• Direct expenditures to develop, deploy, operate and maintain the solution 
• Social costs resulting from increased traveler queue and processing time

Date: 04-17-2008           79  
• Social costs resulting from increased flight delays 
Once impacts were verified and data required for estimating the scale of impacts was collected, a 
time frame and a ramp-up period of accrual was established. The time frame for the estimation of 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit monetized impacts is set at 20 years, which includes a ramp-up period 
through FY 2009. Ramp-up is determined by the deployment expenditure schedule.  
The estimated costs and benefits by alternative were also assessed.  Where economic impacts were 
calculated to be negative, they were added to the estimated expenditures to calculate estimated 
total social costs. 
The following table describes the outcome of the enterprise-wide estimation of costs and benefits 
by alternative.  The table provides a comparison of costs, benefits and net present values (NPV), at 
a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate, of the proposed rule and the four alternatives at 10 and 20 
year time frames.

Benefits Estimates Probability Based Ranges 
Applying uncertainty to benefit and cost estimates provides a range of probability-based outcomes 
for the expected benefits and costs of the Proposed Rule.  Figures 6-1 through 6-6 below show the 
probability distribution of the Present Value (PV) of monetized benefits and costs for the Proposed 
Rule using 7% and 3% discount rates. The ranges are driven by the uncertainty surrounding the 
estimation assumptions. Initial probability ranges were developed using objective data and either 
reaffirmed or recalculated through an iterative interview process, (i.e., a risk analysis process), 
with US-VISIT subject matter experts to assess the uncertainties underlying the benefit assumptions 
and drivers. Therefore, the figures illustrate the spectrum of potential outcomes given the RIA 
model input.  
For example, the results of the uncertainty analysis indicate that, using a 7% discount rate, there is 
a 80% probability that the 20 year cost of implementation will be between $3.3 billion and $5.3 
billion and that monetized benefits will be between $772 million and $2.1 billion.

6.1.3 Qualitative and Non-monetized Outcomes 
Please see Section 5.3.2 for a summary of the results of the qualitative analysis.   
6.2 Sensitivity Analysis 
In addition to the uncertainty analyses conducted to estimate probability ranges of outcomes, 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to isolate the impact of a set of key variables.  
OMB Circular A-4 provides the following guidance with respect to the conduct of sensitivity 
analyses: 
Use a numerical sensitivity analysis to examine how the results of your analysis vary with 
plausible changes in assumptions, choices of input data, and alternative analytical 
approaches. Sensitivity analysis is especially valuable when the information is lacking to 
carry out a formal probabilistic simulation. Sensitivity analysis can be used to find “switch 
points” -- critical parameter values at which estimated net benefits change sign or the low 
cost alternative switches. Sensitivity analysis usually proceeds by changing one variable or 
assumption at a time, but it can also be done by varying a combination of variables 
simultaneously to learn more about the robustness of your results to widespread changes. 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

Given the OMB guidance, sensitivities tested include the following: 
• Increasing costs from the risk adjusted expenditures to 110% of risk adjusted 
expenditures 
• Decreasing the investment lifecycle from 20 years to 10 years 
• Increasing the travel volumes from 4% to 5% 
• Increase in traveler delayed (queue and processing time) to the upper bound 
• Sensitivity to airline collaboration and cost-sharing in the development of a solution.57 
The outcomes of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the travel growth assumption has a more 
significant impact to the analysis than the delay assumptions.  Only the potential for a major 
increase in costs has a bigger impact to the outcome.

57 This scenario examines the possibility of collaboration among individual airlines in the development of an 
integrated solution as opposed to each airline developing proprietary systems.  The motivation behind such an action 
among industry competitors is that collaboration could lead to lower individual costs per airline.  The analysis assumes 
lower costs for equipment and implementation for the carrier alternatives and is not applicable to the government 
alternatives.

6.3 Break-Even Analysis 
This “Breakeven Analysis” examines the implementation of the Proposed Rule (location at carrier’s 
discretion with airline/sea carrier being responsible for implementation and management) and the 
degree by which its implementation must reduce risk of terrorist attack in order to be justified at a 
“breakeven point”.  The period examined is from 2008-2017 and three scenarios are examined 
with respect to terrorist attack. The first involves an attack involving only human casualties, the 
second human casualties and the loss of a commercial airliner and the third a catastrophic loss 
along the lines of the Twin Towers Attack of September 11, 2001. The present value of each 
scenario’s benefits and costs are examined using two discount rates, 3% and 7%. The analysis also 
utilizes three estimates of the Proposed Rule’s costs, a high, medium and low.  
Ideally, the quantification and monetization of the beneficial security effects of this regulation 
would involve two steps. First, we would estimate the reduction in the probability of a successful 
terrorist attack resulting from implementation of the regulation and the consequences of the 
avoided event (collectively, the risk associated with a potential terrorist attack). Then we would 
identify individuals’ willingness to pay for this incremental risk reduction and multiply it by the 
population experiencing the benefit. Both of these steps, however, rely on key data that are not 
available for this rule. 
Typically, reductions in the probability of a terrorist attack resulting from a regulation are 
measured against the baseline probability of occurrence (the current likelihood that a terrorist 
attack will be attempted and be successful) and combined with information about the 
consequences of the attack. The difference between the baseline probability of occurrence and the 
probability of occurrence after the regulation is implemented would represent the incremental 
probability reduction attributable to the rule. 
We cannot use historical data on the frequency of terrorist attacks to estimate the current baseline 
probability of attack within the United States for several reasons. The data on international events 
occurring within the United States in the last decade are limited, and little information is available 
describing the consequences of most of these events. Additionally, use of these data to project 
future probability of attack requires an understanding of the socioeconomic and political 
conditions motivating and facilitating these events historically and foresight with regard to how 
these factors may change in the future. Therefore, for the primary benefits analysis, we do not use 
these data to estimate the baseline probability of a terrorist attack in the United States or the 
reduction resulting from improved tracking of Alien exits via the Air/Sea Biometric Exit program.

As a result, and in the absence of more detailed data, we are unable to quantitatively estimate the 
incremental reduction in the probability of terrorist attack that will result from this rule. 
We have conducted reviews of the economic literature to identify existing studies of individuals’ 
willingness to pay to reduce the risk of a terrorist attack. Several articles discuss characteristics of 
terrorist attacks that might influence willingness to pay to reduce these risks.58 Given publicly 
available data, however, we are unable to identify specific estimates of willingness to pay to 
reduce the risk of terrorist attack in the United States. Although we are unable to identify estimates 
of willingness to pay for the risk reductions potentially achieved by this regulation, academic 
literature provides information about how the public’s perception of terrorist risks might 
influence their desire for policy action, and ultimately, their willingness to pay for such 
regulation. A substantial body of psychometric literature attempts to measure how the perception 
of risk affects attitudes towards risk reduction. 
For example, the work of Slovic et al., clarifies dimensions of risk that influence individual 
rankings of the importance of reducing these risks.59 The authors find that the most important 
determinant of how the public ranks risk is the degree of “dread” associated with the risk. The 
authors define dreaded risks as a “perceived lack of control...catastrophic potential, fatal 
consequences, and the inequitable distribution of risks and benefits.”60 In other words, the public 
is less willing to tolerate risks related to incidents they dread, such as nuclear accidents or terrorist 
attacks, than incidents that are not dreaded but that pose similar or higher risks, such as riding a 
motorcycle. Slovic et al., state that the more dreaded an activity, “(a) the higher its perceived risk, 
(b) the more people want its risk reduced, and (c) the more they want to see strict regulation 
employed to achieve the desired reduction in risk.”61 Based on existing risk perception literature, 
it is reasonable to hypothesize that people would be willing to pay more to reduce risks associated 
with a terrorist attack than similar risks associated with hazards that are familiar, controllable, and 
that do not have catastrophic consequences. 
When it is not possible to obtain a single value estimate that comprises the bundle of benefits 
derived from the regulation in question, analysts estimate separately the value of individual effects 
resulting from the regulation and sum them to estimate total benefits. Certain effects are more

easily measured than others. Substantial literature exists estimating the value of changes in fatal 
and nonfatal risks. In addition, the value of lost property and opportunity costs associated with 
supply chain effects can be determined from market data. Other effects may be more difficult to 
quantify or monetize—a regulatory action may result in citizens feeling safer or having less fear. 
Several researchers argue that reductions in fear result in a social good that should be quantified, 
though “the problem of quantifying and monetizing fear and its consequences…has yet to be 
seriously engaged in the relevant literature.”62 In addition, people’s willingness to pay to protect 
national historic treasures or sites of cultural importance may exceed the costs of simply repairing 
or rebuilding these sites. Effects that are not easily monetized using readily available information 
may be discussed qualitatively. However, lacking information about the incremental decrease in 
the probability of a successful terrorist attack or reliable information about the consequences of 
such an attack, we are unable to quantify individual categories of benefits. Without quantifying 
these benefits, we cannot estimate their value. 
In light of these limitations, we conduct a “breakeven” analysis to determine what change in the 
reduction of risk would be necessary in order for the benefits of the rule to exceed the costs. OMB 
recommends a threshold or breakeven analysis when nonquantified benefits are important to 
evaluating the benefits of a regulation.63 The potential economic impacts of a terrorist attack that 
are prevented by the regulation represent the costs savings, or benefits, of the regulation. For the 
costs and benefits of the rule to be equal, the net costs of the rule we are able to monetize in the 
analysis must equal the reduction in the probability that a successful terrorist attack will occur 
multiplied by the costs of such an attack, as illustrated in the following formula— 
Net costs = p (successful terrorist attack) × consequences of an attack 
We solve for the change in probability (p), and the result is the smallest reduction in the 
probability of a successful terrorist attack resulting from the regulation that would result in the 
benefits of the rule equaling the costs. We believe that in the absence of a credible estimate of the 
probability of a terrorist attack, this “breakeven” probability can still be of much use to decision 
makers and the general public. For example, if decision makers believe that the incremental 
change in probability of a successful attack achievable with the rule is greater than the change 
calculated in our analysis, this may lead them to recommend adopting the regulation on the 
grounds that a reasonable estimate of the benefits of the rule is likely to exceed a reasonable 
estimate of the costs. Conversely, if decision makers believe the incremental change in probability 
is likely to be less than the change calculated in this analysis, this may lead them to recommend 
rejecting the regulation on the grounds that the costs of the rule are likely to exceed the benefits. 
An important caveat is that this analysis is only useful if the attack scenarios appropriately reflect 
the types of attacks prevented by this regulation. 
The accounting statement that provides the relevant data used for the breakeven analysis can be 
seen in the below table. The table’s figures are the same as presented elsewhere in this report as

The Proposed Rule is assumed to reduce the ability of terrorists to conduct attacks against the U.S. 
through its ability to provide, to CBP and other law enforcement agencies, information on visa 
overstayers who are considered high risk who may have slipped into the U.S., via legitimate and 
legal entry means, without having originally being detected as such but later being identified as 
high risk (i.e., after having entered into the U.S.). It is assumed that Exit, by providing 
information to CBP and other relevant parties as to whether or not high risk individuals have left 
the U.S., enables them to better concentrate their resources on those high risk individuals still in 
the U.S. This would be expected to assist in the apprehension of such individuals quicker than 
would otherwise be the case hence reducing their ability to carry out terrorist acts in the U.S. 
As stated earlier, three terrorist scenarios are examined. The first only involves human casualties 
and no significant property damage. An example of such an attack may be a chemical or biological 
attack on a major metropolitan area that causes little, if any, damage to buildings or other types of 
infrastructure. As it is not possible to infer the number of fatalities that such an attack can cause, a 
range of human casualties is assumed, from 500 to 3,000. Economic values for within this range 
are calculated and presented using two assumptions with respect to the value of statistical life 
(VSL). The first assumption assumes, in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration 
guidance, that the estimated value of statistical life (VSL) is $3 million per person (in 2004 dollar 
terms).64 The second VSL used is $6 million per person (in 2004 dollar terms).65 This is the value 
that the Environmental Protection Agency uses.66

The second terrorist attack scenario makes the same assumptions regarding human casualties but 
also assumes, over and above those, that a large commercial airliner is lost and includes the cost of 
conducting an FAA investigation of the incident. According to the FAA, the average cost of a 
commercial passenger airliner, in 2004 dollar terms, was $11.5 MN.67 Converted to 2008 dollar 
terms, this comes to $13.6 MN. The FAA has estimated the cost of a typical investigation at 
$400,000 (in 2004 dollar terms).68  
The last terrorist attack scenario, the “Catastrophic Loss” category, assumes an attack along the 
lines of the Attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001. As exact human losses cannot be 
reasonably estimated, a range of fatalities is assumed between 500 and 3,000. In addition it is also 
assumed that physical damage and foregone business income is equal to that estimated for the 
New York City September 11th attacks. These costs were estimated, by the Comptroller of the City 
of New York, to be $21.8 BN (in 2004 dollars).69 In 2008 dollar terms this translates to $25.8 
BN. The costs of a loss of a commercial airliner and associated FAA investigation have not been 
included. 
The results from the derived analysis for the three scenarios, using 7% and 3% discount rates, can 
be seen in the six tables on the following pages. A number of facts can be derived from these 
tables. The first is that in the human only and human plus plane scenarios, in those with 500 
casualties, significant reductions in risk are needed to justify the expenditures on the Air/Sea Exit 
program, at least from the perspective of fighting terrorism. In the high cost scenarios for 500 
casualty events for example, risk must be reduced by about 20%. 
For cases where there are more casualties, for example the human only and human plus plane 
scenarios for casualties in the range of 1,000 to 3,000, due to the relatively lower implementation 
cost to benefit ratios, even small improvements in risk reduction can justify the implementation of 
project. In the aforementioned scenarios, even a risk reduction of 1% to 8% justifies 
implementation of the Air/Sea Exit program. In the scenarios involving catastrophic loss, again 
due to relatively high benefits to cost ratio, only a less-than-1% to 1% reduction in terrorist attack 
would justify implementation.   
The full set of calculated risks, for each scenario and using 7% and 3% discount rates, can be seen 
in the tables below.

7 Analysis Framework 
The process for conducting the analysis and developing the content of this RIA is based on a 
framework issued by DHS and in conformance with OMB Circular A-4. The RIA framework is 
based on best practices outlined in the Department of Homeland Security CBA Workbook and 
advanced by the General Accounting Office, and satisfies the following goals: Transparency & 
Audit Trail, Credibility, and Risk Analysis, Establishment of Measurable/Quantifiable Outcomes, 
and Continuous Updating. This section describes how the framework was applied to the Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit RIA work effort. 
7.1 RIA Framework Process 
At its core, the RIA framework is a methodology for identifying solution benefits and performance 
metrics, estimating solution costs, and projecting estimated solution value. 
The RIA framework process involves four steps: 
1. Scope Input – This step entails working with business and IT stakeholders to understand the 
design and functionality of the investment, including the functional and technical 
components of each viable alternative. 
2. Benefits Estimation – The estimation of benefits involves two components. To estimate the 
effects and effectiveness of each solution70, sources of benefits and value creation for each 
technical component of each viable alternative are ascertained and the identified benefits are 
linked to the goals and objectives of Air/Sea Biometric Exit stakeholders. To estimate the 
value of those effects, or benefits, structure and logic diagrams are developed to show how 
benefits are estimated and data to calculate benefits is obtained (where possible). 
3. Cost Estimation – In this step, all sources of capital and operations and maintenance costs are 
identified via bottoms-up estimates using the best data available. 
4. Outcomes and Risks – This step involves quantifying benefits and lifecycle costs, projected 
outcomes and risk-adjusted present values of costs and benefits. It also includes two types of 
risk analysis. With analytical risk analysis, benefits and costs are adjusted for uncertainty as 
part of the RIA framework process. The adjustment indicates the level of uncertainty subject 
matter experts place on estimated benefits or costs, and is expressed in terms of a range and 
explained with assumptions. With managerial risk, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by 
which higher-level and uncontrollable external risks are identified and, where possible, 
quantified.  
                                               
70 This framework addresses a general approach.  For Air/Sea Biometric Exit, there are no differences in benefits across 
the Proposed Rule and alternatives.

7.1.1 Scope Input 
The remaining sections of this chapter explain how the team applied this methodology to the 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit RIA. 
In every RIA, this stage is critical because all analysis starts with understanding the scope of 
alternatives being considered. The RIS team facilitated this process, working with business and IT 
subject matter experts to document the scope of each alternative and develop assumptions where 
scope decisions have not been finalized.  
The scoping process required defining the Air/Sea Exit alternatives to a sufficient level of detail to 
allow for in-depth analysis. The alternatives were grouped into meaningful business capabilities 
based on meeting specific criteria, shown below: 
• The alternative should meet the goals and objectives set for the desired capability; 
• The alternative should be reasonably feasible from various perspectives (e.g., 
technologically, financially, politically); 
• The alternative should be reasonably different from other alternatives (the alternative 
should not be a different configuration of another alternative); and 
• The alternative can be reasonably assessed against a base case. 
For detailed information regarding the alternative selection process and the breadth of alternatives 
analyzed during the selection process refer to Appendix G.  
7.1.2 Benefits Estimation 
Benefits estimation refers to determining the effects of the alternatives and how those effects relate 
to the baseline, or the situation by which no investments will be made. Since effects can stem from 
multiple aspects of the solution and can affect several performance metrics, structure and logic 
diagrams were developed to show the logic behind the calculation of the benefits. To “populate” 
that logic, the RIA team worked with stakeholder organizations to develop a list of benefits and 
metrics, quantify the anticipated changes to those metrics based on the new solutions, and, using 
monetization source values (such as the value of time, or of processing costs avoided), to 
ultimately determine the economic impacts of each alternative. 
Two additional categories of benefits were considered and covered in this RIA: quantifiable 
benefits that could not be monetized and non-quantifiable benefits. In both cases, a lack of data 
was typically the cause for not being able to monetize the benefits. Some of these benefits reflect 
potential impacts to society, for which values are not directly observable but for which monetary 
values can be constructed and ascribed based on closely related observed prices (such as wage rates 
for the opportunity cost of time). Where applicable, this technique was employed to facilitate the 
measurement of certain societal benefits. This completes the “benefits picture” for Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit.

Effects 
This phase of the estimation process consisted of four steps: 
1. The development of benefits categories—detection, efficiency and other benefits—
which correspond to the high level goals of DHS but also apply to all stakeholders. 
2. Developing benefits components that would be evaluated side-by-side with the 
technical components of the alternatives under consideration. This allows a 
determination to be made about which benefits are likely for each alternative and from 
what source they stem.71  
3. The identification of metrics within each benefit component (where possible).  
4. The creation of structure and logic diagrams for each identified benefit metric. These 
diagrams facilitated the consensus building process by allowing technical experts and 
other stakeholders to evaluate benefits metrics without having to wade through 
complicated formulas. A sample structure and logic diagram is shown below.

Value of Effects (Benefits) 
The value of effects refers to the monetizing impacts of benefits. Values were calculated by 
multiplying the effects by the monetary value of an event, such as the monetary value of 
preventing a prior visa overstay from entering the U.S. who should have been denied, by the 
projected volume of that event. That yielded a monetized benefit that could be evaluated against 
the base case value. 
As mentioned earlier, some benefits reflect potential impacts to society, for which values are not 
directly observable but for which monetary values can be constructed and ascribed based on 
closely related observed prices (such as wage rates for the opportunity cost of time). Where 
applicable, this technique was employed to facilitate the measurement of certain societal benefits.  
7.1.3 Cost Estimation 
Costs, like benefits, stem directly from the scope of the alternatives provided by business and IT 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit stakeholders. Those same subject matter experts were consulted to itemize 
costs at the most elemental unit possible, namely prices and quantities, and to define cost factors, 
such as the average amount of space required to house a server. To adjust those costs for the risk 
that actual costs would differ, prices and quantities were represented by ranges reflecting their 
likely values, rather than a rigid one-number estimate.  
As part of cost estimation, both costs and cost efficiencies were considered and summed to yield 
net incremental costs. Examples of cost efficiencies/avoidance include increases in productivity 
and the eliminated costs that occur when a piece of hardware is retired.  
As with benefits, potential societal costs will be evaluated with the use of proxies for the value of 
some goods, such as time, for which direct prices cannot be observed. Capturing as many societal 
impacts as possible will provide a more comprehensive estimate of the net impact of the program. 
Capital Costs/O&M Costs 
A cost model was used to capture cost inputs. In terms of capital costs, the following categories 
were used: labor (contractor and government), hardware (e.g., servers, scanners, and matchers), 
software (e.g., matching software), and facilities (e.g., power upgrades, space for servers). Costs 
in each category were assigned to system development lifecycle phases. Operations and 
maintenance costs were also captured as part of this process. For a detailed description of cost 
assumptions, see Section 4.4 and Appendix A. 
7.1.4 RIA Outcomes/Risk Analysis 
Economic forecasts traditionally take the form of a single “expected outcome” supplemented with 
alternative scenarios. The limitation of a forecast with a single expected outcome is clear: while it 
may provide the single best statistical estimate, it offers no information about the range of other 
possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. The problem becomes acute when 
uncertainty surrounding the forecast’s underlying assumptions is material. 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008           102  
A common approach is to create “high case” and “low case” scenarios to bracket the central 
estimate. This scenario approach can exacerbate the problem of dealing with uncertainty because it 
gives no indication of likelihood associated with the alternative outcomes. The commonly 
reported “high case” may assume that most underlying assumptions deviate in the same direction 
from their expected value, and likewise for the “low case.” In reality, the likelihood that all 
underlying factors shift in the same direction simultaneously may be very remote. 
Another common approach to providing added perspective on reality is “sensitivity analysis.” Key 
forecast assumptions are varied one at a time to assess their relative impact on the expected 
outcome. This is a potentially useful tool in order to identify which assumptions or data are 
driving the outcome of the analysis.  This RIA did incorporate several sensitivity analyses of key 
estimates in addition to analyzing the impact of simultaneous differences between assumptions 
and actual outcomes.  
A more comprehensive uncertainty analysis provides a better picture of the uncertainties inherent 
in an analysis than either the scenario approach or a sensitivity analysis. It helps avoid the lack of 
perspective in “high” and “low” cases by measuring the probability or “odds” that an outcome 
will actually materialize. This is accomplished by attaching ranges (probability distributions) to 
the forecasts of each input variable. The approach allows all inputs to be varied simultaneously 
within their distributions, thus avoiding the problems inherent in conventional sensitivity analysis. 
The approach also recognizes interrelationships between variables and their associated probability 
distributions. This analytical risk approach was taken for this Air/Sea Biometric Exit RIA. 
7.1.5 RIA Principles 
The RIA team applied the following principles to its efforts. 
1. Account for the Base Case. Proposed alternatives were compared to the “as-is,” or “base 
case” process, where “as-is” essentially assumes that no major investments will be 
made. Two cost-benefit tests were considered to increase the credibility of results. The 
first was whether the alternative’s incremental benefits exceeded its costs. The second 
was a comparison of the incremental net benefits of each alternative, where 
“incremental net benefits” meant that the likely effects of a properly conceived Base 
Case are completely taken into account. Using these incremental approaches implicitly 
tests the as-is case in addition to the three proposed alternatives. Had the alternatives 
failed to produce a positive return on investment, an interpretation would have been an 
endorsement of the as-is case. 
2. Account comprehensively for all major alternatives. The cost benefit analysis was 
applied to the widest-possible range of feasible strategic and tactical alternatives.  
3. Account comprehensively for all costs and benefits, while simultaneously avoiding 
double-counting. This principle was applied to this RIA. 
4. Ask, whenever possible, “whether” and “when.” Internal rates of return, net present 
values, and benefit-to-cost ratios were used to indicate whether a particular investment 
alternative is economically justifiable and how it compares to other alternatives. Project 
timing and phasing were also considered.  
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

5. Conduct a valid risk analysis. Every important forecast and assumption will likely be 
wrong to some degree. Therefore, this RIA accounted for two different kinds of risk: 
analytical and managerial. 
6. Develop a transparent cost and benefit measurement tool to facilitate peer reviews, 
audits, and updates. 
7. Provide a “line of sight” that ties program goals to business case outcomes, scope, and 
performance measures.

8 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
Impacts to Small Entities 
This chapter has been prepared to examine the impacts of the final rule on small entities as 
required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 604, as amended by the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act of 1996 or SBREFA). A small entity may be a small 
business (defined as any independently owned and operated business not dominant in its field that 
qualifies as a small business per the Small Business Act); a small not-for-profit organization; or a 
small governmental jurisdiction (locality with fewer than 50,000 people). 
In this rulemaking, small air carriers are defined as those that employ fewer than 1,500 
employees, and small sea carriers are defined as those that employ fewer than 500 employees. As 
noted previously, these carriers are exempt from collecting biometric information for US-VISIT 
exit requirements under this Proposed Rule. Based on information obtained from CBP regarding 
current eAPIS users, this analysis estimates that there are approximately 500 small U.S. air carriers 
that could be affected by the Proposed Rule were it not for the proposed exemption. There are an 
estimated 3 small U.S. sea passenger carriers that would be affected. The analysis of the potential 
number of air and sea carriers that would be directly affected by the Proposed Rule were it not for 
the small carrier exemption is ongoing. Public comment on the population estimates is requested.   
Additionally, costs to airports owned by small governmental jurisdictions must be considered. US-
VISIT estimates that 73 international airports are likely to be directly affected by this Proposed 
Rule. These airports host primarily the large carriers that will be required to comply with the 
Proposed Rule. In addition to these 73 airports, there are an additional 48 smaller airports that 
could be affected by this Proposed Rule because they have a small number of international flights. 
However, US-VISIT does not believe that these airports will be affected because they host primarily 
chartered international flights by small carriers, which are exempt from the Proposed Rule. Finally, 
US-VISIT estimates that 33 seaports are likely to be directly affected by this Proposed Rule. 
This section addresses: 
♦ The reason the agency is considering this action 
♦ The objectives of and legal basis for the rule 
♦ The number and types of small entities to which the rule will apply 
♦ Projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule, including 
the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirements and the type of professional 
skills necessary for the preparation of the reports and records 
♦ Other relevant Federal rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the rule

♦ Significant alternatives to the component under consideration that accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and may minimize any significant economic impact of the rule 
on small entities 
Reason for Agency Action 
The Department of Homeland Security proposes to implement the Secure Travel and 
Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007, which directed the Department to establish a system, 
by August 3, 2008, to collect and record biometric identifying information from every alien 
participating in the Visa Waiver Program departing the United States by air and compare such 
information against terrorist watch lists and available immigration information, and to implement 
other programmatic and law enforcement authorities. This Proposed Rule would amend existing 
US-VISIT requirements to establish an exit program at certain air and seaports of departure in the 
United States. The Proposed Rule would also require that persons subject to US-VISIT biometric 
requirements upon entering the United States provide biometric identifiers prior to departing the 
United States from air or sea ports of departure. Finally, the Proposed Rule would require that air 
and vessel carriers collect and transmit to the Department of Homeland Security the biometric 
information from applicable passengers and crew members in tandem with the collection of 
passenger manifest information collected under existing and planned authorities and procedures. 
Objectives of and Legal Basis for the Rule 
The principal reason for this rulemaking is the need to ascertain with greater certainty the identity 
of those aliens departing the United States and whether those aliens who have entered for limited 
times and purposes have, in fact, left the country in accordance with the terms of their admission. 
DHS must have a precise understanding of which aliens have left the United States, based on more 
reliable identity information, in order to better assess the nature or likelihood of a domestic 
terrorist threat posed by any given individual and to better allocate interior immigration 
enforcement resources to enforce the immigration laws of the United States. More information on 
the objectives of the rule can be found in the preamble to the Proposed Rule. 
The legal basis for the rule can also be found in the preamble to the Proposed Rule. 
Number and Types of Small Entities to which the Rule Will Apply 
As noted previously, US-VISIT is proposing to exempt small air and sea carriers that are considered 
small by the definitions set forth by the Small Business Administration. For air carriers [NAICS 
codes 481111 (Scheduled Passenger Air Transportation) and 481211 (Nonscheduled Chartered 
Passenger Air Transportation)], the small business threshold is 1,500 employees. For sea carriers 
[(NAICS code 483112 (Deep Sea Passenger Transportation)], the small business threshold is 500 
employees. 
The number of exempted small carriers is not known with certainty. Thousands of entities are 
registered to use CBP’s eAPIS, a web-based, no-fee transmission system that is used to transmit 
APIS data to CBP prior to an aircraft’s departure. eAPIS users include not only small air passenger 
carriers but also large air passenger carriers, air ambulance providers, aircraft leasing companies, 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

flight instruction schools, large and small air cargo carriers, large and small sea passenger carriers, 
large and small sea cargo carriers, and several bus and truck operators.72 CBP reviewed the eAPIS 
users (as of February 2007), and based on a representative sample of this database estimates that 
approximately 500 small air carriers would be affected by the proposed US-VISIT exit 
requirements were it not for the exemptions set forth in the rule.73 Additionally, CBP identified 3 
small sea passenger carriers that would be affected. 
Additionally, some airports and seaports will need to work with the large carriers to make 
modifications to accommodate the US-VISIT exit process. As presented previously in the primary 
cost-benefit analysis, US-VISIT identified 73 airports and 33 seaports where significant 
modifications would need to be made due to the large number of in-scope international 
passengers that these airports host. Additionally, US-VISIT identified 40 airports that service 
international passengers but because of the exemptions proposed are unlikely to be affected, as 
they host small air carriers. 
Of the 73 airports included in the primary cost-benefit analysis, 23 are owned by a city, 17 are 
owned by a local airport authority, 15 are owned by a county, 11 are owned by a port authority, 
and 7 are owned by a state or U.S. territory. Of those airports owned by cities, none are owned by 
small jurisdictions. In other words, these cities all have a population of at least 50,000 people 
based on 2006 Census data.74 Of those airports owned by counties, none are owned by small 
jurisdictions. None of the airport authorities or port authorities, usually quasi-government 
organizations at the local, regional, or state level, serves a small jurisdiction. The one privately 
owned airport (in Kenmore, WA), is a small business based on the threshold for airport services75 
because it earns revenues of less than $6.5 million annually. Of the 33 seaports included in the 
primary cost-benefit analysis, all are owned by a port authority serving a large jurisdiction or by a 
state. 
The 73 airports and 33 seaports included in the cost-benefit analysis are presented below.

Again, US-VISIT does not believe that these smaller airports will be directly affected by the rule 
because they will not host carriers that must comply with US-VISIT exit requirements. However, 
US-VISIT is seeking comment on that assumption. 
Based on this analysis, DHS does not believe the rule would have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. DHS requests public comments on that assumption.  
Commenters should note that the individual aliens to whom this rule applies are not considered 
small entities as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6), and indirect economic impacts are not 
considered within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.76  
Reporting and Recordkeeping 
Unless otherwise exempted, this rule requires that air and sea carriers transmit biometric 
information on passengers within the scope of US-VISIT requirements no later than 24 hours after 
the passenger has departed the United States. Further detail can be found elsewhere in the primary 
cost-benefit analysis presented in earlier chapters. 
Other Federal Rules 
This proposed rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other Federal regulations. 
Regulatory Alternatives 
As discussed previously, US-VISIT considered a host of regulatory alternatives. The chosen 
alternative, the Proposed Rule, minimizes the burden to small entities to the extent possible 
because it specifically exempts small air and sea carriers.  
US-VISIT is seeking comments on any of the regulatory requirements that could minimize the 
regulatory burden upon small businesses. Comments may be submitted to the regulatory docket 
using any of the methods listed under ADDRESSES in the preamble to this Proposed Rule. All input 
received during the public comment period will be considered.

Purpose 
This Rough Order of Magnitude cost estimate is designed to support the Air/Sea Exit Solution 
Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM).  The Air/Sea exit solution addresses the United States 
Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program’s plan to implement the 
Proposed Rule, a non-interdiction exit solution.  Previous iterations of this estimate focused on a 
solution where the functionality of Air/Sea Exit would be deployed to the check-in counter area of 
every airport and seaport in the United States, a total of 455 airports and 33 seaports.  This 
estimate focuses on a counter/gate solution, where biometric scanners and related hardware will 
be installed at check-in areas (where necessary) and departure gate areas in all 73 U.S. 
international airports served by medium and large airlines as well as the check-in counter areas at 
seaports that historically have provided sea transportation to international destinations.  The 
individual airlines and sea carriers will be responsible for all acquisition and implementation 
efforts for the exit solution as well as related application development and deployment based on 
guidance and strict data requirements provided to them by US-VISIT.  There are a variety of 
possible alternatives to this solution, based on where in the port the solution is deployed, and 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

whether the government or the carriers implement the solution.  Three of these alternatives are 
addressed in Section A.1.9. 
Scope 
The ROM estimate identifies costs to US-VISIT as well as the airline and sea carrier industries 
associated with the implementation of the Exit solution.  This applies to all U.S. airports handling 
either domestic or international passenger traffic being serviced by medium or large airlines as 
well as seaports that historically have provided transportation to international destinations.   
• Number of Airports – 73 international airports. 
o This is the total number of airports served by medium and large airlines with 
international flights, based on information received from the Official Airline Guide 
(OAG) (http://www.oag.com). 
o Sizes are determined based on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
classifications. 
• Number of Airlines – 80 medium and large airlines that depart for international 
destinations from U.S. airports. 
o This is the total number of airlines with international departures, based on 
information received from the OAG. 
 Small airlines are those with less than 1,500 employees, based on Small 
Business Administration definitions. 
 Medium airlines were determined to be those with more than 1,500 
employees and less than 16,000 employees. 
 Large airlines were assumed to be those with more than 16,000 employees. 
• Number of Seaports – 33. 
• Number of Sea Carriers – 9 sea carriers with international departures. 
 
Limitations 
• This is intended to be a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate only.  Because the formal 
Concept of Operations did not address the specific methodology to be employed to capture 
biometrics, the estimates had to make broad assumptions as to the nature of the proposed 
solutions.  These are outlined in the Assumptions and Basis of Estimate in Section A.1.  To 
reflect the high level of risk in this estimate, the higher bound risk categories, similar to an 
Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE) Class 5 estimate should be 
utilized.  Absent a formal risk assessment, the AACE guidelines call for a -50 percent for the 
lower bound and a +100 percent for the higher bound.  Because the estimate is still 
considered class 5, although approaching class 4, the point estimate should not be viewed 
as the most probable cost; instead, risk adjusted costs should be used for initial planning 
purposes.  
• The burden on the traveler was not computed.  Detailed modeling efforts are underway to 
determine traveler impact, but were not available in time for inclusion in this estimate.  
Likewise, the burden to the airline and sea carrier business processes was not taken into 
account.  The solutions are assumed to integrate directly into the current carrier business 
processes.  Additional staff was assumed in a very limited context (Attendants to provide 
support to biometric collection, and an aggregate of labor hours for the actual collection 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

time).  This labor is discussed in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) section, Section 
A.1.7. 
 
Data Sources 
• Comprehensive Exit Integrated Product Team and other Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) and US-VISIT SMEs. 
• US-VISIT Deploy vs. Airline Deploy Comparison, an independent estimate provided by ITM. 
• US-VISIT, TSA, OAG and FAA websites. 
• Other internet resources including Wikipedia.com to identify airport and seaport 
configurations and airlines and sea carriers. 
 
General Assumptions 
Overall 
• This estimate assumes an investment phase of 15 months (with overlapping effort).  Three 
and three-quarters years of supplemental O&M were added to the end of the investment 
phase, for a total of five years of costs.  Investment costs are presented in Base Year 2008 
dollars (BY08$) unless otherwise noted, while O&M costs are presented in Then Year 
dollars (TY$). 
• At the airports, the solution will be counter-mounted devices at both the check-in counter 
(where necessary) and the departure gate (the gate portion of the solution would be built 
into the counters present in the departure area).  It is assumed that the solution will be 
deployed to departure gates at 80 percent of airports, and to counters at 20 percent of 
airports where the departure gate area is too small and condensed to feasibly accommodate 
the gate solution or if an airline prefers a counter solution for some other reason.  Counters 
may be at either the check-in area or within the sterile area, where available, to 
accommodate travelers connecting from other domestic airports.  The solution assumes 
two devices will be installed at each gate area to allow for redundancy.  Six devices will be 
installed at each counter at large airports, four in medium airports, and two in small 
airports to allow for redundancy and adequate capacity, and for logistical reasons.  At 
seaports, the solution will be installed only at the check-in area.  Six devices will be 
installed at each seaport counter to meet demand, and for logistical reasons.   
• The counter and gate solutions are assumed to be a set of component pieces that combine 
to create the exit solution: 
o Fingerprint scanner 
o PC processor 
o Display screen 
o Document reader  
• While it is possible that there will be collaboration within alliances to help offset some of 
the development costs to the carriers, this collaboration was not factored into the estimate 
at the current time. 
• The airlines and sea carriers lease space from the ports.  As such, all industry-incurred costs 
resulting from the implementation of this solution will be passed on to the carriers.  The 
ports are not expected to incur any costs.

• The Electronic Advance Passenger Information System is not used by the in-scope carriers 
except as a reporting tool.  No modifications to this system are expected to be incurred. 
• Airport size for purpose of this analysis is as defined by the FAA.     
• Small airlines are defined as any that have fewer than 1,500 employees.  These were 
defined as out-of-scope and excluded from this analysis. 
Labor 
Labor rates are estimated based on a total of 1,790 billable hours per year.  This hour estimate is 
based upon a factor provided by TSA that 14 percent of the hours in a year are “pay/no work” 
hours. 
Software Engineering 
As it was assumed that contractors would be performing the IT work for the government portion 
of this effort, labor rates for those cost elements were based on analysis of a GSA labor study 
conducted by Tecolote Research, Inc. in February, 2007.  To determine the labor rates to apply to 
this effort, the most current published GSA IT Schedules were downloaded from IT providers 
supplying similar services to those included in this effort.  Each schedule was obtained from the 
providers’ web site.  The following eight companies were used in the analysis: Booz Allen 
Hamilton, EDS, IBM, Lockheed Martin Mission Systems, Raytheon, SAIC, Technology Planning and 
Management Corporation, and Northrop Grumman.  For purposes of this estimate, software 
engineers were categorized as outlined in Table A-2. 
Table A-2: Software Engineer Classification 
Software 
Engineer Level
Years of 
Experience
1 0 to 1
2 2 to 5
3 6 to 8
4 9 to 11  
Although Software Engineer 5 was not included in this estimate, the data were included to run a 
multiple regression analysis that combined data from 78 published GSA labor rates.  A model was 
built to predict the hourly rate as a linear function of an intercept and 13 explanatory variables.  
The model calculated a median hourly rate for a typical level 3 programmer with zero years of 
experience working for a particular company.  An experience factor was then developed to 
account for each year of experience.  Each of the companies was then ranked according to the 
complexity and consequences of the type of work being performed.  For example, those 
companies engaged in enterprises where the consequences of mistakes could result in catastrophic 
loss, or loss of life, were ranked highest on the list.  An adjustment factor tied to the calculated 
“typical” company was developed for each of the companies.  Because of the complexity of the 
type of work US-VISIT is involved in, and the potential consequences of mistakes (i.e. terrorist 
enters the country), US-VISIT was ranked midway between typical and the highest level.  For 
estimating purposes it was assumed the labor mix for the development effort would be as follows.  
The mix was top weighted to account for the skill level and effort necessary to meet a highly 
compressed development schedule.

Total 122.39$            4,895.76$         21,214.96$         
This composite rate was calculated based on an hourly rate for the contractors in the labor rate 
survey.  To determine the weekly rate, the total hourly rate was multiplied by 40 (hours in a 
week).  To determine the annual labor rate, the weekly rate was multiplied by 52 (weeks in a 
year).  To determine the monthly rate, the annual rate was divided by 12 (months in a year). 
Construction 
Construction labor rates applicable to counter modification efforts were derived from information 
obtained from Salary.com.  Seventy-fifth percentile national average rates were used for level 1 and 
3 carpenters and level 1 and 3 electricians then burdened with average bonuses and benefits to 
derive average national compensation.  This was burdened with overhead, G&A and profit as 
shown in Table A-3.  For estimating purposes it was assumed the labor mix for the construction 
effort would be as follows: 
• Carpenters 
o Level 1 carpenters – 50% 
o Level 2 carpenters – 50% 
• Electricians 
o Level 1 electricians – 50% 
o Level 2 electricians – 50%

This composite monthly rate was the basis for annual, hourly, and weekly rates as well.  To derive 
the annual rate, the monthly rate was multiplied by 12; to derive the weekly rate, the annual rate 
was divided by 52 (weeks in a year); to determine the hourly rate, the annual rate was divided by 
1,864 (working hours in a year). 
Attendants and Counter Staff 
Attendants will be responsible for assisting travelers with the function of the fingerprint scanning 
devices at both the check-in counters and the gates.  In the Proposed Rule, it was assumed that the 
attendants would be employees who earn $60,000 per year.  In addition to the attendants that 
carriers employ in carrier-implemented solutions, each alternative assumes some time for carrier 
personnel to assist the travelers at the counters.  Table A-5 below shows how the carrier hourly 
rate was derived.

For those alternatives assuming government implementation, it was assumed the Attendants would 
be mid-level labor grade 7 federal employees.  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) tables 
were used to determine the salary rate that was then burdened with published pension, health, 
and life insurance factors to determine an annual rate.  Table A-6 below shows how this 
government labor rate was derived.

These attendant rates were determined based on annual salaries.  To determine the hourly rates, 
the annual salaries were divided by 1,790 working hours in a year.

A.1 General Methodology 
• Met with representatives and SMEs within each of the US-VISIT branches directly involved 
in the following major cost categories: 
o Program Management 
o Information Technology 
o Facilities 
o Training 
o Outreach 
• Identified number of in-scope airports and seaports and classified these according to size. 
• Identified number of in-scope airlines and sea carriers.  Classified airlines according to size 
to assure that all small airlines remain out-of-scope. 
• Developed detailed interactive cost model. 
• Determined average number of gates, counters, and stations per size of airport and seaport 
to identify the number of required devices. 
• Determined cost per device to calculate acquisition cost. 
• Estimated number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) and duration for each stage of the 
development effort. 
• Established average labor rates based on skill level mix and national averages. 
• Calculated labor cost for both government and carrier industry. 
• Estimated additional hardware and software cost for mid-tier infrastructure, connectivity 
and networking, and test equipment. 
• Estimated additional cost impact on Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Arrival and Departure Information System 
(ADIS). 
• Estimated facilities impact to carrier industry and government including site surveys, 
counter modifications, Local Area Network (LAN) room improvements, storage areas and 
signage. 
• Incorporated independent estimate for Training. 
• Phased the application development effort to coincide with the December 2008 FOC date.  
The investment costs allocated to year two were estimated based on the percentages 
determined in a previous estimate of quarterly costs. 
• Estimated O&M costs and phased them to begin at the completion of the investment effort 
and continue for an additional three years and three quarters to bring the total period of 
performance to five years.  O&M costs were estimated for both the government and the 
carriers. 
• Inflated all out year dollars beginning in year two in accordance with Office of 
Management and Budget guidelines.

A.1.2 Independent Verification and Validation 
This cost accounts for independent verification and validation of the software and hardware for the 
solution.   
• IV&V costs for the airlines and sea carriers are estimated at 1 percent of the total application 
development costs.  This is based on historical averages.   
• IV&V costs for the government are estimated based on supporting eight planning/working 
group meetings during the development phase, development of all UDM artifacts, and on 
historical costs. 
• Table A-8 below shows the cost breakout for IV&V.

A.1.3 Information Technology 
Information Technology costs are largely derived from the ITM US-VISIT Deploy vs. Airline Deploy 
comparison estimate.  These costs have been adjusted to reflect the populations of airlines and 
airports, sea carriers and seaports, and to reflect derived labor rate factors.   
 
A.1.3.1 IT Site Surveys 
The costs for IT site surveys assume on-site surveys with teams of 2 at a 10 percent sample of 
airports and seaports prior to deployment.  
• Site surveys require sending teams of two to 10 percent of airports or seaports that they 
serve prior to deployment, at an hourly rate of $122.39 per person.  These teams will 
allow observation of the counter areas where necessary and the gate areas.  These site 
surveys will last two days, and will require one day of travel.  Pre-trip preparation will 
require an equal amount of days for each airport and seaport, 4 hours per day.  Travel costs 
and additional labor for post-trip work are also included. 
• The table below shows the cost breakout for IT Site Surveys.

A.1.3.2 Impact to IDENT 
Additional hardware will be required to support the increase of biometric data being sent to and 
stored within IDENT.  Additional matcher capacity will be needed to support the biometric search 
process used within IDENT.  Since the Exit prints will be stored in IDENT, additional database 
storage capacity will also need to be added. 
A.1.3.2.1 IDENT Assumptions 
• Fingerprints taken at exit will not be used for the purpose of enrollment. 
• Both segmented finger and slap images will be stored. 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

• No enforcement action will be taken at exit so quick turnaround will not be necessary. 
• The storage costs are an annual expense. 
• The verification ratio on 1:1 matches is 81 percent. 
• New exit transactions will use the existing Search & Assign process. 
• Additional operational and environmental support costs are anticipated, but have not been 
included at the current time.

A.1.3.3 CBP Development Costs 
CBP development costs are estimated to involve the receipt of data coming from the airlines (as 
part of the APIS Quick Query (AQQ) message), parse the US-VISIT required data, and forward that 
data to US-VISIT.  Estimates are based upon an analogy to work done by CBP in support of US-
VISIT's 10-print effort.

A.1.3.5.5.1 Software Deployment Assumptions 
• Airline and Sea carrier personnel will require 1 week per location for software deployment. 
• Government oversight personnel will inspect and verify 12 locations (9 airports, 3 
seaports), requiring 2 days per location.  This is a statistically significant data point sample. 
• Help desk will operate 24 hours a day, 6 days a week, 3 people per shift to account for 
vacations, holidays and other time off for a period of 9 months (39 weeks). 
• Overall duration of the deployment effort will be 24 weeks but is dependent on individual 
airline and sea carrier schedules.  Help desk will remain in operation an additional three 
months to accommodate any further issues. 
A.1.3.5.5.2 Software Deployment Labor 
• Airline and sea carrier deployment costs assume 2 FTEs per airline/sea carrier per 
airport/seaport at a weekly rate of $4,895.76 for 1 week. 
• Government deployment costs assumed 6 FTEs at a weekly rate of $4,895.76 for 14 weeks. 
• Government help desk costs assume 9 FTEs at a weekly rate of $4,895.76 for a total of 39 
weeks to staff the help desk. 
A.1.3.5.5.3 Software Deployment Travel 
A.1.3.5.5.3.1 Software Deployment Travel – Airlines and Sea Carriers 
• The deployment travel cost for airlines and sea carriers assumes $3,000 travel cost per trip 
to each of the ports by each airline/sea carrier serving that port for planning and for 
deployment.  The $3,000 cost includes airfare, hotel, car rental, and per diem. 
A.1.3.5.5.3.2 Software Deployment Travel – Government 
• The deployment travel cost for the government includes some travel for Program 
Management. 
o This cost assumes that the government will sample 12 locations (10 percent of the 
total locations), each requiring 2 days.  $1,600 per trip includes airfare, car rental, 
hotel, and per diem for 8 people at each site (6 employees to deploy the solution, 
and 2 program management personnel)

A.1.3.6 Collection Devices 
An assumption was made that collection devices will be deployed to departure gate areas at 80 
percent of airports, and to check-in counter areas at 20 percent of airports.  It is assumed that 20 
percent of each airport size will deploy to the counters (e.g. 20 percent of large airports, 20 
percent of medium airports, and 20 percent of small airports).  An assumption was made that 
there will be a device deployed to every counter station at the airports where the counter solution 
is in effect; two scanning devices would be installed at each counter for international departure 
gates.  In addition, a scanning device would be installed at every attendant station for commercial 
sea carriers.    
A.1.3.6.1 Solution Deployment to Airports 
Major variables associated with the deployment of the solution at airports include the number of 
airports, the total international departure gates at each airport, the total counters at each airport, 
and the total number of stations per counter. 
• Number of in-scope airports – 73  (source – OAG, with FAA size designations)

• It was assumed that there would be one biometric collection device installed at every 
check-in counter station, and two biometric collection devices for every departure gate 
area counter. To compensate for the fact that airlines do not always segregate their 
departure gates by whether they serve domestic or international flights, the number of 
gates to which the solution must be deployed has been increased by 50 percent.  This is 
recognized as the Pareto factor in the table below. For the purposes of this estimate, there 
is no difference between a counter that is outside the sterile area of an airport and a 
counter that is within the sterile area of an airport. 
• The table below shows the calculations that went into determining the total number of 
scanners at airports for the solution.

A.1.4 Facilities 
Facilities costs will be incurred by the carriers at both the airports and the seaports.  Facilities costs 
to the airlines and sea carriers are broken down by site surveys, architecture design/redesign, 
counter modifications, LAN equipment room modifications, and signage.  It is assumed that any 
government facilities oversight costs are accounted for in the Program Management cost category. 
 
A.1.4.1 Facilities Site Surveys 
The costs for IT site surveys assume on-site surveys with teams of 3 at all airports and seaports 
prior to deployment.  
• Site surveys with teams of 3 are conducted at each in-scope airport to observe both the 
check-in area and the departure area, and once at each seaport by each airline and sea 
carrier who serves those ports.  These surveys will be conducted prior to IT design Critical 
Design Review.  The composite hourly rate for those conducting the survey is $122.39 per 
person.  These surveys will last two days, and will require one day of travel for each visit.  
Pre-trip preparation will require an equal number of days for each airport and seaport, 4 
hours per day.  Travel costs and additional labor for post-trip work are also included.

A.1.5 Training 
A.1.5.1 Industry 
Training cost estimates were provided by the US-VISIT Office of Training.   
• The following assumptions were used to derive this estimate. 
o These costs represent only stand-up training costs.   
o These costs represent only training costs associated with the collection of 
biometrics and associated procedures. 
o These costs include the initial costs of training staff and materials.   
o These costs do not include the costs for training labs and equipment.  
o These costs do not include the costs to train new employees or the costs of 
knowledge sustainment training. 
o Airline training costs are estimated to be $147,000 per carrier, including personnel 
manning both counters and gates.  These costs are based on an average number of 
airports per carrier, 3 days of training per air carrier per airport.  It is assumed that 
each carrier will need to train 50 people at each location. 
o Sea carrier training costs are estimated to be $169,000 per carrier.  These costs are 
based on an average number of seaports per carrier, 5 days of training per carrier 
per seaport.  It is assumed that each carrier will need to train 100 people at each 
location. 
o The cost of lost time for carrier employees was not considered in this estimate.

o This cost includes costs to develop and provide workforce readiness materials to 
federal training partners such as CBP, U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (CIS) 
and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  US-VISIT will update ADIS, 
Software Integration Testing (SIT), and IDENT training materials to share with 
these users.  These federal training partners will customize the provided materials 
to develop their own training courses as appropriate.   
o For each of these federal training partners, US-VISIT will need to post materials to 
Web/LMS, develop a training plan, customize materials, execute train the trainer 
training, and evaluate the training after completion. 
o US-VISIT will not design, develop, or execute training for the carriers.     
o The majority of the government training costs are expected to be incurred in 
developing and executing training for the DHS and IDENT help desks.

A.1.7 Operations and Maintenance 
After the initial fifteen months of investment costs, the program will move into the O&M phase.  
During this time, the cost of the program focuses on operating the solution that has been 
implemented, and maintaining the program.  The following assumptions were used to derive the 
O&M costs. 
• As the investment phase is anticipated to extend 3 months into the second fiscal year of the 
program lifecycle, it is assumed that O&M will not begin until the second quarter of FY 
2009. 
• Those costs associated with maintaining the updates to ADIS, CBP, and the development of 
the application will continue at a steadily declining rate (15 percent in year 2, 12 percent 
in year 3, 9 percent in years 4 and beyond) as it is assumed that major problems with the 
system will decrease as the program matures.  As the investment phase extends three 
months into the second year of the program, annual O&M costs were reduced by 25 
percent in the first year of O&M. This 25 percent reduction factor does not apply to years 
beyond year 2. 
• Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment period 
total Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two. As a result, 
year 2 includes only 75 percent of the 40 percent Project Management O&M factor, while 
years 3 and beyond show the full 100 percent. 
• Hardware and COTS software maintenance costs will continue at rates of 10 percent and 
18 percent respectively of the investment costs of the program, beginning one year after 
installation.  
• Data communications circuit costs ($30 per carrier per port per month) will remain at the 
same rate as estimated in the Investment Phase, as these costs will remain constant 
throughout the life of the program. 
• Each counter and gate at an airport would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 days per 
week.  As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing passengers 7 days a 
week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation for 6 hours per day, 4 days 
per week.  Attendants will be present to handle technical issues and problem resolution for 
the scanning devices. 
o At the airport check-in counters, each attendant will be able to monitor each of the 
workstations installed at an individual counter location (about 6 in the large 
airports, 4 in the medium airports, 2 in the small airports).  At the seaport check-in 
counters, each attendant will be able to monitor 6 workstations, the number 
installed at a counter in a seaport. 
o At the departure gates, each attendant will be able to monitor 2 workstations.  
Interviews with SMEs at TSA revealed that the existing carrier staff at the departure 
gates will be able to absorb 1/3 of the functionality of US-VISIT Biometric Exit 
with no additional staffing.  Additional staff will be added to accommodate the 
remaining 2/3 of the Exit functionality. While the number of devices deployed to 
the gates has been increased by 50 percent to compensate for airlines that do not 
segregate their departure gates by domestic and international flights, the number of 
staff has not been increased since the numbers of flights and in-scope alien travelers 
is not assumed to change as a result of this increase.  Even though devices will be 
deployed to additional gates, not all of these gates will need to be in operation at 
the same time. 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

o This results in 7,073,014 additional attendant hours to be billed. 
o Attendant support begins at FOC, currently the second quarter of FY 2009. 
• The industry labor rate for attendants was assumed to be $33.52 per hour.  This was 
determined based on the hourly rate of a conservative annual salary estimate of $60,000 
per year for the counter representatives divided by 1,790 billable hours per year.  
• 52 Million aliens per year would exit through the ports, each requiring an average of 66.6 
seconds worth of additional time to process.  Current carrier counter personnel will assist 
with the majority of transactions as part of the normal check-in and departure process, 
with carrier-employed attendants assisting with uncharacteristic transactions and 
responding to problems and questions. 
o This results in about 962,000 total counter hours per year to staff the devices. 
o These new hours will be charged at the above described labor rate. 
o In year 2, counter support begins in the second quarter at FY 2009. 
• The total number of stations is 7,176 (4,434 for airports, 2,742 for seaports). The number 
of stations used to calculate the number of staff is slightly lower.  This is based on the 
inclusion of additional gates to which the solution will be deployed at the airports and the 
assumption that the staff will not need to increase to accommodate this increase in gates as 
the numbers of flights and travelers will not change.  The number of stations used to 
calculate the staffing level is 6,166 (3,424 for airports, 2,742 for seaports). 
• Important observation about attendant headcounts and costs: 
o The total number of attendants appears large in relation to the number of stations 
to be deployed.  This occurs because each attendant will work a 40 hour week, and 
each station is in operation for 18 hours per day, seven days per week, or 126 
hours per week (at the airports) or 6 hours per day, four days per week (at the 
seaports).  Even though each attendant monitors more than one station at a time, 
the operational time per year of each station requires multiple shifts per day, which 
in turn causes the number of full-time attendants to be relatively high in 
comparison to the number of devices.   
o The table below shows the total headcount of attendants required to implement the 
Exit solution.

A.1.8 Delay and Disruption Cost Assumptions 
Base Case Percentage of Flights Delayed 
Variable Description: This is the percentage of flights that have delayed departures. The definition 
of a delay is a departure time 15 minutes or more later than scheduled. The delays are for the base 
case (i.e., period before any of the proposed alternatives are implemented). 
Between 1996 and 2006 (inclusively) the average percentage of flights delayed by 15 minutes or 
more was 17%.77 This average is for all flights, both domestic and international. As this number 
has a high degree of uncertainty surrounding it, the upper and lower ranges around the median 
are wide. They can be seen in the table below.

Average Value of Time for Travelers (per hour) 
Variable Description: The average value of time is the premium that the average person places 
upon time spent waiting in line or being processed at exit. It can be thought of as the value an 
individual places on the most highly valued alternative use of his or her time. This value applies to 
all travelers, both aliens and out-of-scope travelers. 
In a study prepared for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding various aspects of 
valuing factors such as passenger time, injury, etc.,78 it was estimated that the value of time for 
passengers using air carriers ranged from $23.30 per hour for personal trips to $40.10 for 
business. These dollar figures are in 2000 terms, but per FAA direction are not inflated to 2008 
values.79 The upper 5% limit is assumed to be $35.60, and the median is assumed to be an all

Average Cost of Flight Delays ($ per minute) 
Variable Description: Average cost of flight delays to airlines in dollars per minute. This excludes 
the cost of airline personnel at counters and gates. According to a recent academic report, the costs 
of delay to an airline in 2004 were broken out as can be seen in the table below.

As of the prevailing exchange rates on December 31, 2004,80 the 36 Euros cited in the above table 
came to $49.10. Adjusting for inflation between 2004 and 2006, the $49.10 was estimated as 
being $52.40 in 2006 dollars.81 The 2008 dollar equivalent was calculated by assuming that 
inflation between 2006 and 2008 would be equal to the average inflation rate between 1996 and

Preparation Time Delays for Aliens at Airlines Caused by Implementation Location (seconds)  
Variable Description: This is the additional delay time caused to all aliens due to the 
implementation of an alternative by location (i.e., gate, security checkpoint, check-in counter, and 
kiosk) in seconds. The time includes that required to process an alien’s fingerprints (including 
ancillary paperwork and activity) but does not include the time that an alien is in queue until the 
actual processing stage commences.  
It is assumed that traveler preparation time does not vary between private and public sectors. It is 
also assumed that preparation times are the same at the check-in counters, security check point 
and the gates.  The median for all locations and airport size is 14.1 seconds with a lower 5% limit 
of 11 seconds and an upper 5% limit of 17 seconds. 
Data Sources: US-VISIT subject matter expert. 
This time estimate is composed of three distinct elements: 1) Four seconds biometric scan 
preparation, 2) five seconds biometric scan, and 3) four seconds biometric scan confirmation.  
The biometric reader will only scan for a maximum of five seconds before the machine selects an 
image for transmission. 
 
Time Required for Collecting Biographic Information at TSA Checkpoints (seconds) 
Variable Description: This is the time required, at the TSA checkpoint, to process an alien’s 
biographic information. In the current state this time is zero as TSA personnel do not currently 
collect biographic information. Under the TSA alternative, however, TSA personnel would also 
have to electronically capture biographic information to associate with the biometric data.

This time is only applicable to TSA checkpoints as biographic information is already processed or 
available at both the check-in counter and the gates as part of current operating procedures. Hence 
the implementation of Exit will not impose this task over and above the base case for these 
alternatives. 
Biographic processing at TSA checkpoints, based on available data, requires a median of seven 
seconds.

Queue Time for Travelers Resulting from Implementation of Alternatives by Location 
(seconds) 
Variable Description: This is the additional delay time caused to all travelers due to the queue 
time required before biometric processing. This time is in seconds. It should be noted that there 
are no queue time delays caused to TSA security check-in points as a result of implementation of 
Exit. The reason for this is that TSA is doubling staff at these locations. According to TSA the 
doubling of the staff will eliminate queues at these check-in points.

Average Number of Annual Flights that are Delayed as a Result of Implementing Exit 
Variable Description: This is the average number of international airline flights that are delayed 
annually as a result of the implementation of Exit.  
The equation used to estimate the number of outbound international flights delayed in 2008 as a 
result of the implementation of Exit is as follows: 
(% of Passengers Missing Connecting Flights as a Result of implementation of Exit (0.5%)  X   
% of in-scope travelers in 2008 (55.3 million)  /

Average fully laden capacity of a 747 
= 587.2 Delayed Flights Per Year 
Where each term is defined as follows: 
% of Passenger Missing Connecting Flights as a Result of the implementation of Exit 
The proxy that has been used for this term is the percentage of in-scope travelers missing 
connecting flights as a result of the implementation of APIS. In a recent CBP report two estimates 
were provided for the percentage of in-scope travelers who would miss their flights as a result of 
APIS, a “high” and a “low”.84 The high estimate was 1% and the low 0.5%.85 APIS is a more 
delay-intensive process than Exit, because transmission is tied to “wheels up” permission.  
Therefore, it is assumed that Exit will, on average, cause 0.5% of passengers to get delayed 15 
minutes or more beyond their required last boarding time. This analysis assumes a high of 0.75% 
of passengers will be delayed and a low of 0.25% of passengers will be delayed. 
% of In-Scope Travelers in 2008  
The estimated number of in-scope travelers in 2008 has been estimated at 55.3 million. This 
number will increase on an annual basis according to the assumption made in the Regulatory 
Evaluation (i.e., 4% growth per annum). 
Average Fully Laden Capacity of a 747 
This is the full passenger carrying capacity of a 747-400. In a three class configuration (first class, 
business class, economy class) this model of aircraft can hold 416 passengers and in a two class 
configuration (business and economy class) it can hold 524 passengers. The mid-point of 470 is 
assumed to be the “typical” fully loaded capacity.  
Based on the above figures, a total of 587.2 planes would be expected to be delayed in 2008. That 
number would increase in direct proportion with the increases in in-scope population per year.  
It is assumed that the lower 5% bound is at 293.6, the upper is at 880.9 and the median is in-
between, at 587.2.

Average Flight Delay (Minutes) 
Variable Description: This is the average flight delay (in minutes) of the “typical” delayed flight.  
In 2006 the difference between scheduled and actual departure time (i.e., aggregate delay time) 
for all U.S. domestic non-stop flights was 70,857,247 minutes.86 During that same period there 
were a total of 7,141,922 U.S. domestic non-stop flights.87 Data from the Department of 
Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics TranStats database for 2006 shows that the 
percentage of flights delayed 15 minutes or more was 20%.88 Hence the average delay time for 
those flights that were delayed is 49.6 minutes. This has been rounded to 50 minutes.  
As the data mentioned in the above paragraph is for U.S. domestic non-stop flights and does not 
include international flights there are reasons to believe the delay estimate to be conservative. This 
assumption is based on a number of facts. One is that international flights, on average, are 
lengthier than domestic flights. This causes more problems with respect to maintenance, refueling 
and weather. In addition, due to the nature of international travel, there are other potential 
problems that are not encountered in domestic flights (i.e., customs, etc.) that can potentially 
cause delays. Hence the 50 minute estimate should be thought of as being conservative. It is 
assumed that if any of the alternatives being considered a cause of a flight delay there will be no 
difference in the length of the delay.

87 Delay data was not available for international flights.  
88 The Department of Transportation’s definition of flight delay is dichotomous. Flights not delayed for 15 minutes or 
more are not considered “delayed” while all those 15 minutes and over are.

Percentage of Aliens on International Flights taking Connecting Flights with Domestic Legs 
Variable Description: This is the percentage of aliens on International Flights taking Flights with 
Domestic Legs. The purpose of this term is to determine the number of aliens who will, in airports 
upon completing a domestic flight, before boarding an international flight, have to leave the gate 
area and go to the airline counters for biometric fingerprint processing. This variable is used, with 
the time required for the trip to the counter, to estimate the amount of total time (and value of 
that time) that aliens will have spend in this process. It should be remembered that aliens will only 
need to do this at small and medium sized airports. At the large airports counters for biometric 
fingerprint processing will be located behind TSA security areas so aliens will not have to spend 
this time at large airports.  
The percentage of aliens falling into this category is estimated to be 27%. This number was 
estimated from a sample of data, provided by US-VISIT, for the week of April 22 through April 
28, 2007. The data used to estimate the 27% can be seen in the table below.  
Data Source: Based on data provided by US-VISIT for the week of April 22 through April 28,

A.1.9 Examination of Alternatives 
This section examines four alternatives to the Proposed Rule.  The Proposed Rule involves the 
airlines installing the scanning devices in the check-in area at 20 percent of domestic airports with 
international departures and the departure gate area at 80 percent of those airports.  Because of the 
layout of a typical seaport, the biometric collection will occur only at the check-in area. 
The alternatives to the Proposed Rule are: 
• Biometric collection at the check-in area or departure gate area of domestic airports with 
international departures; all application, development, and acquisition costs to be incurred 
by the government (Alternative 3). 
• Biometric collection at the check-in area of all domestic airports with a TSA presence 
serving medium and large carriers; all application, development, and acquisition costs to 
be incurred by the carriers (Alternative 1). 
• Biometric collection at all domestic airports at the TSA security checkpoint; all application, 
development, and acquisition costs to be incurred by the government (Alternative 2). 
• Biometric collection at kiosk locations of domestic airports with international departures; 
all application, development, and acquisition costs to be incurred by the government 
(Alternative 4). 
Alternatives that examine solution deployment to only the gates in airports are assumed to be an 
extreme scenario of the Counter/Gate solutions that are presented in this document.  As a result, 
gate solutions are not independently presented. 
Depending on the solution, there are differing combinations of airport/seaport and airline/sea 
carrier that will affect the number of devices that will be required for each solution.  The specific 
cost elements that feed each solution are described in the appropriate sections below. 
General Methodology 
• The cost estimate for each solution is based heavily on the general methodology 
information outlined in Section A.1 above.  
• Costs in all tables are shown in thousands of dollars unless otherwise indicated. 
• Specific methodology for each alternative is described in the appropriate sections below. 
 
Alternatives 
The following sections describe the basic methodology that was used to determine the cost of each 
of the alternatives. 
Counter Solution with Carrier Implementation 
In this alternative, the airlines and sea carriers will develop and deploy the solution to the check-in 
counter area.  The carriers will need to establish connectivity with the US-VISIT servers to allow 
their networks to send transactions.  The carriers will build the biometric devices and deploy them

to the check-in counter area.  Carrier personnel will be responsible for the collection of 
biometrics.   
 
Alternative Assumptions 
General Assumptions 
• The solution will be deployed to each airport with a TSA presence that serves medium and 
large airports, a total of 304 airports. 
o This total assumes 30 large airports, 31 medium airports, and 243 small airports. 
• The solution will be deployed to each of the seaports included in the Proposed Rule, a total 
of 33 seaports. 
• The cost of the device will be $7,500, as estimated in the Proposed Rule. 
• The total number of collection devices to be acquired will be 11,990 (9,248 at the 
airports, 2,742 at the seaports). 
o These calculations assumed that a large airport would have an average of 28.9 
counters with 6.02 stations at each counter; a medium airport would have an 
average of 16.8 counters with 4 stations at each counter; a small airport would 
have an average of 9.2 counters with 2 stations at each counter. 
o These calculations for the seaports are the same as the Proposed Rule. 
Cost Element Assumptions 
• Program Management cost assumptions: 
o Program Management costs will be factored at the same percentage as the Proposed 
Rule, 15 percent for both the carriers and the government. 
• Independent Verification and Validation cost assumptions: 
o The IV&V factor for the carriers remained at 1 percent of the IT Development costs. 
o Independent Verification and Validation costs for the government have not 
changed from the Proposed Rule. 
• Other government partners cost assumptions: 
o Costs associated with IDENT, ADIS, and CBP development have not changed from 
the Proposed Rule. 
• Information Technology cost assumptions: 
o The 5 percent cost factor for development and test hardware is incurred by the 
carriers, the same as in the Proposed Rule. 
• Facilities cost assumptions: 
o The costs associated with site surveys are increased from the Proposed Rule as the 
carrier teams will now be visiting 304 airports rather than the 73 in the Proposed 
Rule. 
o Facilities costs associated with LAN equipment room modifications are assumed to 
be $15,000 for 25 percent of the airlines at each airport and seaport.

RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  A-48
o The facilities costs associated with architecture design/redesign, counter 
modifications, and signage are estimated in the same manner as the Proposed Rule. 
• Training cost assumptions: 
o Training costs for the carriers are increased due to the carriers’ need to train 
employees at a greater number of airports than the Proposed Rule (the seaports 
remain the same).  Training costs for the government remain the same as in the 
Proposed Rule. 
• Outreach cost assumptions: 
o As was the case in the Proposed Rule, Outreach costs for the carriers are based on a 
factor of 5 percent of total IT, Facilities, and Training costs. 
o Outreach costs for the government are assumed to be $2,000,000.  This is in line 
with an estimate provided by the US-VISIT Office of Program Integration and

• O&M cost assumptions: 
o As the investment phase is anticipated to last 3 months into the second fiscal year 
of the program lifecycle, it is assumed that the O&M will not begin until the 
second quarter of FY 2009. 
o Those costs associated with maintaining the updates to ADIS, CBP, and the 
development of the application will continue at a steadily declining rate (15 
percent in year 2, 12 percent in year 3, 9 percent in years 4 and beyond) as it is 
assumed that major problems with the system will decrease as the program 
matures.  As the investment phase lasts three months into the second year of the 
program, these costs are reduced by 25 percent in the first year of O&M.  This 25 
percent reduction factor does not apply to years beyond year two. 
o Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment 
total Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two. 
o Hardware and COTS software maintenance costs will continue at rates of 10 
percent and 18 percent respectively of the investment costs of the program, 
beginning one year after installation. 
o Data communications circuit costs ($30 per carrier per port per month) will 
remain at the same rate as estimated in the Investment Phase, as these costs will 
remain constant through the life of the program. 
o Each counter at an airport would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 days per 
week.  As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing passengers 7 
days a week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation for 6 hours per 
day, 4 days per week. Attendants will be present to handle technical issues and 
problem resolution for the scanning devices. 
 At the airport check-in counter at a large airport, each attendant will be able 
to monitor about 6 workstations.  At each counter at a medium and small 
airport, each attendant would be able to monitor 4 workstations.  Although 
there are fewer counters at small airports, and the counters there are 
smaller, it is assumed that since the medium and large airlines are 
responsible for implementing this solution, they would have larger counter 
areas at the small airports.  At the seaport check-in counters, each attendant 
will be able to monitor 6 workstations.   
 This results in a total of 15,039,117 attendant hours per year. 
 In year 2, attendant support begins in the second quarter of FY 2009.

o The labor rate was assumed to be $33.52 per hour.  This was determined based on 
the hourly rate of a conservative annual salary estimate of $60,000 per year for the 
counter representatives divided by 1,790 billable hours per year. 
o 52 million aliens per year would exit through the ports, each requiring an average 
of 66.6 seconds worth of additional time to process.  Current carrier counter 
personnel will assist with the majority of transactions as part of the normal check-
in process with carrier-employed attendants assisting with uncharacteristic 
transactions and responding to problems and questions. 
 This results in about 962,000 total counter hours per year to staff the 
devices. 
 These new hours will be charged at a rate of $33.52 per hour. This was 
determined based on the hourly rate of a conservative annual salary 
estimate of $60,000 per year for the counter representatives divided by 
1,790 billable hours per year. 
 In year 2, counter support begins in the second quarter of FY 2009. 
o The total number of stations is 11,990 (9,248 for airports, 2,742 for seaports). 
o Important observation about attendant headcounts and costs: 
 The total number of attendants appears large in relation to the number of 
stations to be deployed.  This occurs because each attendant will work a 40 
hour week, and each station is in operation for 18 hours per day, seven 
days per week, or 126 hours per week (at the airports) or 6 hours per day, 
four days per week (at the seaports).  Even though each attendant monitors 
more than one station at a time, the operational time per year of each 
station requires multiple shifts per day, which in turn causes the number of 
full-time attendants to be relatively high in comparison to the number of 
devices. The total attendant headcount is higher under the government-
deployed solution than under a carrier-deployed solution because the total 
billable hours per year is smaller for the government attendants than for the 
carrier attendants. 
 The table shows the total attendant headcount for the carrier-deployed 
counter solution.

TSA Solution with Government Implementation 
In this alternative, US-VISIT will develop and deploy the solution to the TSA checkpoint areas.  The 
biometric collection will be taken with a mobile scanning device.  Network connectivity will be 
provided via TSA's network rather than the airlines’.  As seaports do not have TSA checkpoints, the 
solution at the seaport will be identical to the third alternative, with US-VISIT developing and 
deploying the solution to the sea carrier counters.  Note that, as this alternative occurs outside of 
the area of work of the airline employees, it includes only minimal airline-incurred investment 
costs.  These costs are associated that with the need to indicate in-scope alien travelers on the 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

boarding pass.  This will assist TSA in identifying the in-scope alien travelers which will minimize 
queuing time at the TSA checkpoints.  The majority of carrier costs for this alternative are incurred 
by sea carriers in the O&M phase. 
Alternative Assumptions 
General Assumptions 
• There are a total of 80 airlines that will need to implement some change to their boarding 
pass to identify in-scope alien travelers. 
• The table below, provided by the Office of Workforce Utilization at TSA lays out the 
number of airports in each category as designated by TSA.  For the purposes of this 
estimate, airports in Categories X and I are assumed to be large airports, Category II 
airports are assumed to be medium airports, and airports in Categories III and IV are 
assumed to be small airports.  These categories do not apply to any other alternative in this 
estimate. 
Table A-49: TSA Airport Categories with TSA Checkpoints and Lanes 
Category Total Checkpoints Total Lanes
X 212 929
I 150 569
II 95 206
III 124 150
IV 174 176
Total 755 2030  
• Based on information received from TSA, it is assumed that there are 455 airports with a 
total of 755 TSA checkpoints nationwide, with a total of 2,030 lanes at those checkpoints. 
• It is assumed that there is currently one Travel Document Checker (TDC) employed by TSA 
for every two lanes in operation.  In order to minimize the delay as a result of the 
implementation of the Exit solution, the number of TDCs will need to be increased to one 
for every TSA lane.  The number of devices is assumed to be one device for every two TSA 
lanes, with one Attendant per device.  Counter mounted devices and kiosks are not 
possible due to space constraints. 
o In order to account for possible failures in the mobile devices, a spare device was 
included for each mobile device deployed to small airports, where only one device 
was deployed per checkpoint.  At medium and large airports, spares will be 
purchased at a rate of 20 percent of total required devices.  These spares will be 
available in the event one of the mobile devices malfunctions or otherwise becomes 
unusable. 
o Based on these calculations, there are a total of 1,349 mobile devices will be 
purchased, 1,015 of which are required to meet the needs of the Exit solution. 
• As there is no TSA presence at seaports, the solution for the seaports will be identical to the 
Proposed Rule, with the exception that the government will purchase the scanning devices.  
There were assumed to be 2,742 stations at seaports.  
• The cost of the devices at the airports will be $5,686 per device.  This is based on historical 
estimates for the mobile devices. At the seaports, the devices will be the same counter-
mounted solution deployed in the non-TSA solutions, at a cost of $6,500 per device.

• With the exception of modifications to the boarding passes, all software development 
effort will be the responsibility of the government. 
Cost Element Assumptions 
• Program Management cost assumptions: 
o Government Program Management costs will be factored at the same percentage as 
the Proposed Rule, 15 percent. 
• Independent Verification and Validation cost assumptions: 
o Independent Verification and Validation costs for the government have not 
changed from the Proposed Rule.   
• Other government partners cost assumptions: 
o An additional FTE was added to coordinate data sharing between CBP and TSA for 
the Exit solution. 
o Otherwise, costs associated with IDENT, ADIS, and CBP development have not 
changed from the Proposed Rule. 
• Information Technology cost assumptions: 
o The 5 percent cost factor for development and test hardware is now incurred by 
the government. 
o Each international airline will need to modify their boarding pass to include some 
identification that a traveler is an in-scope alien. 
 With the assumption that there is enough space on the boarding passes to 
include this identifier, the modifications are not expected to be significant.  
Each of the 80 airlines will need one person working for four hours at a 
rate of $122.39 to develop this modification. 
o All other IT Development costs are now incurred by the government, and will be 
reduced because the government will be able to develop a single solution, while 
each carrier would have been developing an individual solution under a carrier-
implemented solution. 
• Facilities cost assumptions: 
o The costs associated with site surveys differ from the Proposed Rule as even though 
only one government team will be visiting each airport once, rather than a team for 
each airline visiting each airport, there is a larger number of airports to visit.  These 
costs are now incurred by the government. 
o The facilities costs associated with architecture design/redesign are assumed to be 2 
engineers working for 2 weeks to design the solution at an hourly rate of $122.39 
at each airport and for each carrier at each seaport. 
o It is assumed that space will be needed to store the mobile devices, charge the 
batteries, upload data from the scanners, and transmit the data to the US-VISIT 
servers. 
 At 25 percent of TSA checkpoints, current TSA office space will be sufficient 
to house these new requirements. 
• At 80 percent of these locations, new power and networking 
capabilities will need to be added to accommodate the Exit 
requirements. 
• At 20 percent of these locations, no modifications will be necessary. 
 At the remaining 75 percent of TSA locations, new space will need to be 
leased by the government to house these new requirements.

• At 10 percent of these locations, a new room will need to be built 
to accommodate the Exit requirements. 
• At the remaining 90 percent of these locations, an existing office 
space in the airport will be modified to house the Exit requirements. 
o At 80 percent of these locations, new power and networking 
capabilities will be needed to accommodate the Exit 
requirements. 
o At 20 percent of these locations, no modifications will need 
to be made to accommodate the Exit solution. 
 Locations requiring only updates to power and networking capabilities will 
require two electricians working for three days at a rate of $100.00 per 
hour.  They will need to install two circuits at each location, requiring 
$200 for the breakers and installation of 200 feet of conduit and wiring 
(100 feet per circuit) at a rate of $11.00 per foot at each location for a total 
of $1,300 in materials per location.  The electrical update costs will total 
$5,054 per location. 
 Locations requiring full build-out of new space will cost $300 per square 
foot for construction of a 100 square foot room.  These locations will also 
require electrical updates for a total of $35,054 per location. 
 Locations requiring TSA to lease space that they do not currently lease will 
require TSA to lease space at a rate of $65 per square foot per year. 
o Electricians will need to consult with airport personnel to determine the electrical 
modifications necessary to each airport.  This will cost $5,000 for the contractor 
per airport. 
o There are additional facilities costs associated with the implementation of a mobile 
solution.   
 Each TSA checkpoint will require a personal computer with 2 SD card 
readers to upload data from the mobile scanners and transmit data to the 
LAN rooms and to US-VISIT servers. 
• The personal computer is estimated to cost $2,500, and each SD 
card reader is estimated to cost $40. 
 For each device purchased, 12 spare batteries will be purchased to power 
the device at a rate of $88 per battery. 
 For every four batteries purchased, a quad charger will be purchased to 
charge the batteries, at a cost of $419 per charger. 
o At the seaports, counter modifications assume three contractors working for three 
days at a rate of $100 per hour.  While these costs are estimated based on the 
number of carriers at each seaport, they are incurred by the government. 
o Facilities costs associated with LAN equipment room modifications are assumed to 
be $5,000 for each TSA checkpoint at each airport and each counter area at each 
seaport, and will be incurred by the government. 
o The facilities costs associated with signage are estimated in the same manner as the 
Proposed Rule.  Two directional signs will be installed at each airport, and 
informational signs will be installed at each TSA lane to support the mobile 
solution.  These costs will be incurred by US-VISIT. 
• Training cost assumptions: 
o Training costs are derived based on a need for 6 personnel at each device, at a GS-
11 rate of $45.52 per hour.  These personnel are trained for 3 days, 8 hours per 
day.  One trainer, at the same GS-11 rate, would train 30 students at a time, and 2

people would spend 9 days preparing the course materials.  These costs are added 
to the government training costs estimated under the Proposed Rule. 
• Outreach cost assumptions: 
o Outreach costs are assumed to be $2,000,000 for the government.  This is in line 
with an estimate provided by the US-VISIT Office of Program Integration and 
Mission Services. 
• O&M cost assumptions: 
o As the investment phase is anticipated to last 3 months into the second fiscal year 
of the program lifecycle, it is assumed that the O&M will not begin until three 
months into the second program year. 
o Those costs associated with maintaining the updates to ADIS, CBP, and the 
development of the application will continue at a steadily declining rate (15 
percent in year 2, 12 percent in year 3, 9 percent in years 4 and beyond) as it is 
assumed that major problems with the system will decrease as the program 
matures.  As the investment phase extends three months into the second year of the 
program, these costs are reduced by 25 percent in the first year of O&M.  This 25 
percent reduction factor does not apply to years beyond year two. 
o Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment 
total Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two.  
o Hardware and COTS software maintenance costs will continue at rates of 10 
percent and 18 percent respectively of the investment costs of the program, 
beginning one year after installation. 
o Data communications circuit costs ($30 per carrier per port per month) will 
remain at the same rate as estimated in the Investment Phase, as these costs will 
remain constant through the life of the program. 
o At each airport where TSA will need to lease new space to store the mobile devices, 
TSA will need to lease 100 square feet at a rate of $65 per square foot. 
o Each airport TSA location would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 days per 
week. At airports, the attendants will be responsible for capturing the biometrics 
with the mobile devices. 
 At the airport TSA checkpoints, each government attendant will be able to 
monitor 1 device.  It is assumed that it will be the sole task of an individual 
to monitor each mobile device at the TSA checkpoints. 
 This results in a total of 6,517,440 attendant hours per year at the airports 
beginning in the second quarter of FY2009.  
o As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing passengers 7 days a 
week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation for 6 hours per day, 4 
days per week. Attendants will present to handle technical issues and problem 
resolution for the scanning devices. 
 At the seaport check-in counter areas, each government attendant will be 
able to monitor 6 workstations.   
 This results in a total of 570,336 attendant hours per year at the seaports 
beginning in the second quarter of FY2009. 
o The labor rate was assumed to be $30.99.  This is the midpoint of a GS-7 labor rate 
based on the national average GS schedule from OPM. 
o Additional TDCs will be required to minimize delay.  The current staff has one TDC 
for every two TSA lanes.  The new personnel will bring this total up to one TDC for 
every lane.  These personnel are billed at an hourly rate of $37.74, which is the 
midpoint of a GS-9 on the OPM scale divided by 1,790 billable hours.  These 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

personnel will also require a $13,000 onboarding cost to initiate their 
employment.  It is expected that the modifications to the boarding pass that are 
being applied by the carriers will mitigate the need for these new staff, but they are 
included here to account for the possibility that they may be needed. 
 This is a total of 1,015 new FTEs, and a total of 3,725 new staff members 
subject to the $13,000 onboarding costs. 
o 52 Million aliens per year are expected to exit through the ports.  Of those 52 
Million, it is expected that one out of every nine will exit through the seaports.  
Each of these aliens will require 66.6 seconds worth of additional time at the 
seaports with carrier-employed counter personnel as a result of the new 
requirements.   
 This results in about 106,889 total counter hours per year at seaports to 
staff the devices.  
 In year 2, counter support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
 As this alternative is outside the realm of the air carrier’s scope of work, the 
air carriers will incur no counter costs in the implementation of this 
alternative.  Counter personnel will, however, still be assisting in the 
collection of biometric data at the seaports. 
 The cost for counter personnel hours will be charged at a rate of $33.52 per 
hour. This was determined based on the hourly rate of a conservative 
annual salary estimate of $60,000 per year for the counter representatives 
divided by 1,790 billable hours per year. 
o The total number of stations is 3,756 (1,015 for airports, 2,742 for seaports).   
o Important observations about attendant headcounts and costs: 
 The total number of attendants appears large in relation to the number of 
stations to be deployed.  This occurs because each attendant will work a 40 
hour week, and each station is in operation for 18 hours per day, seven 
days per week, or 126 hours per week (at the airports) or 6 hours per day, 
four days per week (at the seaports).  Even though each attendant monitors 
more than one station at a time, the operational time per year of each 
station requires multiple shifts per day, which in turn causes the number of 
full-time attendants to be relatively high in comparison to the number of 
devices.   
 The table below shows the total attendant and TDC headcount for the TSA 
solution.

In this alternative, US-VISIT (rather than the airlines and sea carriers) will develop and deploy the 
solution to the departure gate areas at 80 percent of airports, and at the check-in counter areas at 
the remaining 20 percent of airports where the layout of the gate areas makes the deployment of a 
gate solution infeasible.  The carriers will have responsibility to assist with connectivity to their 
network to enable set up of an electronic connection to a DHS server to send transactions.  US-
VISIT will acquire the biometric collection devices and deploy them to the carrier counters and 
gates.  While government attendants will be available to provide assistance and respond to 
problems as necessary, carrier personnel will mainly be responsible for the actual collection of the 
biometrics as part of their normal check-in and departure processing.   
Alternative Assumptions 
General Assumptions 
• The solution will be deployed to a total of 73 airports with international departures, the 
same airports considered in the Proposed Rule. 
• The solution will be deployed to each of the seaports included in the Proposed Rule, a total 
of 33 seaports. 
• The cost of the device will be $6,500, with the assumption that the government will be 
able to negotiate greater equipment discounts than the airlines and sea carriers. 
• The total number of collection devices to be acquired remains the same as the Proposed 
Rule. 
• All software development effort will be the responsibility of the government.

Cost Element Assumptions 
• Program Management cost assumptions: 
o Program Management costs will be factored at the same percentage as the Proposed 
Rule, 15 percent. 
• Independent Verification and Validation cost assumptions: 
o Independent Verification and Validation costs for the government have not 
changed from the Proposed Rule. 
• Other government partners cost assumptions: 
o Costs associated with IDENT, ADIS, and CBP development have not changed from 
the Proposed Rule. 
• Information Technology cost assumptions: 
o The development costs incurred by the carriers in the Proposed Rule are now 
incurred by the government. 
o All IT Development costs are now incurred by the government, and will be reduced 
because the government will be able to develop a single solution, while each 
carrier would have been developing an individual application under a carrier-
implemented solution. 
o The 5 percent cost factor for development and test hardware is now incurred by 
the government. 
• Facilities cost assumptions: 
o The costs associated with site surveys are reduced from the Proposed Rule as only 
one government team will be visiting each airport, rather than a team for each 
airline visiting each airport.  These costs are now incurred by the government. 
o Facilities costs associated with LAN equipment room modifications are assumed to 
be $15,000 for 25 percent of the airlines at each airport and seaport, and will be 
incurred by the government. 
o The facilities costs associated with architecture design/redesign, counter 
modifications, and signage are estimated in the same manner as the Proposed Rule, 
but will now be incurred by the government. 
• Training cost assumptions: 
o It is assumed that each attendant monitoring the stations will be able to monitor 6 
stations at the check-in counters, and 2 stations at the departure gates.  Therefore, 
the training costs will be similar to those estimated in the Proposed Rule, and will 
be incurred by the government.  These costs will be added to the government-
induced training costs under the Proposed Rule. 
• Outreach cost assumptions: 
o Outreach costs are assumed to be $2,000,000 for the government.  This is in line 
with an estimate provided by the US-VISIT Office of Program Integration and

• O&M cost assumptions: 
o As the investment phase is anticipated to last 3 months into the second fiscal year 
of the program lifecycle, it is assumed that the O&M will begin in the second

matures.  As the investment phase extends three months into the second year of the 
program, annual costs are reduced by 25 percent in the first year of O&M.  This 25 
percent reduction factor does not apply to years beyond year two. 
o Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment 
total Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two   
o Hardware and COTS software maintenance costs will continue at rates of 10 
percent and 18 percent respectively of the investment costs of the program, 
beginning one year after installation. 
o Data communications circuit costs ($30 per carrier per port per month) will 
remain at the same rate as estimated in the Investment Phase, as these costs will 
remain constant through the life of the program. 
o Each counter and gate at an airport would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 
days per week.  As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing 
passengers 7 days a week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation 
for 6 hours per day, 4 days per week. Attendants will be present to handle technical 
issues and problem resolution for the scanning devices. 
 At the airport and seaport check-in counters, each attendant will be able to 
monitor each of the workstations installed at an individual counter location 
(about 6 in the large airports, 4 in the medium airports, 2 in the small 
airports).   
 While the carriers had existing staff at the gates, and were able to absorb 
some of the functionality of the Exit solution, the government does not 
currently have a presence at the gates.  At the airport departure gates, each 
attendant will be able to monitor 2 workstations. 
 This results in a total of 9,284,914 attendant hours per year. 
 In year 2, attendant support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
o The labor rate was assumed to be $30.99 per hour.  This is the midpoint of a GS-7 
labor rate based on the national average GS schedule from the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) divided by 1,790 billable hours per year.  
o 52 Million aliens per year would exit through the ports, each requiring an average 
of 66.6 seconds worth of additional time to process.  Current carrier counter 
personnel will assist with the majority of transactions as part of the normal check-
in process with government-employed attendants assisting with uncharacteristic 
transactions and responding to problems and questions. 
 This results in about 962,000 total counter hours per year to staff the 
devices. 
 In year 2, counter support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
 These new hours will be charged at a rate of $33.52 per hour. This was 
determined based on the hourly rate of a conservative annual salary 
estimate of $60,000 per year for the counter representatives divided by 
1,790 billable hours per year. 
o The total number of stations is 7,176 (4,434 at for airports, 2,742 for seaports.  
The number of stations used to calculate the staff is 6,166 (3,424 for airports, 
2,742 for seaports). 
o Important observation about attendant headcounts and costs: 
 The total number of attendants appears large in relation to the number of 
stations to be deployed.  This occurs because each attendant will work a 40 
hour week, and each station is in operation for 18 hours per day, seven 
days per week, or 126 hours per week (at the airports) or 6 hours per day,

four days per week (at the seaports).  Even though each attendant monitors 
more than one station at a time, the operational time per year of each 
station requires multiple shifts per day, which in turn causes the number of 
full-time attendants to be relatively high in comparison to the number of 
devices.  The total attendant headcount is higher under the government-
deployed solution than under a carrier-deployed solution because the total 
billable hours per year is smaller for the government attendants than for the 
carrier attendants. 
 The table below shows the total attendant headcount for the government-
deployed counter/gate solution.

Kiosk Solution with Government Implementation 
In this alternative, US-VISIT (rather than the airlines and sea carriers) will develop and 
deploy the solution using kiosks spread throughout the airports, and counter-mounted devices at 
the seaports.  The carriers will have responsibility to assure that all in-scope alien travelers have 
provided a biometric prior to boarding.  US-VISIT will acquire the biometric collection devices 
and deploy them throughout the ports.  Government contractor attendants will be available to 
provide assistance and respond to problems as necessary.   
Alternative Assumptions 
General Assumptions 
• The solution will be deployed to a total of 73 airports with international departures, the 
same airports considered in the preferred solution. 
• The solution will be deployed to each of the seaports included in the preferred solution, a 
total of 33 seaports. 
• Solution deployment to the seaports will be identical to the preferred solution, except that 
the government will incur the costs of application development and deployment. 
• A model provided by the US-VISIT Office of Administration and Logistics provided base 
data as to the minimum number of kiosks required to service in scope travelers.  Using this 
base data, an independent analysis was conducted that considered number of flights and 
passengers per flight to determine peak hours of operations and the number of kiosks that 
will be required to meet the increased demand at that time.  Using data from this analysis, 
a revised number of devices was derived.  In addition, approximately 25 percent of 
international passengers arrive at an international airport via a connecting flight.  To 
accommodate those passengers arriving with a very short connection time, the number of 
kiosks was then increased by 40 percent.  These kiosks will be installed at strategic 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

locations within the domestic terminals of international airports.  The number of kiosks 
required at the airports will be 1,821, with 131 spares, for a total of 1,952 kiosks. 
• The cost of each kiosk at the airports will be $13,220.  This is consistent with the US-VISIT 
1B pilot with the exception that barcode scanners will now be installed capable of scanning 
2 dimensional barcodes and PDAs/cell phones. 
• The number of counter-mounted devices required at the seaports is unchanged from the 
preferred alternative, a total of 2,742 devices. 
• The cost of each device at the seaports will be $7,500.  This is based on the US-VISIT 1B 
pilot but modified to include barcode scanners for both the boarding pass and cell 
phones/PDAs. 
• The airlines and sea carriers will develop software to modify the barcodes on the boarding 
passes, making them compatible with the requirements of US-VISIT and identifying in-
scope travelers.  The airlines will also need to incorporate a US-VISIT provided decision 
tree into the reservation process in order to determine in-scope passengers.  All other 
development effort will be the responsibility of the government. 
Cost Element Assumptions 
• Program Management cost assumptions: 
o Program Management costs will be factored at the same percentage as the preferred 
solution, 15 percent for both the carriers and the government. 
• Independent Verification and Validation cost assumptions: 
o Independent Verification and Validation costs for the government have not 
changed from the preferred solution. 
o Based upon historical averages, IV&V costs for the carriers are assumed to be 1 
percent of the total application development costs. 
• Other government partners cost assumptions: 
o Costs associated with IDENT, ADIS, and CBP development have not changed from 
the preferred solution. 
• Information Technology cost assumptions: 
o Airlines will incur IT application development costs to modify the barcodes on the 
boarding passes in order to make them compatible with the US-VISIT IDENT 
system.  Additional work will be necessary to develop an application, based on a 
US-VISIT provided decision tree, which will determine whether passengers are in 
scope. 
 Each airline will require 3 FTEs for 4 months of effort at a monthly rate of 
$21,215 to plan the solution. 
 Solution design will require 3 FTEs for 4 months per airline at a monthly 
rate of $21,215. 
 Each airline will require 3 FTEs for 3 months at a monthly rate of $21,215 
to build the solution. 
 Application testing will require 3 FTEs for 3 months per airline at a 
monthly rate of $21,215. 
o The government will incur costs to enable the kiosks to read the modified barcodes 
on the boarding passes. 
 The government will require 3 FTEs for 4 months each for planning and 
design of both the front and back-end systems (24 months total), at a 
monthly rate of $21,215. 
 The government will require 3 FTEs for 3 month to build both the front 
and the back-end systems (18 months total), at a monthly rate of $21,215 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  A-60
 The government will require 3 FTEs for 3 months to test the front-end 
system, and the interaction of the systems (18 months total), and 3 FTEs 
for 2 months to test the back-end system (6 months total) at a monthly rate 
of $21,215. 
 The government will require 1 FTE for 14 weeks to deploy the solution to 
each of the airports, at a weekly rate of $5,303.74. 
o All other IT application development costs are now incurred by the government, 
and will be reduced from the preferred alternative because the government will be 
able to develop a single solution for each exit method (airports and seaports), 
while each carrier would have been developing an individual application under a 
carrier-implemented solution. 
o The number of kiosks required at the airports is based on analysis of a model 
provided by TSA wherein the number of devices required is based on the number 
and sizes of flights departing from a given airport over the course of the day.  
Using this model, the base number of kiosks required is expected to be 1,301.  
Approximately 25 percent of international passengers arrive at an international 
airport via a connecting flight.  To accommodate those passengers with a very short 
connection time, this number was then increased by 40 percent to allow for these 
additional kiosks to be installed in domestic terminals of international airports.  
This results in a total requirement of 1,821 kiosks.  An additional 131 spare kiosks 
were added for a total of 1,952 kiosks to be acquired.  The number of counter-
mounted scanning devices required at the seaports remains unchanged from the 
preferred solution, 2,742. 
o The 5 percent cost factor for development and test hardware is now incurred by 
the government. 
o Data circuit costs are doubled from the preferred alternative to account for the 
acquisition of wireless communication devices for the kiosks and the added cost of 
wireless communication from the kiosks to the LAN room. 
• Facilities cost assumptions: 
o It is assumed that the government will require $11,400 per port for Facilities Site 
Surveys at medium and small airports, and $22,800 per port at the large airports.  
This number is higher at the large airports to account for the need to deploy 
devices to both domestic and international terminals at large airports.   An 
assumption was made that domestic and international terminals at large airports are 
in separate buildings or at least separated in the same facility.  These costs include 
travel and per diem for teams of 4 to visit each area in each airport, and teams of 2 
to write follow-up reports. 
o Facilities design and follow-up will require $20,000 per large port, and $10,000 
per medium and small port.  These costs include design costs, coordination with 
the ports, build permits, design reviews, and documentation. 
o Facilities deployment costs are expected to be $8,525 per port for medium and 
small airports, and $17,050 for large airports.  This number is higher at the large 
airports to account for the need to deploy devices to both domestic and 
international terminals at large airports.  These costs are based on the assumption 
that 3 FTEs will work for 3 days at each area in each port.  There are also costs for 
reporting and follow-up included in this cost element. 
o The costs for installation of signage, including moving, support, and shipping, are 
assumed to be $12,500 per port for medium and small airports, and $25,000 per 
port at the large airports.  Again, this number is higher at the large airports to 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  A-61
account for the need to deploy devices to both domestic and international terminals 
at large airports.  These costs include costs for moving assistance, signage and 
signage posts/holders. 
o The facilities costs for modeling the solution are estimated to be $15,710 per port 
at the medium and small airports, and $31,420 per port at the large airports.  This 
number is higher at the large airports to account for the need to deploy devices to 
both domestic and international terminals at large airports.  These costs include pre 
and post installation data gathering and follow-on analysis, and assume 4 
contractors working for 3 days at each area in each port.  These costs also include 3 
FTEs for 3 days working on reporting and follow-up following the modeling 
effort. 
o The cost to provide power and networking capabilities to each kiosk is assumed to 
be $7,763 per kiosk.  These costs assume an average distance of 150 feet between 
the kiosks and the nearest LAN room.  Each bank of kiosks will require conduit ($4 
per foot) and wire ($10 per foot) to provide power and networking.  The 
installation of each kiosk will require 3 electricians for 2.5 days at a rate of $90 per 
hour.  The electricians’ fees and contingency costs are also included in the total cost 
per kiosk. 
o The intention is that the U.S. government will compel the airports to provide space 
for the exit solution.  In the event that does not happen, US-VISIT will need to lease 
space in which to put the kiosks, and in which to build office space.  It is assumed 
that each kiosk will require 9 square feet, at a cost of $90 per square foot per year.  
In addition to the base lease cost, an additional 8 percent Public Buildings Service 
charge will apply to the total leasing cost. 
o Office space build-out costs were assumed to be $450 per square foot.  Space 
required for office build-out is airport-specific, and is based on information 
provided by the US-VISIT Office of Administration and Logistics. 
• Training cost assumptions: 
o It is assumed that each attendant monitoring the stations will be able to monitor 3 
kiosks, except in the case of the kiosks that are added to accommodate the short-
connection times.  In those cases, since the kiosks will be more widely spaced, it is 
assumed that each attendant will be able to monitor only 2 kiosks at a time.  This 
equates to 2,547 attendants.  The methodology used to derive the training costs 
will be similar to that employed in the preferred solution, and will be incurred by 
the government. WSA training costs were based on three days training per 
individual at local sites.  Training costs recur annually at 20% of the initial 
workforce training cost.  These costs will be added to the costs to train US-VISIT 
and other government partner personnel incurred by the government under the 
preferred solution. 
o The carriers will need to train their employees for two purposes.  The 
representatives will need training in order to implement the decision tree, and the 
gate personnel will need training to determine whether passengers who are in 
scope have provided biometrics, and to handle those passengers who have not 
provided a biometric.  It is assumed that 10 percent of the workforce for the 
airlines interact with the traveling public and will therefore need training to 
prepare for the Exit solution, for a total of 115,631 employees receiving training.  
Each employee receiving training is expected to receive 4 hours of training at a cost 
of $32.89 per hour.  The airline trainers, and the US-VISIT personnel training the 
trainers, are expected to require 24,408 hours to conduct their training, at a rate of 
$32.89 per hour.   
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  A-62
• Outreach cost assumptions: 
o Outreach costs are assumed to be $2,000,000 for the government.  This is in line 
with an estimate provided by the US-VISIT Office of Program Integration and 
Mission Services. 
o Airlines and sea carriers have the incentive to ensure that all in-scope travelers 
comply with the requirement to provide biometrics.  Therefore, they will provide 
pamphlets, website updates, Public Service Announcements, and other forms of 
outreach to deliver the message to passengers.  These costs are consistent with 
Outreach costs associated with the preferred alternative.   
• O&M cost assumptions: 
o An inflation rate of 1.9 percent was used to inflate costs in the out years. 
o As the investment phase is anticipated to last 3 months into the second fiscal year 
of the program lifecycle, it is assumed that the O&M will begin in the second 
quarter of the second year of the program. 
o Those costs associated with maintaining the updates to ADIS, CBP, and the 
development of the applications will continue at a steadily declining rate (15 
percent in year 2, 12 percent in year 3, 9 percent in years 4 and beyond) as it is 
assumed that major problems with the system will decrease as the program 
matures.  Hardware maintenance costs are estimated at 25% of the acquisition cost.  
This factor is larger than historical norms to accommodate the fact that the kiosks 
are remote, stationary, and wireless and will require an on-site technician to repair 
rather than affording remote access. 
o Program Management costs will continue at a rate of 40 percent of the investment 
total Program Management cost, beginning in the second quarter of year two. 
o COTS software maintenance costs will continue at a rate of 18 percent of the 
investment costs of the program, beginning one year after installation.  Since the 
program is government-deployed, there are no carrier-incurred maintenance costs 
associated with COTS hardware and software. 
o Data communications circuit costs (the cost of wireless communication technology 
for the kiosks) are estimated at $60 per circuit to account for the wireless 
installation.  In addition, each kiosk will require a leased air-card to communicate 
and transmit data to the LAN rooms.  These costs will remain constant through the 
life of the program. 
o It is estimated that employee turnover will occur at a rate of about 20 percent per 
year.  Training costs will therefore continue throughout the life of the program at a 
rate of 20 percent of their investment total per year. 
o Since outreach is a continuous effort, it is assumed that the outreach costs will 
continue annually at the full rate of outreach investment over the life of the 
program. 
o It is assumed that each attendant will require a uniform allowance of $360 per 
year. 
o Each airport kiosk would be in operation for 18 hours per day, 7 days per week.  
As sea carriers do not process a continuous flow of departing passengers 7 days a 
week, it was assumed that sea carriers would be in operation for 6 hours per day, 4 
days per week.  Attendants will be present to handle technical issues and problem 
resolution for the scanning devices. 
 It is assumed that each attendant will be able to monitor 3 kiosks at the 
airports, except in the case of the kiosks that are added to accommodate the 
short-connection times.  For those 520 kiosks, it is assumed that each 
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  A-63
attendant will be able to monitor only 2 kiosks at a time since the kiosks 
will be widely spaced.   
 At the seaports, each attendant will be able to monitor all the stations at 1 
counter area, a total of 6 stations per attendant. 
 This results in a total of 5,129,040 attendant hours per year. 
 In year 2, attendant support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
o The attendant labor rate was assumed to be $32.89 per hour.  This is based on a 
conservative annual salary of $60,000 divided by 1,824 billable hours per year.  
o 52 Million aliens per year are expected to exit through the ports.  Of those 52 
Million, it is expected that 8 out of every 9 will exit through the airports.  The total 
in-scope population is expected to be about 30 percent of the total international 
traveler population, for a total of 154,074,074 international travelers per year.  It is 
estimated that 25 percent of the international traveling population will need to 
speak to an industry representative when making their reservations.  The in-scope 
air travelers (46,222,222 travelers) will require an average of 30 seconds to 
determine that they are in scope, while the remainder of international travelers 
would require 15 seconds to determine that they are not in scope.  It is assumed 
that the 38,518,519 passengers who would interact with an industry representative 
would require an average of 19.5 seconds to determine whether or not they are in 
scope.    
 This results in about 208,642 total representative hours per year to 
determine in-scope passengers at the airports. 
 In year 2, representative support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
 These hours will be charged at a rate of $32.89 per hour.  
o In order to verify that in-scope travelers have provided a biometric prior to 
boarding, the carriers will inspect a receipt issued by the kiosk confirming that 
each in-scope travelers has provided a biometric.  Carrier representatives will 
require 10 seconds per in-scope passenger to confirm the collection of a biometric. 
 This results in about 128,395 total gate hours to collect a confirmation of 
biometric collection from each in-scope passenger. 
 In year 2, gate support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
 These hours will also be billed at a rate of $32.89 per hour. 
o The remaining 1 out of every 9 in-scope alien travelers is expected to exit through 
the seaports.  Each of these aliens will require 66.6 seconds worth of additional 
time at the seaports with carrier-employed counter personnel as a result of the new 
requirements.   
 This results in about 106,889 total counter hours per year at seaports to 
staff the devices.  
 In year 2, sea carrier counter support begins in the second quarter at FOC. 
 These hours will be charged at the above-described rate of $32.89 per 
hour. 
o The total number of stations acquired is described in the IT section above, 4,694 
(1,952 at airports, including spares, 2,742 for seaports).  The number of stations 
used to calculate the staff is 4,563 (1,821 for airports, 2,742 for seaports). 
o Important observations about attendant headcounts and costs: 
 The ratio of attendants to devices at the airports in the table below appears 
large in comparison to the same ratio for seaports.  This occurs because, 
while each attendant at the seaports can monitor 6 devices at a time, the 
attendants at the airports can only monitor at most 3 devices at a time.  
US-VISIT                                                                               Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

Another reason for the disparity is that the operational time at the seaports 
is relatively small (6 hours per day, 4 days per week) compared to the 
operational time at the airports (18 hours per day, 7 days per week), 
requiring a greater number of attendants to fill the larger number of shifts 
required.

deployed kiosk solution.

Appendix B Benefits Assumptions and Data 
This section presents all data collected, estimations developed, and technical assumptions made to 
develop benefit estimates for the RIA.  We solicit any comments to improve the analysis to the 
greatest extent possible.  
Projected Annual Volume Growth of Travelers in General 
Definition: This is the rate at which the volume of all persons entering and leaving the U.S. (i.e., 
all categories, including VWP, US Citizens, immigrants, non-VWP nonimmigrant, etc.) is 
forecast to change from one year to the next. The rate of growth between in-bound and out-
bound are assumed equal. It is also expected that this rate stays the same throughout the life-span 
of the project.   
Travel association data estimates growth rates of 3.9 percent to 8.5 percent over the next few 
years.92 The U.S. Commerce Department estimates a 7 percent growth rate in travel over the 
next two years.93 This is consistent with recently released CBP data that cites a 4% projected 
growth rate in total travelers in 2004.94 The median estimate, therefore, reflects a conservative 
forecasted growth rate of 4 percent. That number, along with the estimated lower and upper 10% 
ranges, can be seen in the table below.

overstay of 181 days or more (within the previous 3 years of application) and 365 or more days 
(within the previous 10 years of application).95 Visa applications and egregious overstays are on a 
pre-appeal basis (as opposed to post-appeal). 
In FY 2006 a total of 5,836,718 non-immigrant visas were issued.96 In that same year a total of 
1,931,285 non-immigrant visas were rejected for all reasons, on a pre-appeal basis.97 Hence the 
total number of visas applied for in that year was 7,768,003. The number of non-immigrant visa 
applications rejected for egregious overstay reasons, on a pre-appeal basis, was 7,890. Hence the 
percentage of visa applications rejected for egregious overstay reasons was 0.1%. It is assumed that 
this percentage stays constant for the lifespan of the alternatives being examined. As there is a high 
degree of uncertainty surrounding this number there is a wide range around the median. The 
upper and lower ranges associated with the medium can be seen in the below table.

Number of Outbound International Flights 
Variable Description: This is the number of outbound international flights leaving from the U.S. 
in FY 2008. For the calendar year 2006 the number of non-stop flights leaving the U.S. for 
international destinations was 1,469,232.98 It is assumed that the number of flights leaving the 
U.S. increases at the same percentage rate as the growth in traveler volume, 4%. Hence it is 
estimated that, for 2008, the number of non-stop flights leaving the U.S. is 1,586,771. As there is 
significant uncertainty surrounding this number, there is a wide range associated with its median. 
This can be seen in the table below.

Total Number of Travelers Leaving U.S. Through International Airports 
Variable Description: This is the number of total travelers (both in and out-of-scope) taking 
international flights. 
As stated in a previous section of this appendix, the number of alien travelers has been estimated at 
55.3 million for FY 2008. This can be seen in the table below. According to Department of 
Transportation data, for calendar year 2006, foreign citizens accounted for 44.5% of all passengers 
leaving the U.S. on international flights.100 Assuming that this ratio also holds for FY 2008, the 
number of U.S. travelers (i.e., out-of-scope travelers) would be estimated (median) at 68.0 
million.

removal. 
Data Sources:  Local Fiscal Effects of Illegal Immigration, Report of a Workshop, National Academy of 
Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996. 
History of Variable:  The table below shows the costs to the taxpayer of illegal aliens.  Included in 
the costs are the incidental costs of monitoring or policing immigration policies, such as checking 
legal immigration status prior to hiring an employee or providing access to health services.  
Federal costs include judicial, detention, incarceration, and deportation costs for illegal 
immigrants.102 The costs associated with illegal immigrants are used as a proxy for visa violators. 
Table B-10: Taxpayer Costs of Illegal Aliens 
Removal of Illegal Aliens and Related Costs 
Criminal justice and corrections in 1993103 ($ in millions) $540.5
Formal Removals in 1993104 (number of illegal aliens) 42,542
Cost per Removal in 1993 $12,705
Cost per Removal in 2004105 $16,750
The $16,750 in 2004, after adjusting for inflation, was equal to $18,375 in 2007.106 Assuming 
that inflation between 2007 and 2008 increases at the same average per annum rate as it had 
between 1996 and 2006 (4.5%), the $18,375 removal cost would be equal to $19,202 in 2008 
dollars.107 This number can be seen in the below table. The range around that figure was based on 
SME opinion on the range associated with the $16,750 in 2004.

105 The 2004 estimated cost per removal was developed by inflating the 1993 cost per removal using the Consumer 
Price Index.  Since the value of preventing an illegal immigrant from entering is reflected in later removal costs, the 
same estimates are used for Cost Savings per Fraudulent Document, Cost Savings per Visa Overstay Detected, Cost 
Savings per Visa Violation Case Detected, and Cost Savings per Fraudulent Asylum Case Detected. 
106 The CPI (1982-4=100) index value was 187.6 in 2004 and for the first half of 2007 205.7.

Number of Travelers from Nations that may obtain VWP Status that are Expected to Travel to 
US for Purposes of Tourism  
Variable Description: This is the number of travelers expected to arrive in the U.S. for tourism 
from countries expected to become VWP nations in the near future. As the government only 
collects data on business and tourism short-term travel to the U.S. on an aggregated basis, it is not 
possible to break the two out. For this reason the data used for the analysis assumes that all short 
term travel to the U.S. is for tourism purposes. 
The analysis used to determine the growth in tourism as a result of a country moving from non-
VWP to VWP status was based on the travel volume to population rates of current VWP nations. It 
was assumed that as non-VWP nations gained VWP status, their travel volume to population ratios 
would become more similar to those of current VWP nations. With respect to the travel volume to 
population ratios of VWP nations, the ratios of the current VWP nations were calculated minus the 
following VWP nations: Australia, Iceland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (as these 
nations had much higher travel rates for reasons that would not applicable to other future VWP 
countries [i.e., use of the English language or proximity]), Andorra, Brunei, Liechtenstein, 
Luxemburg, Monaco, San Marino and Slovenia (no data was available for these nations). With 
respect to non-VWP nations, those examined included those that were being currently considered 
for VWP status minus the following nations: Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Slovakia, and Taiwan.  
The travel rates and populations of the countries discussed in the above paragraph were examined 
in 2000 and 2003. The data for these nations, for travel and population, for these years can be 
seen in the below table.

With respect to the above countries, a number of further assumptions apply. They are: 
 All countries, except Greece, assuming they are approved for VWP status, will be approved 
in 2011. If Greece is approved, it will be in 2009. 
 There will be a ramp up to full VWP travel rates over a four year period. The ramp up will

Hourly Compensation Rates of ICE Immigration Enforcement Officers  
Variable Description: This is the “fully burdened” average wage rate of a typical ICE Immigration 
Enforcement Officer. It includes gross hourly wage as well as benefits. The benefits were estimated 
by applying a multiplier of 32.8% to the wages. This was done in congruence with the 
recommendation put forth in the Department of Homeland Security’s 2006 Cost-Benefit Analysis 
Guidebook.111 
An ICE Immigration Enforcement Officer earns a salary in the range of GS  11/12/13, the most 
likely being the role of a GS-12. In addition to the benefit burden rate, Investigators also receive a 
25% annual bump for Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), which is an entitlement for GS 
1811 federal law enforcement personnel in lieu of overtime for non-scheduled work throughout 
the year.

Annual Baseline DIG Workload (Number of Cases)  
Variable Description: This is the base DIG (Data Integrity Group) workload in number of cases. 
The baseline number of cases for 2006 was 371,093. Assuming that the caseload increases at 4% 
per annum between 2006 and 2008, the number becomes 401,374. If it is assumed that annual 
growth is instead 2% it becomes 386,085 and if it is 5%, it becomes 409,130. The 4%, 2% and 
5% assumptions are traveler growth assumption and can be found discussed, in greater detail, in 
another section of this appendix.

Spending by Foreign Tourists Entering the U.S. (Dollars per Tourist)  
Variable Description: This is the average dollar figure that a foreign visitor spends in the U.S. 
while on a tourist oriented trip. According to a recent GAO report, this number in 2000 was 
$1,274.115 Converting 2000 dollars into 2007 dollars yields an amount of $1,495.116 Assuming 
that inflation between 2007 and 2008 increases at the same rate that it has between 1996 and 
2006 (4.5%), a number of $1,562 is derived. As a significant degree of uncertainty surrounds that 
number, a wide range surrounds it.

ICE Base Case Caseload 
Variable Description: This is the number of overstay ICE cases that ICE handles without the 
implementation of biometric exit. This number was estimated by using the following equation: 
(Number of Arrests in FY 2005/Number of Referrals in FY 2005) * Number of Referrals in FY 
2007 = Caseload 
The number of arrests in FY 2005 was 1,700, the number of referrals in that same year 1,441 and 
the number of referrals in FY 2007 11,772. These numbers produce a total of 13,890 annual 
cases.

Additional Delay to Aliens on International Flights with a Domestic Leg at Small and Medium 
Sized Airports (Minutes) 
Variable Description: This is an additional delay that aliens on international flights with a 
domestic leg must face. It occurs only at small and medium sized airports and stems from the fact 
that at those airports, on connecting flights, aliens must go to airline counters before passing 
through TSA. At “large” airports this issue does not exist as it is assumed that, at the large airports, 
there will be counters behind TSA. Hence the aliens will not have to back to airline counter areas 
and lose that time going and coming back from them. The time required, at the small and 
medium sized airports, to go to and return from the airline counters is assumed to be 30 minutes. 
This time is assumed to remain constant throughout life of Exit.  
 
Visa Overstayers Detected as Percentage of all Visa Overstayers (Percentage)

Appendix C Structure and Logic Diagrams 
This section provides the detailed logic used to estimate the benefits and net social economic losses 
associated with implementation.  The structure and logic diagrams presented describe the logic 
that connects the implementation to the outcome described.  For those benefits that are quantified, 
the diagrams also indicate the major data points and calculation steps used.  Readers should note 
that the logic associated with the benefit from expansion of the VWP is included here, but it is not 
rolled up into the PV of benefits presented in the Outcomes section. 
There is a lack of data concerning several of the variables used in this analysis.  Therefore, we had 
to make assumptions and calculate estimates in an environment of uncertainty and variance in 
industry and government operations.  The key assumptions that drive the cost and benefit analyses 
are described in detail in the RIA, and are summarized in Appendices A and B. We solicit any 
comments to improve the analysis to the greatest extent possible.

Appendix D Performance Measures 
Performance measurement is one of the critical tools to measure the success of an implemented 
solution. The performance measurement allows the project team to assess whether the solution 
meets its intended objectives and therefore realizes the projected benefits set at the planning and 
design stages. The performance measurement may consist of operational, economic, social, 
financial, strategic, and other elements.  
The benefit estimation under the cost benefit analysis task provides the project management with 
the economic elements that can be tracked over time to ensure that the specific solution or the 
program met its objective from the economic perspective. These elements are different from the 
conventional performance measures as they relate directly to the overall worthiness of the solution 
or the business case for the program rather than the specific operational aspect of the solution.  
The performance measures identification follows four key steps: 
• Step 1: Review all existing databases to ensure that all possible and useful indicators are 
identified; 
• Step 2: Select key indicators that meet the agency/stakeholders’ goals and objectives; 
• Step 3: Refine the list of performance indicators and begin populating the benefits/process 
matrix; and 
• Step 4: Build consensus among stakeholders for use of critical performance indicators. 
Once identified within the cost benefit analysis, the metrics are projected over the life cycle of the 
investment. These metrics can then be tracked as part of the performance measurement of the 
solution to assess its realized worthiness. This table is an example of the performance measures 
tracking process.

Performance Tracking 
In summary, while the cost benefit analysis assesses the worthiness of a solution or a program 
given its projected benefits in a specific time period, performance tracking assesses whether the 
realized benefits meet the projections and therefore serves as a decision-support mechanism to re-
design and/or adjust the existing solution so that it meets its promised benefits.  
This project will be assessed using the following critical success factors and performance measures 
and outcomes expected of the overall Comprehensive Exit project.

Percentage of Exit Records Matched to Entry 
Records 
 
A primary goal of the entry-exit system is to match 
an individual’s entry and exit record to allow DHS 
to verify that the individual complied with the 
authorized period of stay in the United States. 
Biographic and biometric data is collected and 
matched to existing records at 95% in 2008, 97% in 
2009 and 99% in 2010 for alien travelers. 
Data Integrity Group Average Cost to Vet and 
Review Records in Determining a Recommended 
Lead 
 
The DIG vetting process identifies overstay records 
and provides recommended leads to Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Compliance 
Enforcement Unit (CEU) for investigation. The 
primary function of the DIG is to assure the integrity 
of data shared with ICE. Therefore, the rate at which 
the DIG can supply these recommended leads to 
ICE-CEU, per information processing dollar 
expended, is a fundamental efficiency metric. 
Average Cost Per In-Country-Overstays Processed 
 
The average cost to send information to Federal 
agencies about foreign travelers who have 
apparently overstayed their authorized period of 
admission.  These travelers are termed In-Country 
Overstays. This is an indicator of US-VISIT 
efficiency in producing in-country overstay leads for 
law enforcement.  
Average Cost Per Out-of-Country-Overstays 
Processed 
The average cost to send information to Federal 
agencies about foreign travelers who have 
apparently overstayed their authorized period of 
admission.  These travelers are termed Out-of-
Country Overstays. This is an indicator of US-VISIT 
efficiency in producing in-country overstay leads for 
law enforcement. 
Number of VISA overstays detected as a proportion

Appendix E Gap Analysis 
The gap analysis identifies specific exit capabilities and discusses how well the current environment is able to meet those capabilities.  
The following table describes the gaps between the future state and the current state for the Biometric capture of Air/Sea Exits and 
relevant performance measures. 
 
Table E-1: Air/Sea Biometric Exit Capture 
Ability to determine whether in-scope traveler has left the country 
Current Environment Future Environment Gaps/Issues Performance Measures 
Identification of exit status is 
accomplished through the 
following process:  
• the traveler manually fills 
out the departure portion 
of the Form I-94  
• the carrier collects the I-
94 and submits it to DHS 
• DHS ships all collected I-
94 forms to a data entry 
facility 
• DHS’s designated 
contractor enters the I-94 
data into the entry-exit 
system 
Biometric data (fingerprints) of 
an in-scope traveler will be 
collected as a condition of 
being able to board the aircraft 
or vessel.  Air/Sea Biometric 
Exit will automatically record 
the exit on the traveler’s entry-
exit record.   
 
In the current environment, 
because of the many manual 
steps and length of time to 
enter the I-94 data into the 
entry-exit system, the 
likelihood is high that not all 
departures of in-scope travelers 
are recorded.  Furthermore, 
there is a lag in time between 
the departure of the traveler 
and the recordation of his or 
her exit from the country.

The process of collecting and 
recording the exit status of an 
in-scope traveler is manual and 
time-consuming. 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit will 
automatically record the exit on 
the traveler’s entry-exit record.   
The time-consuming manual 
process of entering exit data for 
each traveler provides the 
opportunity for incomplete and 
delayed recording of the exit.  
Furthermore, if the traveler 
were to attempt to re-enter the 
U.S., the delay in recording the 
exit data might not allow the 
most recent exit status or 
notices for further screening to 
be displayed to the CBP officer.

Ability to determine which in-scope travelers have overstayed the terms of their admission 
Current Environment Future Environment Gaps/Issues Performance Measures 
The entry-exit system relies on 
the manually collected and 
entered I-94 data to determine 
those persons who exited the 
U.S. who have overstayed the 
terms of their admittance.  
The future entry-exit system 
will rely on the more accurate 
and timely exit biometric data 
to identify the departed travelers 
who overstayed the terms of 
their admittance. 
In the current environment, 
because of the many manual 
steps and length of time to enter 
the I-94 data into the entry-exit 
system, the likelihood is high 
that not all departures of in-
scope travelers are recorded.  
Because determination of 
overstays is dependent today on 
the process of collecting and 
recording departure data from 
I-94 forms, the likelihood is 
high that not all overstays are 
identified.

Level of confidence in the identity of the exiting traveler 
Current Environment Future Environment Gaps/Issues Performance Measures 
Confirmation of the identity of 
an in-scope traveler is 
determined solely on biographic 
data presented by the traveler.  
The entry-exit system attempts 
to match the exit record to the 
entry record bearing the same 
name. 
The traveler will be identified 
using both biographic and 
biometric data.  The entry-exit 
system will determine whether 
the traveler has been seen by 
US-VISIT before and whether 
the biometric data submitted at 
exit matches the biometric data 
submitted at entry for the 
Reliance on biographic data, 
such as matching the name 
provided by the traveler to 
stored names, is fraught with 
risk.  A simple misspelling of 
the name – which may occur, 
for example, during the visa 
issuance process – would mean 
the identity of the traveler

Ability to obtain an accurate history of the traveler’s entry to and exit from the U.S. 
Current Environment Future Environment Gaps/Issues Performance Measures 
The CBP officer at the entry POE 
uses several tools to determine 
whether the traveler should be 
admitted into the U.S.  The 
traveler’s entry-exit record is 
one of them.  Furthermore, 
correct determination of 
overstays is dependent on 
accurate recording of entry and 
exit information.  Today the 
exit information is obtained 
from the manually collected 
Form I-94 and entered I-94 
data.   
The entry-exit record will still 
be a tool for the CBP officer.  
However, in the future, the 
traveler’s exit from the U.S. will 
be automatically and 
immediately recorded.  The exit 
data will be compared to the 
traveler’s entry data, so that an 
overstay can be determined. 
Without accurate and 
immediate recording of an in-

When a traveler enters the U.S., 
the CBP Officer enters 
biographic information from 
the traveler’s travel document 
into the CBP system.  In most 
cases at air and sea POEs, 
manifest data are available, and 
watch list queries and analyses 
are performed by the US-VISIT 
system prior to traveler arrival.  
The results of queries and 
analyses are pre-positioned for 
the CBP Officer (manifest data 
matches and biographic lookout 
hits).   
 
Depending on the information 
presented, the CBP Officer may 
interview the traveler.  The CBP 
Officer then makes an “admit” 
or “refer to secondary” 
decision.  Reasons for secondary 
inspection can be immigration 
violations, suspicion of terrorist 
activity, or suspicion of criminal 
activity. 
The process followed by the 
CBP Officer will not change.  
However, with Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit, the information 
about the traveler’s entry and 
exit history will be more 
accurate and current.  After the 
traveler provides biometric data 
at exit, Air/Sea Biometric Exit 
will search biometric watch lists 
and verify the identity of the 
traveler.  If any of the checks 
turns up suspicious 
information, analyses will be 
conducted and the traveler’s 
record will be noted.  If the 
traveler attempts to enter the 
country again, the appropriate 
flags will be displayed before 
the CBP Officer.   
When the entry-exit, identity, 
or watch list information on a 
traveler is not current or 
accurate, or if the CBP Officer 
does not trust the data, the CBP 
Officer may request the traveler 
be sent for secondary inspection 
more often than would 
otherwise be the case.  This 
delays the entrance of the 
specific traveler and potentially 
the admission of other travelers.

Appendix F  Air/Sea Biometric Exit Alternative 
Selection Process 
This RIA evaluates four alternatives for building a Biometric Exit Verification capability. 
The selected alternatives stem from a series of options related to the business process, 
location of collection, and funding approach for the program.  This section describes the 
process used to assess the alternatives for feasibility. 
It should be noted that this document describes a process used to assess a range of 
alternatives and select down to a set of feasible alternatives.  As such, some of the 
assumptions in this section maybe superseded by the RIA assumptions presented elsewhere 
in this document.  Assumptions in this section do not necessarily apply to the RIA as a 
whole. 
Introduction 
The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program 
records the arrival and departure of covered international travelers; conducts certain 
terrorist, criminal, and immigration violation checks on covered individuals; and compares 
biometric identifiers to those collected on previous encounters to verify identity.  US-VISIT 
has been implemented in phases beginning with an entry and a pilot exit program and 
expanding to additional capabilities, locations of implementation, or subject populations. 
US-VISIT integrates the immigration information collected into a combined picture of an 
individual.  As a result, more complete and timely information is available to appropriate 
decision-makers, such as consular officers overseas, Customs and Border Protection officers 
at the ports of entry, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service adjudicators, Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement agents in the interior of the United States, and U.S. Coast Guard 
officers offshore. 
The next significant deployment to further the US-VISIT Program is the capability to collect 
finger scans of alien travelers departing the U.S. by air and sea.  With such information, 
DHS can be more certain that an individual did, in fact, depart the U.S., and will be better 
able to match the record of their exit to their entry record.  This will ensure that future 
decisions determining eligibility for visa renewals, subsequent applications for admission 
to the U.S., and adjudications of immigration benefit applications are fully informed.  Also, 
this will allow interior immigration enforcement activities to more appropriately allocate 
resources. 
This document describes the alternatives considered for US-VISIT’s Biometric Exit project 
for the air and sea environments, and describes the process for conducting a high level 
assessment of each alternative.

Background 
US-VISIT is a major priority in DHS’s mission of ensuring the security of U.S. citizens and 
visitors.  US-VISIT has developed systems and processes to reliably identify alien 
travelers117  when they apply for entry to the U.S. and as they enter the U.S.  The US-VISIT 
Entry solution includes the collection of the visitor’s biometric and biographic data.  
Biometric and biographic data is stored in databases maintained by the U.S. Government in 
accordance with U.S. information technology security and privacy laws and regulations.  
This data is checked against watch lists to improve DHS decisions on visitor admissibility.  
The data also aids law enforcement officials in investigations of suspected terrorists or 
criminals.  The US-VISIT Entry solution has been deployed at 119 airports, 19 seaport 
locations, and 155 land ports that manage the entry of travelers from international 
countries. 
While biometric entry capabilities have been in operation, DHS still lacks the biometric 
capability to determine when an alien traveler has exited the U.S.  From January 2005 to 
May 2007, US-VISIT designed and deployed a temporary prototype biometric exit system 
at 12 airports and two seaports.  The pilot program demonstrated that a key factor in any 
successful biometric exit is integration of the biometric exit process into the traveler’s 
departure flow.  The Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project will include the collection of biometric 
data from each alien traveler during the traveler’s departure process. 
Scope 
Development of biometric exit for airports and seaports will follow a more accelerated 
path than for land ports.  This is due to the fact that there is more existing infrastructure to 
work with in air and sea ports than in the land environment.  Additionally, the vast 
majority of the sub-populations of alien travelers that DHS is concerned about, namely the 
Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and “Countries of Interest” travelers, travel in and out of the 
U.S. by air.  Since DHS is beginning with biometric exit at air and sea ports, this alternative 
analysis will only deal with those environments. 
The same classes of aliens that are presently in-scope for US-VISIT Biometric Entry will also 
be in-scope for Biometric Exit.  Biometric Exit will impact an estimated 52 million aliens 
annually.  When published, the “additional aliens rule” will expand the classes of aliens 
that are in-scope to include Lawful Permanent Residents, among others. 
Additionally, Air/Sea biometric exit will also impact a number of ports and carriers.  
Specifically: 
• 450 Total Airports, of which 122 are international airports 
• 274 Airlines serving the U.S., of which 138 have direct international departing 
flights

Strategic Alignment 
The 9/11 Commission Report recommended completion of an entry-exit system and 
noted that funding and completing a biometrics-based entry-exit system is an essential 
investment in our national security.  
“The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by Congress, 
should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system, 
including a single system for speeding qualified travelers.  It should be 
integrated with the system that provides benefits to foreigners seeking to stay in 
the United States.  Linking biometric passports to good data systems and 
decision-making is a fundamental goal.  No one can hide his or her debt by 
acquiring a credit card with a slightly different name.  Yet today, a terrorist can 
defeat the link to electronic records by tossing away an old passport and slightly 
altering the name in the new one.” 
“Completion of the entry-exit system is a major and expensive challenge.  
Biometrics has been introduced into an antiquated computer environment.  
Replacement of these systems and improved biometric systems will be required.  
Nonetheless, funding and completing a biometrics-based entry-exit system is an 
essential investment in our national security.” (p. 387) 
Congress has recognized the importance of improving entry and exit control and addressed 
the issue in a series of statutes directing DHS to build an automated, biometric entry-exit 
system.   
Likewise, Biometric Exit would support the priorities of “Control Our Borders” and 
“Protect lawful trade and travel by strengthening screening of travelers and workers” as 
directed by the DHS Integrated Planning Guidance.  This priority is articulated in the 
Secretary’s goal of “DHS will modify and test US-VISIT Exit operational plans at airports to 
expand the collection of biometric exit information on targeted populations including 
VWP travelers” (Near-term Goal 1.5.6).  Therefore, US-VISIT efforts to plan, develop, and 
deploy biometric exit capabilities are directly aligned with the Department’s core mission 
and goals. 
Since starting on January 5, 2004, the US-VISIT Program has operated using four strategic 
performance goals considered critical to achieving success. These performance goals are: 
• Enhance the security of United States (U.S.) citizens and visitors to the U.S. 
• Facilitate legitimate travel and trade 
• Ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration system 
• Protect the privacy of U.S. visitors  
Air/Sea biometric exit supports US-VISIT’s goals of enhancing the security of the U.S. and 
ensures the integrity of the U.S. immigration system.  If DHS has a better idea of who has

complied with the terms of their admission, then future decisions to determine the 
eligibility for visa renewals, subsequent applications for admission to the U.S., and 
adjudications of immigration benefit applications can be more fully informed.  
Additionally, interior immigration enforcement activities can more appropriately allocate 
resources. 
 
Analysis Methodology and Approach 
The methodology for assessing alternatives for the Air/Sea Biometric Exit solution was as 
follows: 
1. Identify the need for and objectives of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit project. 
2. Identify constraints and assumptions about the Air/Sea Biometric Exit. 
3. Identify possible alternatives that could be employed to meet the Air/Sea Biometric 
Exit objectives. 
4. Develop criteria associated with the Air/Sea Biometric Exit objectives that would be 
used to assess each alternative. 
5. Conduct the assessment. 
 
US-VISIT selected an initial preferred alternative after the assessment was completed.  This 
initial preferred alternative, along with the other, possible alternatives were further 
analyzed in a regulatory evaluation, cost-benefit analysis, and environmental analysis in an 
effort to further define and refine the analysis.  During these further evaluations, US-VISIT 
re-evaluated the constraints and re-selected a preferred alternative due to the need for the 
biometric solution to integrate with other DHS air and sea traveler initiatives.  
Subsequently, the possible alternatives were down selected to three alternatives in order to 
present the most viable alternatives in the NPRM, along with a focused and thorough 
evaluation of the associated costs and benefits.  
 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit Need 
Today, DHS has limited ability to identify which alien travelers who have entered the 
country remain in the country in violation of their admission period, and who has 
departed within that period.  Accurate recording of their departure will provide timely and 
much needed information for decision makers within the immigration and boarder 
management enterprise.   
Under the initial phases of the implementation of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project, 
biometric data will be used for the following purposes: 
• Overstay information will be analyzed by US-VISIT and forwarded to ICE for 
further follow-up and interior enforcement. 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-5
• Exit information will be used on an individual basis during subsequent applications 
for admission to the United States, visa issuance and renewal, and other 
immigration benefits. 
• Exit information will be analyzed in the aggregate to identify weak areas in our 
immigration and border management system where overstay is prevalent.  This will 
require the development of new analytic capabilities within DHS and DOS. 
While biographic information is presently being used to address these goals, biographic 
data tends to be less accurate then biometric, and may not be automated, thus requiring 
more time and resources.  Additionally, the biometric data collected, along with the new 
exit procedures, will provide DHS with a higher level of confidence that an individual was 
present in the airport and actually left the country, as opposed to collecting only 
biographic (name) information. 
An automated biometric exit system will also better inform DHS so that those that have 
overstayed may be identified as such and apprehended.  US-VISIT tracks and records entry 
and exit records to determine those who have overstayed their authorized period of 
admission.  Individuals who have overstayed the terms of their admission, or who are 
wanted or otherwise encountered by law enforcement, may be apprehended. 
 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit Objectives 
Through a variety of statutes, Congress has directed DHS to address the need to better 
record the departure of nonimmigrant aliens.  To meet Congressional mandates, DHS will 
collect data during exit to: 
• Match available data on an alien’s entry and exit. 
• Assist in identifying nonimmigrant aliens who have overstayed their period of 
admission. 
• Allow for calculation of VWP departure compliance rates. 
• Produce reports on entry and exit of aliens. 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit supports the overall US-VISIT mission goals (see Section F.1.3.).  
Specifically, Air/Sea Biometric Exit is expected to achieve the following objectives: 
• Record an alien’s departure from the U.S. and match to their entry record. 
• Ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration system through the sharing of entry 
and exit records with appropriate government partners in the immigration and 
border management enterprise. 
• Protect the privacy of alien visitors to the U.S.

Constraints are known restrictions placed on a project’s implementation, development, or 
interfaces – both by forces external and internal.  Examples of external constraints are 
Congressional mandates, oversight organizations, such as the General Accounting Office 
(GAO) or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and restrictions placed by 
interfacing organizations or systems.  Examples of internal constraints are technology 
maturity, people resources, and funding resources.  Assumptions are presumed 
restrictions, or hypotheses about the operational environment or other critical factors.  
Constraints and assumptions are considered in an alternatives assessment to refine the 
choice of alternatives being assessed and inform the assessment process. 
 
Constraints 
Five constraints were identified and applied in the alternatives assessment process: 
• Air/Sea biometric exit must align with the Pre-Departure APIS Final Rule 
requirements. 
DHS has a goal to align the many programs and requirements of its components.  
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has proposed a rule to enable CBP to 
collect passenger and crew information for flights and cruises bound for the U.S. 
prior to the carriers’ departure from foreign ports, as well as departure from the 
U.S.  This system is known as the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS).  
APIS data include such biographic data as full name, gender, and country of 
passport issuance.  Additionally, if there is intersection with the Transportation 
Security Agency’s (TSA) “Secure Flight” initiative, then Air/Sea biometric exit will 
also need to align with that program.  Secure Flight is a program designed to 
conduct a threat assessment on individual air travelers based on available 
biographic information. 
• US-VISIT must ensure that personally identifiable information (PII)118 collected on 
behalf of the U.S. Government is protected in accordance with applicable 
legislation, regulation, treaty and policy, including US-VISIT Policy and Privacy 
Principles.  Accordingly, a non-U.S. Government entity cannot use or store any PII 
collected on behalf of US-VISIT for their purposes.  Such PII includes, but may not 
be limited to, fingerprints and biographic information not currently collected by 
the non-government entity to support the entity’s existing business processes.  If a 
non-government entity collects PII on behalf of the U.S. Government to support 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit that entity must securely transmit the PII to the U.S. 
                                               
118 Personally Identifiable Information is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, 
including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment 
history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their 
name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records (for 
example, fingerprints and photographs), phone number, email address, physical address, signature, passport 
number, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, including any other personal information which 
is linked or linkable to an individual (Adapted from OMB M-06-19).   
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

Government and then purge the PII after the U.S. Government confirms receipt of 
the PII. 
• Biometric data collection must be associated with issuance of boarding pass.  The 
evaluation of the prototype exit system suggests that any biometric exit solution 
should be integrated with the traveler’s departure process.  This constraint suggests 
that a boarding pass may not be issued to an alien traveler until the traveler 
provides the required biometric data. 
• Law enforcement action during the departure process is not a required result of 
providing biometric data for Air/Sea Biometric Exit.  The purpose of the Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit Project is to collect biometric data of alien travelers on exit from the 
U.S. and to validate the data against stored entry data.  The Comprehensive Exit Charter 
states that Air/Sea Biometric Exit is not designed around law enforcement at the 
time of alien traveler exit.   
• Air/Sea Biometric Exit will be implemented by December 2008 at all U.S. ports 
from which commercial flights and cruises to international destinations depart.  By 
December 2008, the initial capabilities of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit will be 
deployed at each of the designated airports and seaports.  
In addition to the five constraints listed above, there is the potential that enactment of the 
recent 9/11 Implementation Bill could have an impact on planning for Air/Sea biometric 
exit.  Final interpretation from DHS Policy and Planning Office of General Counsel will be 
given to US-VISIT regarding the statute’s impact on Air/Sea Biometric Exit. 
 
Assumptions Used in Conducting the Assessment 
The following assumptions were made and applied in conducting the alternatives 
assessment: 
• The assessment of the alternatives does not consider specific technical solutions. 
• The entity (whether U.S. Government or other) that collects the biometric data 
purchases, owns, deploys, certifies, and maintains all the biometric collection 
equipment and software. 
• All alternatives will allow for auditing capabilities to ensure that business, security 
and privacy requirements are met. 
• All alternatives will allow for the same quality of print collection and identity 
verification. 
• Currently, collection will be primarily used to verify identity and confirm exit.  
However, in the future, enforcement action during exit may be taken in extreme 
situations. 
• There will be no coordination problems with TSA and CBP. 
• Sufficient outreach and education will be provided. 
• Benefits to enhancing the security and integrity of our immigration system are 
primarily away from the airport, in terms of identifying overstays for interior 
enforcement, and adjudicating re-entry or visa renewal. 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

• All PII will be collected, used, disclosed, and retained in accordance with applicable 
statute, regulation, treaty, department and component policy. 
• Per recommendations of the pilot evaluation, biometric exit will be incorporated 
into one of the steps intrinsic to departure: airline check-in areas, TSA checkpoints, 
or boarding gates. 
• Exit will not be utilized at “general aviation” airports, only at airports that have 
regularly scheduled international departures. 
 
Air/Sea Biometric Exit Alternatives 
The biometric exit project involves collection of the alien traveler’s biometric data as part 
of the departure process as well as validation of the biometric data.  The validation process 
involves matching the traveler’s exit record with their entry record. 
 
Basis for Alternatives Selection 
The selection of alternatives was focused on the collection of biometric data.  Validation of 
collected records and matching to entry records will occur at DHS data processing centers 
away from the ports, and will be the same regardless of the deployment alternative chosen.  
Therefore, the following variables were considered in the alternatives analysis: 
• Location for collection of biometric data 
• Entity or position responsible for collecting the biometric data 
For the airport or seaport departure environment, this analysis considered biometric data 
collection to occur at the check-in counter, the security checkpoint, or the departure gate.   
The entity or position responsible for collecting the biometric data could be either a U.S. 
Government representative or a representative of the airline or cruise line.  The five basic 
alternatives to be considered are the following:  
• At carrier check-in counter - Airline/cruise line responsibility 
• At carrier check-in counter - U.S. Government responsibility 
• At TSA security checkpoint - U.S. Government responsibility 
• At departure gate - Airline/cruise line responsibility 
• At departure gate - U.S. Government responsibility 
 
Description of Alternatives 
The alternatives assessment considered each of the five basic options plus three additional 
alternatives.  These additional alternatives are variations of the basic alternatives, to include 
verification of the biometric data at the departure gate, by a U.S. Government 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

representative.  Verification is conducted at the departure gate to determine whether the 
person who is providing the biometric data at the gate is the same as the person who 
originally provided the biometric data (for example, at the check-in counter or security 
checkpoint).  At least for the early deployments of the Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project, 
verification may be done randomly, in order to measure compliance with the Exit process. 
The eight Alternatives assessed in this analysis are the following (Alternatives F, G, and H 
are variations of Alternatives A, B, C, respectively): 
Alternative A:  At the Check-in Counter – Airline/Cruise line collection.  An 
airline/cruise line representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the 
airline or cruise line check-in counter. 
Alternative B:  At the Check-in Counter – U.S. Government collection.  A U.S. 
Government representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the airline or 
cruise line check-in counter. 
Alternative C:  At Security Check-Point – U.S. Government collection.  A U.S. 
Government representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the security 
checkpoint. 
Alternative D:  At Gate– Airlines/Cruise lines collection.  An airline/cruise line 
representative collects biometric data of alien traveler at the departure gate. 
Alternative E:  At Gate – U.S. Government collection.  A U.S. Government 
representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the departure gate. 
Alternative F:  At Check-in Counter – Airline collection with verification at gate.  
An airline/cruise line representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler at the 
airline or cruise line check-in counter, and a U.S. Government representative randomly 
verifies the data at the departure gate. 
Alternative G:  At Check-in Counter – U.S. Government collection with verification 
at gate.  A U.S. Government representative collects biometric data of the alien traveler 
at the airline or cruise line check-in counter, and a U.S. Government representative 
randomly verifies the data at the departure gate. 
Alternative H:  At Security Checkpoint – U.S. Government collection with 
verification at gate.  A U.S. Government representative collects biometric data of the 
alien traveler at the security checkpoint, and a U.S. Government representative 
randomly verifies the data at the departure gate.

It is against these Air/Sea Biometric Exit objectives that the Alternatives will be assessed.  It 
is understood that these assessment criteria are expressed at a high level and only are 
intended to identify the relative ability of the alternatives to meet the objectives. 
• Confidence of departure: The degree with which the U.S. Government is 
confident that an alien traveler submitting biometric data during the departure 
process has exited the U.S. 
• Percentage of population captured: The percentage of alien travelers whose 
biometric data is collected using this alternative. 
• Operational impact to the traveler: The additional amount of time or increase in 
processes required of the traveler during the departure process as a result of 
deploying this alternative. 
• Operational impact to the airlines/cruise lines: The additional amount of time or 
increase in processes required of the airline/cruise line during the departure 
process as a result of deploying this alternative. 
• Operational impact to the U.S. Government: The additional amount of time or 
increase in processes required of the U.S. Government during the departure process 
as a result of deploying this alternative. 
• Implementation cost to airlines/cruise lines: The cost (in dollars) to the 
airlines/cruise lines to develop, deliver, train for, and implement the solution. 
• Implementation cost to U.S. Government: The cost (in dollars) to the U.S. 
Government to develop, deliver, train for, and implement the solution. 
• Network/connectivity:  This factor considers how much new or additional 
computer network/connectivity would be needed for a given alternative.  This 
factor considers the connection to the DHS-supplied local and wide area data 
communications infrastructure to be located at an air or sea port and between a 
port and the IDENT system that securely transports a biometric query, including 
the traveler's biometric data, from a DHS scanning device at an airline/cruise line 
check-in counter to the DHS biometric matching system, IDENT.  This includes the 
return path and infrastructure, which may not be the same as the incoming path, 
that provides a “yes” or “no” response back to the airline/cruise line so that the 
airline/cruise line may properly print or deny printing of a document that 
authorizes each individual traveler to board the carrier. 
• Privacy: This factor considers the potential of the PII collected for this effort being 
used for non-governmental purposes.  US-VISIT aims to protect the privacy of the 
covered individuals by limiting the collection of PII and securing the PII against 
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or retention. 
• Information Technology (IT) security:  This factor considers how strong IT 
security could be for a given alternative.  IT security aims to maintain the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and infrastructure.  It is 
established by considering threats and vulnerabilities and developing mitigating 
factors proportional to the resulting risks and the value placed on the data or assets.

• Impacts to European Passenger Name Record (PRN) Agreements:  The potential 
that the alternative could negatively impact existing data sharing agreements with 
the European Union. 
• Number of Collection Points: The number of locations requiring deployment, 
with the assumption that a lower number was better.  Alternatives involving all 
450 airports would impact 274 airlines.  Alternatives involving only the 82 airports 
with departing direct international flights would impact only 138 airlines. 
• Training Cost to Airlines/Government:  Costs associated with startup of new 
systems.  
 
Assessment of Alternatives 
The alternatives were assessed against the objectives relative to one another on their ability 
to satisfy the given criteria. 
Interpretation of Ratings  
For each criterion-alternative pair, a rating of 1 to 5 was assigned.  A lower number means 
the alternative is less favorable in terms of satisfying that particular criteria than another 
alternative.  While those with high scores were deemed to more favorably accomplish the 
goal of that particular criteria.  The meanings of the ratings for each criterion are described

Alternative Analysis for the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) 
Based on the analysis conducted above, the following describes the analysis of the 
alternatives.   
Alternatives Considered. 
DHS identified several operational alternative solutions to meet the need of biometric data 
collection at air and sea locations.  These alternatives only concentrated on the location of 
collection and the collecting entity.  Specific technological solutions were not taken into 
account.  The alternatives considered were: 
 (A) Carrier collection of biometrics at the departure check-in counter;  
 (B) DHS collection of biometrics at or near the departure check-in counter;  
 (C) DHS collection of biometrics at the security checkpoint;  
 (D) Carrier collection of biometrics at the international departure gate; or  
 (E) DHS collection of biometrics at or near the international departure gate. 
Additionally, use of random verification at the international departure gate to increase 
confidence of departure prior to manifest comparison was considered for the check-in 
counter and security checkpoint locations, but these solutions were not further analyzed as 
they built upon existing alternatives and did not stand alone as discrete solutions.  Other 
possible solutions were considered, such as biometric collection at off-port privately-
owned locations (e.g. hotels, storefronts, travel agencies), but not included into the 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-16
alternatives analysis due to security and logistical concerns on number of locations and 
ability to standardize processes.  For all alternatives, DHS assumed that the collecting entity 
would purchase, own, deploy, certify, and maintain all the biometric collection equipment 
and software. 
DHS compared the possible alternatives using identified criteria to determine a relative 
ranking of the alternatives.  The criteria included: confidence of departure; percentage of 
population captured; operational impacts to aliens, the carriers, and to DHS; conceptual 
financial burden to the carriers and DHS; need for additional network/connectivity; 
information technology (IT) security concerns; and privacy, and cost. 
 
a. Confidence of Departure. 
Confidence of departure measures the perceived ability to provide a level of confidence 
that the alien subject to US-VISIT processing who was submitting biometric information 
did, in fact, depart the United States.  The departure gate alternatives provided a higher 
level of confidence of departure regardless of the collecting entity.  If biometric collection 
occurs at the departure point, the ability for an alien to exit the port after submitting 
biometrics is very low and provides for a high confidence of departure.  Collection of 
biometrics at the check-in counter provides the lowest confidence of departure as the 
ability of an alien to depart the port, after submitting biometric data but prior to actual 
departure from, the United States is high.  The TSA security screening checkpoint was in 
between the other two locations considered.  In addition, random verification of aliens 
processed at the check-in counter provided a high level of confidence of departure. 
 
b. Percentage of Population Captured. 
Each alternative was measured for its ability to capture the biometric information from all 
aliens.  Where the alternative was located at a mandatory location for the alien, the 
percentage of population collected increases.  Since all aliens are processed at the departure 
gate or the security checkpoint, the alternatives located at the departure gates were most 
favorable regardless of collecting entity.  Since not every alien currently checks in at the 
check-in counter, these alternatives were slightly less favorable.   
 
c. Operational Impacts to the Alien, Carrier, and DHS. 
The alternatives were compared based on the expected additional time and/or additional 
process that the alien, carrier, or United States Government may experience for each 
implemented solution.  The rankings for operational impacts varied not only with location, 
but with the collecting entity as well.  Overall, the alternatives where existing processes 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-17
occur and an existing entity resides were more favorable than locations where no current 
process occurs or entity resides. 
Most aliens currently interface with the carrier at the check-in counter.  Therefore, 
operational impacts to the alien were most favorable for biometric collection by the carrier 
at the check-in counter.  In most cases, the alien is already providing identification and 
other information at the check-in counter.  A biometric collection can be taken in 
conjunction with these already existing processes at the counter without the alien 
experiencing additional processing time.  The remaining alternatives were less favorable to 
the alien due to the possible addition of time for that collection.  For example, although 
aliens already proceed through the security checkpoint and are processed by carriers at the 
departure gate, biometric collection at these locations would be an entirely separate 
process and could result in additional time.  Likewise, DHS collection at the check-in 
counter or departure gate adds a process where one currently does not exist and at a 
location through which the alien does not currently proceed. 
Currently, carriers process aliens at check-in counters and at the departure gate.  However, 
adding biometric collection at these locations will add a process for the carrier.  Therefore, 
the carrier collection alternatives rank lower than DHS collection.  If DHS collects the 
biometric information, the carrier will experience a much less significant change in their 
current operations. 
DHS has a presence at air and sea ports at the TSA security screening checkpoint, and, at 
international arrival airports, at the secure federal inspection service.  However, adding 
biometric collection at the security screening checkpoint was determined as unfavorable as 
the processes at the security screening checkpoint do not deal with identity management, 
but the screening of persons and luggage.  Biometric collection at the security screening 
checkpoint could not append an existing process but, rather, would add time as a new 
process altogether for aliens subject to US-VISIT.  Furthermore, DHS biometric collection at 
the check-in counter or departure gate would also add a process (and time) where none 
currently exists.  All DHS alternatives were deemed unfavorable to DHS due to the 
additional DHS processes while carrier alternatives were deemed favorable.  
 
d. Conceptual Financial Burden to the Carriers and DHS. 
The alternatives analysis assumed that the collecting entity would be responsible for the 
purchase, deployment, and maintenance of all biometric collection equipment and 
software needed.  Therefore, each alternative was compared based on the conceptual 
financial burden for the collecting entity to develop, deliver, and implement the solution.  
Accordingly, financial burden on the carriers was most favorable when DHS collected the 
biometrics and financial burden on DHS was most favorable when the carriers collected 
biometrics. 
 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-18
e. Need for Additional Network or Connectivity. 
Each alternative was analyzed for its potential need for the DHS-supplied local and wide 
area data communications infrastructure between the port and the IDENT system that is 
used to securely transport biometric information.  The carrier alternatives were moderately 
more favorable than the other alternatives since those locations have existing network and 
connectivity infrastructure, although biometric collection would have to be integrated into 
that process. 
 
f. IT security complexity. 
The alternatives were compared for the possibility that: (a) there would be unauthorized 
use or misuse of the equipment, data, or network; (b) equipment may be open to 
intentional or accidental compromise; (c) United States Government standards may not be 
implemented as specified; and/or (d) there would be intentional compromise of 
equipment, data, software, or communications infrastructure that would endanger the 
integrity of the biometric data collected.  The alternatives where carriers collected the 
biometric information were less favorable than the alternatives where DHS collected the 
biometric information, regardless of location.  Information in the sole custody of one 
entity has less possibility of being breached than information passed from one entity’s 
network to another’s.  The carrier collection alternatives require biometric information to 
pass between the carrier’s network and DHS’s network.  Comparatively, DHS is in sole 
custody of the biometric information at all times for the DHS collection alternatives. 
 
g. Privacy. 
The Privacy criteria looked at the likelihood of satisfying US-VISIT responsibility for 
compliance with the Privacy Act, the Homeland Security Act, the E-Government Act and 
applicable DHS and US-VISIT policies.  Successful compliance requires limiting the 
collection of PII, and securing the PII against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or 
retention, such as the use of the PII collected on behalf of the government for non-
government purposes.  Like the IT security complexity analysis, the carrier collection 
alternatives were less favorable than the DHS collection alternatives, regardless of location.  
When DHS does not maintain custody of PII throughout its lifecycle, there is a lower 
degree of confidence that its privacy principles will be followed than when DHS does 
maintain full custody over the PII.

h. Cost.119 
In examining each of the five alternatives listed, DHS developed a cost estimate for each.  
These cost estimates are more fully explained in relation to the Executive Order 12866 and 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, infra.  Alternatives C and E are expected to add additional 
significant labor costs relative to the other three alternatives, and thus would have these 
additional costs recurring beyond the first year: 
 Alternative A: Carrier biometric collection at check-in Counters: $949,000,000 
 Alternative B: DHS collection at check-in counters:   $357,000,000 
 Alternative C: DHS collection at TSA checkpoint:   $304,000,000 
 Alternative D: Carrier collection at aircraft gate:   $449,000,000 
 Alternative E: Government collection at aircraft gate:  $360,000,000 
 
After comparing the alternatives based on the identified criteria, DHS further screened the 
alternatives against five constraints.  These constraints were identified as important based 
on DHS goals and the evaluations of the US-VISIT biometric exit program pilot. 
The biometric exit solution must align with the Pre-Departure APIS Final Rule 
requirements.  DHS is working to align the many programs and requirements of its 
components.  DHS’s proposed APIS rule would enable it to collect passenger and crew 
information for flights and cruises bound for the U.S. prior to the carriers’ departure from 
foreign ports.  By aligning biometric collection requirements with the departure APIS data 
collection, DHS can streamline its requirements, thus promoting efficiency. 
Biometric data collection for aliens subject to US-VISIT must be associated with the 
issuance of a boarding pass. The issuance of a boarding pass only after an alien has 
provided the required biometric data is a means of ensuring alien compliance.  As 
identified in the US-VISIT biometric exit pilot evaluations, by integrating biometric 
requirements into an existing process, compliance will increase.  Placement of collection 
points outside of the existing departure process was a contributing factor towards low 
compliance during the biometric exit pilots, as it was easy for departing aliens to miss or 
bypass the collection point.   
                                               
119 These were preliminary cost estimates generated during the development of the Analysis of Alternatives 
and have been superseded, as scope and alternative refinement occurred, by later estimates in the body of the 
regulatory evaluation 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-20
Alien submission of biometric data will not generate a law enforcement action at the time 
of departure.  Biometric collection at exit will be used to validate the data against stored 
entry data; it will not result in a “no fly” decision.  APIS will continue to be used to 
address “no fly” issues.  However, biometric information may be used subsequent to exit 
for enforcement of immigration laws. 
The solution must be implemented in 2008 at United States commercial air and sea ports 
in order to meet legislative deadlines.  DHS is committed to meeting congressional 
mandates and preserving the Secretary’s authority granted by Congress in the Secure 
Transportation and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007. 
Of the alternatives, the only one to satisfy the constraints was carrier collection of 
biometrics for aliens at the departure check-in counter.  The first and second constraints 
are critical to understanding the decision to move forward with biometric collection 
placement at the carrier check-in counter.  The constraint that the exit solution be aligned 
with APIS collection provides a number of advantages: it allows the finger scan to more 
easily be associated with the relevant biographic (e.g.,. name) information; it provides the 
carriers with a single point of information collection during the departure process; and 
carriers can use the same data infrastructure for transmitting biometric exit data as they do 
for departure APIS biographic data.  In addition, as recommended from the US-VISIT 
biometric exit pilot evaluations, integrating biometrics into an existing process, like 
boarding pass issuance, improves compliance and provides consistency and integration that 
will ensure that each alien will have a record collected prior to departure.  The non-
selected alternatives failed to account for this notion of an integrated system in order to 
facilitate travel. 
In the case of travel by air, the majority of aliens proceed to the check-in counters to 
provide identification, have travel documents checked, check baggage, and/or have a 
boarding pass issued prior to departure.  The check-in counter is the most appropriate 
location to collect the biometric data as the issuance of a boarding pass is predicated on the 
collection of biometric data first and a traveler can not pass through the TSA screening 
checkpoint without a boarding pass.  Thus, DHS selected the departure check-in counters 
to be the preferred alternative for air exit requirements. 
Likewise, the check-in counters are the most appropriate location to collect the biometric 
data in the case of a cruise ship traveler.  All cruise ship passengers have their reservations 
validated, travel documents checked, and collected by some carriers, APIS data collected 
and transmitted, and on-board identification issued.  Thus, DHS selected the departure 
check-in counters to be the preferred alternative for sea exit requirements. 
 
Initial Down Selection to a Preferred Alternative 
Of the eight alternatives considered in this assessment, only two appear to satisfy the Of 
the eight alternatives considered in this assessment, only two appear to satisfy the 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project 
RIA 
Date: 04-17-2008  F-21
biometric collection constraints, as well as satisfy the remaining constraints.  These two 
alternatives are the following: 
• Alternative A:  At the Check-in Counter – Airline/Cruise line collection 
• Alternative F:  At Check-in Counter – Airline collection with verification at gate 
A more seamless departure process would be achieved if the in-scope traveler were to 
provide the biometric data at the check-in counter, where the boarding pass is issued, and 
to the same persons who issue boarding passes. 
A deployment strategy for the Air/Sea Biometric Exit solution could consider Alternative A 
in the initial deployment, with “verification at the departure gate” as a capability that 
could be included later. 
However, if any aspect of the constraints were modified, such as a different interpretation 
of the biometric collection constraint, then the assessment results described in Section 6 
would suggest alternatives more favorable to the new set of constraints. 
 
Further Evaluation and Selection of New Preferred Alternative 
Upon further reflection of the technical details of the APIS pre-departure system and TSA’s 
Secure Flight system, US-VISIT has further analyzed the modified its considered 
alternatives. 
APIS pre-departure and Secure Flight are biographic based programs designed to vet 
travelers against security criteria, with the possibility of subsequent denial of boarding 
privileges or law enforcement action.  However, only direct departing international flights 
have the ability to transmit APIS manifest information.  Thus, for DHS to integrate Air/Sea 
Biometric Exit into existing APIS program parameters, the scope of exit must be scaled 
back to impact only those carriers and ports with direct departing flights.  This would 
reduce the number of air carriers from approximately 247 to 138, and airports from 450 
to 122. 
By collecting biometrics at the carrier check-in counter, collection can be tied to the 
boarding pass issuance process.  However, approximately 23 percent of all international 
departing aliens leave through connecting flights.  This presents problems with biometric 
collection for that subpopulation, because the domestic airports (and possibly carriers) 
where they originally embark would not be equipped with the necessary biometric 
scanners and APIS transmission capabilities.  The efficiency of running this subpopulation 
through the carrier check-in counters at the final U.S. airport of departure will vary from 
port to port.  To address this issue, carriers will be allowed to choose the method that best 
suits their operations at the final port of departure to collect biometrics from aliens using 
connecting flights, so long as the biometrics are collected before boarding the final 
departure flight.  While this does remove biometrics from the boarding passes for that 
subpopulation, it will still be integrated within the boarding process.

These modifications will allow the Air/Sea Biometric Exit capability to integrate with APIS 
pre-departure and Secure Flight. 
This newly considered alternative became the preferred alternative based on the need to 
integrate a biometric exit solution with APIS pre-departure and Secure Flight: Alternative 
(I) Location at the carrier’s discretion, carriers collect, shown in Table G-3. It is assumed 
that since APIS transmission currently occurs either at the check-in counter or the 
departure gate, at a high-level analysis, Alternative (I) is merely a hybrid of Alternatives A, 
D, and F.  Therefore, the average scores for Alternatives A, D, and F were taken for 
Alternative I.

US-VISIT further chose to examine an associated alternative: Alternative (J) Location at the 
carrier’s discretion, government collects, shown in Table G-4.  Since the exit alternatives 
deal with the collection location and collecting entity, adding Alternative J, allows US-
VISIT to see a mirrored alternative to Alternative I.  Again, at the high-level, Alternative J is 
merely a hybrid of Alternatives B, E, and G.

Final Alternatives Down-Selection for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) 
In an effort to present a focused assessment of the most viable alternatives in the air/sea 
biometric exit NPRM, US-VISIT down-selected the seven high-level alternatives to three 
• Alternative I: Location at the carrier’s discretion, carrier collection (Preferred 
Alternative) 
• Alternative C: Security checkpoint, government collection 
• Alternative J: Location at the carrier’s discretion, government collection 
 
These three alternatives represent an assessment of all seven alternatives.  Alternative C is a 
discrete alternative.  It is assumed that the carrier’s discretion locations will be either the 
check-in counter and/or the departure gate.  Therefore, Alternatives I and J encompass 
Alternatives A, D, and F and Alternatives B, E, and G, respectively.  These three alternatives 
best represent viable air/sea biometric exit solutions and allow US-VISIT to present a more 
focused and detailed assessment within the NPRM.   
 
Revised Alternatives for the NPRM 
US-VISIT recognizes that its original, preferred alternative was Alternative A: Check-in 
counter, carriers collect.  This alternative was included in early stakeholder discussion and 
was discussed at length publicly.  US-VISIT decided to reevaluate the initial down selection 
due to the technical details of APIS and Secure Flight in addition to the fact that Alternative 
A proved to be an extremely expensive alternative to implement.  Thusly, US-VISIT 
declined to carry Alternative A forward to the NPRM.  Upon further reflection, US-VISIT 
has decided it will add Alternative A for further consideration in the NPRM.  Alternative A 
was the initial preferred alternative and was originally viewed as the most viable of all 
alternatives due to the current traveler process and current airport/sea port infrastructure.  
Therefore, US-VISIT is adding Alternative A into its NPRM for further comment in the 
rulemaking process. 
 
US-VISIT                                                                   Air/Sea Biometric Exit Project

In addition, US-VISIT recognizes that it piloted an approach to biometric collection at exit 
based on a kiosk solution.  This alternative has been publicized and tested and is 
considered a valid alternative to the proposed rule.  Therefore, US-VISIT is adding a Kiosk 
alternative into its NPRM for further comment in the rulemaking process.
