Executive Summary  
 
Overview   
 
 In 1984, Congress responded to the increasing threat to groundwater from leaking 
underground storage tank (UST) systems by adding Subtitle I to the Solid Waste Disposal Act 
(SWDA).  SWDA required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect the 
environment and human health from UST releases by developing a comprehensive regulatory 
program for UST systems storing petroleum or certain hazardous substances.  In 1986, Congress 
amended Subtitle I of SWDA and created the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund 
(LUST Trust Fund) to oversee and pay for cleanups at sites where the owner or operator is 
unknown, unwilling to pay, or unable to pay. 
 
 EPA promulgated the UST regulation in 1988 (40 CFR Part 280).  This regulation set 
minimum standards for new tanks and required owners and operators of existing tanks to 
upgrade, replace, or close them.  The 1988 regulation set deadlines for owners and operators to 
meet the new requirements.  In 1988, EPA also promulgated a regulation for state program 
approval (40 CFR Part 281).  EPA has not significantly changed these regulations since 1988.  In 
2005, the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) further amended Subtitle I of SWDA.  EPAct requires 
states that receive federal Subtitle I money from EPA to meet certain requirements.  EPA 
developed grant guidelines for states regarding operator training, inspections, delivery 
prohibition, secondary containment, financial responsibility for manufacturers and installers, 
public record, and state compliance reports on government UST systems.   
 
 After Congress passed EPAct, EPA decided to revise the 1988 UST regulation (at 40 
CFR Part 280), primarily to ensure parity in Indian country.  Key EPAct provisions (such as 
secondary containment and operator training) apply to all states receiving federal Subtitle I 
money, regardless of their state program approval status; but these key provisions do not apply in 
Indian country (or in states and U.S. territories that do not meet EPA’s operator training or 
secondary containment grant guidelines).  In order to establish federal UST requirements similar 
to the UST secondary containment and operator training requirements of EPAct, EPA decided to 
revise the 1988 UST regulation.  Without these changes, EPAct provisions will not apply in 
Indian country.  These proposed revisions will also fulfill the objectives of the EPA-Tribal UST 
Strategy (August 2006) in which both EPA and tribes recognized it is important to ensure parity 
in implementing UST program requirements in states and territories, as well as in Indian 
country.1   
 
EPA decided now is also an appropriate time to change the 1988 UST regulation.  While 
EPA has issued many guidance documents and used various implementation approaches and 
techniques over the last twenty years, we have not made significant changes to the original 1988 
regulation. Indeed, most states have passed requirements that go far beyond the original federal 
regulation.  These regulations fully implement provisions of the EPAct and improve important 
aspects of the existing (outdated) regulations.  Furthermore, while information on sources and 
causes of releases show that releases from tanks are less common than they once were, releases 
                                                          
1 See http://www.epa.gov./oust/fedlaws/Tribal%20Strategy_08076r.pdf 
  ES-2 
from piping and spills and overfills associated with deliveries have emerged as more common 
problems.2  Releases at the dispenser have also emerged as one of the leading sources of 
releases.  The lack of proper operation and maintenance of UST systems is a main cause of 
release from these areas. The proposed revisions focus on ensuring equipment is properly 
maintained and working, and highlight the importance of operating and maintaining UST 
equipment so releases are prevented and detected early in order to avoid or minimize potential 
soil and groundwater contamination.  
 
EPA worked diligently to ensure our proposed regulation development process was open 
and transparent.  Over a two year period, we provided all stakeholders – state and tribal 
regulators; federal facilities; petroleum industry members, including representatives of owners 
and operators; equipment manufacturers; small businesses; local governments; and 
environmental and community groups – an opportunity to share their ideas and concerns through 
a variety of meetings, conference calls, and email exchanges.  EPA thoroughly considered all 
input as we developed the proposed UST regulation changes. 
 
Proposed Regulatory Changes  
 
EPA is proposing to revise the 1988 UST regulation in order to: establish federal 
requirements similar to certain key provisions of the EPAct; ensure owners and operators 
perform proper operation and maintenance; address deferrals; update the regulation to current 
technology and practices; and make technical and editorial corrections.  Specifically, EPA is 
proposing these revisions (hereafter the Preferred Option):  
 
• Establish federal requirements for secondary containment and operator training 
similar to those established by the EPAct for states that receive federal Subtitle I 
money  
 
• Add operation and maintenance requirements  
o Walkthrough inspections  
o Spill prevention equipment tests  
o Overfill prevention equipment tests  
o Interstitial integrity tests  
o Operability tests for release detection methods  
 
• Address existing 40 CFR 280 deferrals   
o Require release detection for emergency generator UST systems  
o Remove deferrals and regulate airport hydrant fuel distribution systems 
(AHFDSs) and UST systems with field-constructed tanks (FCTs) with 
alternate release detection requirements  
o Remove deferrals for wastewater treatment tanks

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Underground Storage Tanks, “Petroleum Releases at Underground 
Storage Tank Facilities in Florida,” draft, March 2005. 
  ES-3 
 
• Provide for other changes to improve release prevention and detection and 
program implementation   
o Require testing after repairs to spill and overfill prevention equipment, and 
interstices  
o Eliminate flow restrictors in vent lines as an overfill prevention option for 
all new tanks and when overfill devices are replaced  
o Require closure of lined tanks that cannot be repaired according to a code 
of practice  
o Address responses to interstitial monitoring alarms  
o Notification requirement of ownership change   
o Eliminate groundwater and vapor monitoring as release detection methods  
o Establish requirements for determining compatibility  
 
• Make general updates to the regulation    
o Reference newer technologies, including explicitly adding statistical 
inventory reconciliation (SIR) and continuous in-tank leak detection 
(CITLD) as release detection methods  
o Update codes of practice listed in the regulation   
o Remove old upgrade and implementation deadlines   
o Make editorial and technical corrections  
 
• Revise state program approval (40 CFR Part 281) to be consistent with the above 
revisions   
 
In addition to the Preferred Option, EPA considered two other regulatory alternatives, 
described as Alternative 1 and Alternative 2.  Alternative 1 is overall more stringent than the 
Preferred Option.  Alternative 2 is overall less stringent than the Preferred Option.  Exhibit ES-1 
summarizes the requirements under each alternative.   
 
EPA designed this assessment to satisfy the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) 
requirements for regulatory review under Executive Order 12866 (as amended by Executive 
Order 13258), which applies to any significant regulatory action.  This document also fulfills 
these requirements: 
 
• Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended by Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996  
• Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in 
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations  
• Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks 
and Safety Risks  
• Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  
• Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
• Executive Order 13132, Federalism

• Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect 
Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

Summary of Findings   
 
Within the constraints of data availability, EPA in this analysis identified all quantifiable 
and qualitative impacts for this proposed rule.  EPA obtained sufficient data to identify, by state, 
the number of units likely to be affected by each proposed change in the proposed rule.  In our 
analysis, we used these data to assess the compliance costs imposed upon units and relevant state 
governments.  In conducting these analyses, EPA also assessed the sensitivity of outcomes to key 
assumptions.  Separately, the analysis monetizes a number of impacts of the proposed rule 
including:  avoided costs generated by avoided releases; reduction in severity of releases; 
avoided product loss; avoided vapor intrusion damages; and a subset of human health benefits. 
  ES-5 
This analysis quantifies, but does not value, groundwater impacts.  Finally, due to data and 
resource limitations, EPA in this analysis was unable to quantify or value a subset of human 
health benefits and ecological impacts, but addressed these qualitatively.  
 
 In addition to identifying costs and positive impacts, EPA in this analysis also examined 
the economic and distributional impacts of the proposed rule.  The economic impact analysis 
includes the proposed rule’s effect on facility closures, employment, and energy output and cost.  
In the analysis of the proposed rule’s distributional impacts, we examined small business 
impacts, effects on minority and low-income populations, impacts on children’s health, and 
potential impacts on state financial assurance funds.  Finally, EPA’s analysis considered the 
proposed rule’s impacts related to certain executive orders and statutes, including Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act, tribal governments, and federalism.   
 
The main conclusions of this analysis are: 
 
• Compliance costs3 – EPA estimated $210 million in annual compliance costs for 
the proposed rule.  Costs range from approximately $130 million under 
Alternative 2 to $520 million under Alternative 1. 
• State and local government costs – Annual state and local government costs, 
including compliance costs to UST systems owned or operated by state and local 
governments, state program approval costs, and state costs for processing 
ownership changes, and one-time notifications for previously deferred systems are 
approximately $9 million.  These range from approximately $7 million under 
Alternative 2 to $19 million under Alternative 1.4  
• Avoided costs – Avoided remediation costs form the majority of positive impacts 
from the proposed rule.  EPA estimated the proposed rule will avoid total costs of 
$300 million per year to $740 million per year under the Preferred Option. This 
includes:  $300 million to $700 million in avoided remediation costs from avoided 
releases and avoided groundwater contamination incidents; $0.4 million to $26 
million in avoided vapor intrusion remediation costs; and approximately $2 
million to $7 million in avoided product loss.  Total avoided costs range from 
$310 million to $770 million under Alternative 1 and from $110 million to $590 
million under Alternative 2. 
                                                          
3 Compliance costs include direct compliance costs and state oversight costs.  For this regulatory impact analysis, 
direct compliance costs and state oversight costs provide a reasonable proxy to assess the proposed rule’s social 
costs.  See Chapter 3.1 for further discussion. 
4 If all applicable state and local government costs were incurred in the first year, rather than annualized and 
discounted, state and local governments would incur approximately $7 million in costs under the Preferred Option.  
This includes $0.9 million for states to apply for state program approval and to read the regulations, $0.6 million for 
states to process one-time notifications of EGTs, AHFDSs, and FCTs, and ownership changes that occur in the first 
year, and $5.6 million for state and local government owners and operators of UST systems to comply with 
requirements that come into effect in the first year (approximately 47% of which would be for state and local 
government owners and operators to read the proposed regulation).  
  ES-6 
• Benefits – Due to data and resource constraints, EPA only quantified human 
health benefits from avoided benzene-related cancer and was unable to quantify 
or monetize many of the proposed rule’s benefits.  The benefits from avoided 
benzene-related cancer total less than $5,000 per year.  In addition, EPA 
estimated the proposed rule could potentially protect 110 billion to 350 billion 
gallons of groundwater each year.5  Categories of nonmonetizable or 
nonquantifiable benefits that are qualitatively discussed in this analysis include:  
avoidance of nonbenzene health risks, mitigation of acute exposure events and 
large-scale releases (e.g., releases from airport hydrant fuel distribution systems 
and UST systems with field-constructed tanks6), and protection of ecological 
biota. 
• Compliance costs and avoided costs under the alternative baseline – Under the 
alternative baseline scenario that assumes declines in the universes of both UST 
systems and releases over time, EPA estimated $200 million in annual compliance 
costs for the proposed rule. Annual compliance costs in the alternative baseline 
scenario range from $120 million under Alternative 2 to $510 million under 
Alternative 1. EPA also estimated total avoided costs of $180 million to $440 
million under the Preferred Option in the alternative baseline scenario. These 
avoided costs range from $64 million to $360 million under Alternative 2 to $180 
million to $460 million under Alternative 1.  
• Average economic impacts – Motor fuel retailers, which account for roughly 80 
percent of UST systems, are expected to bear approximately 70 percent of the 
total costs under the Preferred Option.  To establish how the proposed rule may 
impact the market, EPA examined whether it imposes a cost greater than the 
average after-tax profit margin of 1.5 percent for motor fuel retailers.7  Using this 
benchmark, we estimate approximately 560 firms may exit the market if they 
cannot pass costs through to customers.  This number represents less than one 
percent of the total universe of facilities.8  
• State financial assurance funds – Decreases in release frequency and severity may 
decrease payments required of state financial assurance funds by $150 million per 
year or more under the Preferred Option. To the extent that these funds are 
                                                          
5 See chapter 4.10 for details on how this estimate was derived. 
6 For example, an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 gallons of fuel was released from a 2.1 million gallon underground 
field-constructed tank at a fuel depot in Portsmouth, VA.  Free product was found within 20 feet of a nearby creek in 
1987.  The release was attributed to tank and/or piping failures.  Another example is Pease Air Force Base, where jet 
fuel was delivered to the runway apron via an underground fueling system.  Historical leakage from the system 
contaminated soil and groundwater, forming groundwater plumes at many sites along the system.  A site release 
study identified 60 to 70 release points with varying degrees of severity along the refueling system line with free 
product found under the apron at closure. 
  
7 When costs exceed facility profits, it is likely that in the long-term, the facility would exit the market. 
 
8 In comparison, between 2005 and 2008, the number of gas station facilities decreased an average of 1.4 percent per 
year (or 2,400 stations per year). 
  ES-7 
maintained by taxes other than those assessed on UST operators, decreases in 
these payments effectively represent a reallocation of costs from public entities to 
the private entities responsible for releases.   
 
Assessment of Compliance Costs   
 
For this regulatory impact analysis, direct compliance costs and state oversight costs 
provide a reasonable proxy to assess the proposed rule’s social costs for the following reasons:  
 
• The regulatory requirements generally focus on additional testing and inspection 
of existing equipment and do not reflect large-scale investments in equipment or 
significant changes to operations at the facility level.  In addition, the facilities 
affected by the proposed rule are distributed with relative geographic uniformity 
for consumers and producers.  
 
• Given the relatively small facility costs of less than $900 per year for the average 
facility, closures or changes in market structure represent an unlikely response to 
the proposed rule.  According to the 2002 Economic Census, average revenues in 
the retail motor fuel sales sector were approximately $2.1 million; the 
corresponding cost-to-sales ratio for the average facility is less than one-tenth of 
one percent. Therefore, it is unlikely significant changes to production or 
consumer behavior will affect social costs.  
 
• The short- and long-run impacts of the proposed rule are not likely to differ 
significantly.  Testing and inspection requirements may offer some opportunities 
for owners and operators to reduce costs by learning over time, but they are not 
likely to reduce costs enough to facilitate large-scale equipment upgrades.  
 
EPA’s calculation of total incremental compliance costs for UST facilities reflects two 
key components:  identifying specific measures necessary for compliance at individual facilities 
and calculating costs associated with each of these measures.  To estimate these costs, EPA 
developed a compliance cost model that identifies incremental equipment and labor requirements 
for an individual system.  Based on the baseline equipment use profile, existing state regulations, 
and anticipated responses to the proposed regulation, the model then generates system-specific 
estimates of compliance costs.  Compliance costs include labor and capital costs associated with 
new equipment and installation, inspection, testing, and recordkeeping.  The model also includes 
other compliance costs, such as those associated with more frequent detection of equipment 
failure and repair of equipment.  Some component costs are specific to individual UST system 
configurations – for example, airport hydrant fuel distribution systems or UST systems with 
field-constructed tanks – while others are consistent across all system types.  Exhibit ES-2 
summarizes the findings of our analysis of compliance costs.

Assessment of Benefits and Cost Savings  
 
Avoided remediation costs provide the basis for a substantial portion of the beneficial 
impacts associated with the proposed rule.  Avoided remediation costs of the proposed rule 
represent cost savings that accrue to owners, operators, and public entities charged with 
remediating releases at regulated facilities.  EPA obtained remediation costs from a survey of 
state leaking UST programs and estimates of the distribution of releases by UST system area 
from internal research.9  EPA identified five UST technical experts who provided professional 
judgment regarding the proposed rule’s effects on reduction in release frequency (number of 
releases per year) and release severity (as measured by groundwater incidents averted).  This 
body of knowledge allowed EPA to estimate total avoided costs, as well as avoided costs per 
requirement.  EPA also estimated avoided costs associated with vapor intrusion and product loss, 
though these avoided costs are not allocated across requirements.10   
 
In addition to avoided costs, the analysis monetized avoided benzene cancer risks from 
avoided contaminated groundwater and quantified volume of groundwater protected.  These 
benefits assume that exposure risk is eliminated at the time of discovery and cleanup, and are

Tank Systems – Peer Review Draft, U.S. EPA, August 2004. 
 
10 These costs were not allocated because we did not ask the experts to estimate quantitatively how different 
regulatory requirements would specifically affect vapor intrusion or product loss.  Vapor intrusion frequency and 
cost data rely on general information we received from several states, and are typically recorded as additional 
remedial activities at some groundwater sites.  The likelihood of vapor intrusion, however, is driven by proximity of 
receptors and by geology, and is not predictably related to the size or age of a plume.   Product loss estimates rely on 
data from Florida and other sources for typical release sizes and are mapped to the estimates of avoided releases.

therefore additive to avoided cleanup costs. Finally, the analysis provided a qualitative 
discussion of avoided acute events and exposure (including large-scale releases, such as those 
from airport hydrant fuel distribution systems and UST systems with field-constructed tanks), 
ecological benefits, and avoided nonbenzene human health risks. These findings are summarized 
in Exhibit ES-3 below.

Comparison of Compliance Costs and Positive Impacts   
 
Exhibit ES-4 summarizes the compliance costs and positive impacts of the proposed rule.  
The majority of measurable positive effects occur as avoided remediation costs.   Monetized 
social benefits occur only in the form of avoided cancer cases from groundwater contamination 
and constitute only a very small part of overall effects.  Nevertheless, as discussed in Chapter 4, 
avoided costs provide a reasonable measure of the positive effects of the proposed rule.

Exhibit ES-5 summarizes the compliance costs and positive impacts of the proposed rule 
under an alternative baseline where universes of UST systems and releases are assumed to 
decrease at a declining rate over time.  Compliance costs decline slightly under the alternative

costs decline by approximately 40 percent, as the universe of releases contracts substantially 
under the alternative baseline.

Economic Impacts  
 
EPA’s assessment of the economic impacts associated with this proposed rule focused on 
the retail motor fuels sector, which accounts for approximately 80 percent of UST owners or 
operators.  In this analysis, EPA described supply and demand dynamics within the retail motor 
fuels market and the likely economic responses to increased compliance costs.  Our screening 
assessment found that average estimated facility-level costs of $890 may result in the market exit 
of approximately 560 facilities, if these facilities cannot pass any regulatory costs through to 
customers.  This represents less than half of one percent of existing retail motor fuel facilities, 
and an even smaller fraction of all facilities affected by the proposed rule.  
 
To address uncertainty related to the distribution of costs among UST facilities, we also 
presented a worst case sensitivity analysis, which identified the maximum number of facilities 
that could face significant economic impacts due to regulatory costs.  We defined the worst case 
as the scenario where the highest possible cost occurred for the smallest facilities. We found that 
up to 6,100 facilities (roughly four percent of existing retail motor fuel facilities) may exit the 
market in this unlikely worst-case scenario.  The limited magnitude of impacts even in the worst 
case scenario suggest that the proposed rule will not affect existing consolidation trends in the 
retail motor fuels industry, or retail motor fuel prices or consumption. 
 
In addition, EPA’s analysis suggests that the proposed rule could result in a reallocation 
of costs from the public to private parties responsible for releases.11  The prevention of releases 
under this rule would increase compliance costs to facility owners, but the avoided releases 
                                                          
11 For additional information regarding this issue, see Chapter 5. 
  ES-12 
would in many cases reduce remediation demand for taxpayer-funded state funds. This is likely 
to improve behavioral incentives, as the parties most likely to cause releases will also be 
responsible for preventing them.  As discussed in Chapter 5, this reallocation could result in 
savings to state financial assurance funds in excess of $150 million per year.  
 
Other Regulatory and Distributional Issues   
 
 As part of our analysis, we also assessed the proposed rule’s potential impacts related to:  
 
• Energy impacts – The proposed rule will not have significant adverse effects on energy 
supply, distribution, or use, including impacts on price and foreign supplies.  It is, 
therefore, not a significant energy action under Executive Order 13211, Actions 
Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use 
(May 18, 2001).  
 
• Regulatory flexibility – EPA’s analysis determined that approximately 1,350 small 
entities (roughly one percent of the universe of affected small entities) may experience 
economic impacts that exceed one percent of revenues.  For various reasons, and 
especially due to different system configurations for smaller facilities, the actual number 
of affected entities is likely to be even fewer than the number estimated by the analysis.  
In comparison, this number is smaller than the recent industry consolidation rate of 
approximately 2,400 facilities per year in the retail motor fuels sector. The proposed rule 
is unlikely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
businesses or small governments. 
 
• Small government impacts – The proposed rule is not expected to have significant small 
government impacts.  EPA’s assessment of costs to state and local governments indicated 
that no government-owned UST facilities will experience costs that exceed one percent of 
revenues.  
 
• Impacts on minority and low-income populations – Because the proposed rule would 
increase regulatory stringency and reduce the number and size of releases, the proposed 
rule is not expected to have any disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental effects on minority or low income populations, or on any community.  
 
• Children’s health protection –While the risk assessment did not specifically measure 
exposure to children, adults are the more sensitive receptor for cancer effects of 
contaminated groundwater due to the longer potential exposure from showering 
(inhalation of vapors) compared to children (ingestion of water while bathing), 
particularly those under five who are assumed to take more baths and fewer showers.  
Therefore, EPA has no reason to believe that the proposed rule would have a 
disproportionate environmental health risk effect on children, as defined in Executive 
Order 13045, Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks 
(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). Moreover, because the proposed rule is expected to 
reduce exposure to contaminated groundwater by reducing the number and size of 
releases, EPA does not expect the proposed rule to have any adverse impact on children.  
  ES-13 
 
• Regulatory planning and review – Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866 [58 
FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], EPA determined the proposed rule is an economically 
significant regulatory action because it may have an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more, as defined in section 3(f)(1) of the order.  Findings of the 
regulatory cost analysis in Chapter 3 indicate the rule, as proposed, is projected to result 
in aggregate annual compliance costs of approximately $210 million under the Preferred 
Option, $520 million under Alternative 1, and $130 million under Alternative 2.  
 
• Unfunded mandates analysis – The proposed rule is subject to the requirements of 
sections 202 and 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) because it 
contains federal mandates that may result in the expenditure by state, local, and tribal 
governments or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any one year.  Exhibit 
ES-6 provides references for EPA’s analyses responding to UMRA requirements under 
which this proposed rule is subject.

• Federalism – Executive Order 13132, Federalism (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), 
defines policies that have federalism implications to include regulations with substantial 
direct effects on states, on the relationship between the national government and states, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  
EPA typically considers a policy to have federalism implications if it results in aggregate 
expenditures by state and/or local governments of $25 million or more in any one year. 
As Exhibit ES-7 below indicates, EPA does not expect any of the proposed options to 
have significant federalism implications.

• Tribal governments analysis – Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination 
With Indian Governments (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), requires EPA to develop a 
process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of 
regulatory policies that have tribal implications.  EPA consulted with tribal officials early 
in the process of developing this proposed regulation to welcome meaningful and timely 
input into its development.  EPA began its consultation with tribes on possible changes to 
the UST regulation shortly after the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  In 
addition to our early consultation with tribes, EPA also reached out again to tribes as we 
started the official rulemaking process and throughout the development of this proposed 
rule.  EPA sent letters to leaders of over 500 tribes as well as to tribal regulatory staff to 
invite their participation in the development of the regulation.  EPA heard from both 
tribal officials who work as regulators as well as representatives of owners and operators 
of UST systems in Indian country.  The tribal regulators raised concerns about ensuring 
parity of environmental protection between states and Indian country.  Today’s proposed 
changes to the UST regulation are needed to ensure parity between UST systems in states 
and in Indian country.  This regulation will ensure installed equipment is working 
properly to protect the environment from potential releases.   
 
As part of this analysis, EPA concluded the proposed rule will have tribal implications to 
the extent that tribally-owned entities with UST systems on Indian country would be 
affected.  However, it will neither impose substantial direct compliance costs on tribal 
governments, nor preempt tribal law.  Total costs to owners and operators of tribally-
owned UST systems are approximately $0.7 million.  
 
• Joint impacts of rules – Facilities in the UST system universe are affected by a number of 
existing regulations, including state regulations and Spill Prevention, Control, and 
Countermeasure (SPCC) rules.  At the time of the 1988 UST regulation, completely 
buried tanks greater than 42,000 gallons and located near navigable waters of the U.S. or 
adjoining shorelines were subject to both UST rules and SPCC rules. Since then, SPCC 
rules have been amended and the rule exempts completely buried storage tanks, as well 
as connected underground piping, underground ancillary equipment, and containment 
systems, when subject to the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 280.  In today's 
proposal, EPA proposes to continue to defer the aboveground components associated 
with airport hydrant systems and USTs with field-constructed tanks.  These aboveground 
  ES-15 
components will be subject to SPCC requirements.  EPA is proposing to regulate the 
underground components associated with airport hydrant systems and USTs with field-
constructed tanks.  Once the proposal becomes final, these underground components will 
no longer be subject to SPCC requirements.  In addition, previously deferred wastewater 
treatment tank systems and UST systems that store fuel solely for use by emergency 
power generators will now be regulated under the UST regulation and will no longer be 
subject to SPCC.  EPA does not believe the proposed rule creates a serious inconsistency 
or interferes with any other actions planned or undertaken by other agencies.

Chapter 1.  Introduction 
This document presents an analysis by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) of the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of 
the proposed targeted changes to the Underground Storage Tank (UST) regulations.  The 
proposed rule serves the purpose of strengthening the existing underground storage tank 
regulations by increasing the emphasis on proper operation and maintenance of UST systems and 
improved maintenance of release detection equipment.  The proposed changes also acknowledge 
improvements in technology over the last twenty years, including the ability to perform release 
detection for many tank systems that were previously deferred. 
1.1  Background  
 In 1984, Congress responded to the increasing threat to groundwater from leaking 
underground storage tank (UST) systems by adding Subtitle I to the Solid Waste Disposal Act 
(SWDA).  SWDA required EPA to protect the environment and human health from UST releases 
by developing a comprehensive regulatory program for UST systems storing petroleum or 
certain hazardous substances.  In 1986, Congress amended Subtitle I of SWDA and created the 
Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (LUST Trust Fund) to oversee and pay for 
cleanups at sites where the owner or operator is unknown, unwilling to pay, or unable to pay. 
 
 EPA promulgated the UST regulation in 1988 (40 CFR Part 280).  This regulation set 
minimum standards for new tanks and required owners and operators of existing tanks to 
upgrade, replace, or close them.  The 1988 regulation set deadlines for owners and operators to 
meet the new requirements.  By 1998, owners and operators had to meet new UST system 
requirements, upgrade their existing UST systems, or close them.  Owners and operators who 
chose to upgrade had to ensure that every UST system had spill prevention equipment (e.g., spill 
buckets), overfill prevention equipment, and was protected from corrosion.  In addition, owners 
and operators were required to monitor their UST systems for releases using release detection 
(phased in in the 1990s depending on the year of installation of each UST system).  Finally, 
owners and operators were required to have financial responsibility (phased in through 1998) to 
ensure that they are financially able to pay for any releases that occur.  No significant changes 
have been made to these requirements since 1988. 
 
 In 1988, EPA also promulgated a regulation for state program approval (40 CFR Part 
281).  Since states are the primary implementers of the UST program, EPA wanted to set up a 
process where state programs could operate in lieu of the federal program if certain requirements 
were met.  This regulation describes the minimum requirements states must meet to have their 
regulations operate in lieu of the federal regulation. 
 
 In 2005, the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) further amended Subtitle I of SWDA.  The 
EPAct requires states that receive federal Subtitle I money from EPA to meet certain 
requirements.  EPA developed grant guidelines for states regarding operator training, 
inspections, delivery prohibition, secondary containment, financial responsibility for 
*** E.O. 12866 Review - Draft - Do Not Cite, Quote or Release During Review *** 
 
 1-2 
manufacturers and installers, public record and state compliance reports on government UST 
systems.   
 
1.2 Need for Regulatory Action 
 
 After Congress passed EPAct, EPA decided to revise the 1988 UST regulation (at 40 
CFR Part 280), primarily to ensure parity in Indian country.  Key EPAct provisions (such as 
secondary containment and operator training) apply to all states receiving federal Subtitle I 
money, regardless of their state program approval status; but these key provisions do not apply in 
Indian country (or in states and U.S. territories that do not meet EPA’s operator training or 
secondary containment grant guidelines).  In order to establish federal UST requirements similar 
to the UST secondary containment and operator training requirements of EPAct, EPA decided to 
revise the 1988 UST regulation.  Without these changes, EPAct provisions will not apply in 
Indian country.  These proposed revisions will also fulfill the objectives of the EPA-Tribal UST 
Strategy (August 2006) in which both EPA and tribes recognized it is important to ensure parity 
in implementing UST program requirements in states and territories, as well as in Indian 
country.1   
 
 EPA decided now is also an appropriate time to change the 1988 UST regulation.  While 
EPA has issued many guidance documents and used various implementation approaches and 
techniques over the last twenty years, we have not made significant changes to the original 1988 
regulation. Indeed, most states have passed requirements that go far beyond the original federal 
regulation. 
 
Furthermore, while information on sources and causes of releases show that releases from 
tanks are less common than they once were, releases from piping and spills and overfills 
associated with deliveries have emerged as more common problems.2  In addition, releases at the 
dispenser have emerged as one of the leading sources of releases.  The lack of proper operation 
and maintenance of UST systems is a main cause of release from these areas.  Data also indicate 
that release detection only detects about one quarter of all releases.3  While some of those 
releases occur in areas not required to have release detection, other releases that should be 
detected are not because of problems with the operation and maintenance of the release detection 
equipment.

required (and therefore is not designed to detect a release).  Of the 50 percent that should be detected, 25 percent still 
go undetected partly because of issues with operation and maintenance of the release detection equipment.  (Office

Since the beginning of the UST program, preventing petroleum releases into the 
environment has been one of the primary goals of the program. EPA and our partners have made 
major progress in reducing the number of new releases, but over 7,000 releases are still 
discovered each year. Because existing publicly-funded mechanisms and institutions frequently 
cover at least part of the costs of release remediation, owners and operators of UST systems do 
not bear the full costs of their actions.4 Petroleum releases thus represent a negative externality 
caused by UST system operators, as the individuals and firms that cause releases do not bear 
their full costs. This represents a failure of the market to fully internalize the cost to society of 
operating an UST system: private costs do not equal social costs. A combination of revised 
technical standards and inspection and testing requirements represents the most appropriate 
method for reducing the number of future releases and mitigating the impact of existing negative 
externalities. 
 
 EPA wanted to make sure the rule development process was open and transparent and 
that all stakeholders had an opportunity to share their ideas as well as their concerns.  From the 
beginning of this process, EPA recognized the concerns about costs on owners and operators and 
was committed to limiting the requirements for retrofits.  We reached out to all stakeholders, 
including state and tribal regulators, federal facilities, members of the petroleum industry 
including representatives of owners and operators as well as equipment manufacturers, small 
businesses, local governments, and environmental and community groups.  Over a two-year 
period, we held conference calls, solicited comments and gave stakeholders multiple 
opportunities to share their ideas as well as kept them informed of where we were in the process.   
 
 From this extensive stakeholder outreach, EPA compiled potential proposed changes to 
the UST regulations.  EPA shared all of these ideas with the stakeholders and gave them an 
opportunity to comment on each idea that was submitted to us.  We then revised and added items 
to the list as necessary based on data, analysis and consideration of costs and benefits.  
Ultimately, EPA identified the items in this proposed rule as the needed regulatory changes at 
this time. 
 
1.3  Summary of the Proposed Rule 
EPA is proposing to revise the UST regulations in order to: establish federal requirements 
that are similar to certain key provisions of the Energy Policy Act; ensure owners and operators 
perform proper operation and maintenance; address deferrals; update the regulations to current 
technology and practices; and make technical and editorial corrections.  Specifically, EPA is 
proposing the following set of revisions (hereafter referred to as the Preferred Option): 
                                                          
4 We refer here to mechanisms other than those whose specific purpose is to fund remediation for new 
releases from UST systems. For example, if owners and operators in a particular state are compelled to participate in 
a fund operated by a public (or private) entity, and the contributions made directly by the owners and operators are 
equal to all the remediation costs, such a policy overcomes the market failure. However, if taxpayers are required to 
cover any portion of remediation costs through general funds or revenues obtained for other purposes, the negative 
externality will not be rectified.

1.4  Alternative Regulatory Options 
In addition to assessing the impacts of the Preferred Option, this document assesses the 
costs, benefits, and economic impacts of two regulatory alternatives, as outlined in Exhibit 1-1. 
Please refer to the preamble for a discussion on the rationale behind the development of these 
two alternatives.  
Under each of these alternatives, EPA evaluated variations of a subset of the proposed 
changes, while some of the proposed regulatory requirements remained in effect across all 
options.  The differences between the three regulatory options considered in this regulatory 
impact analysis are described in Exhibit 1-1.

 1-6 
 Note that each option considered by EPA contains a set of new requirements that does 
not vary across options. As explained in the introduction, operator training and secondary 
containment are being proposed in order to ensure parity in program implementation among 
states and in Indian country.  Therefore, these requirements are necessary across all options.  
Based on input EPA received from stakeholders, EPA believes the other proposed requirements 
in this set represent the minimum necessary changes for its proposed rule. Specifically, these 
requirements are: 
• Testing after repairs to spill and overfill prevention equipment, and interstitial 
spaces 
• Adding SIR/CITLD to regulations with performance criteria 
• Reporting and testing for interstitial alarms 
• Removing the deferral for release detection for emergency generator tanks 
• Notification of ownership change 
• Closure of lined tanks that cannot be repaired according to a code of practice 
• Requirements for determining compatibility, and 
• Requiring operator training and secondary containment 
Many of the requirements proposed in this rule will not immediately impose new costs 
upon UST owners or operators. For example, new requirements for periodic testing of equipment 
do not require owners or operators to perform those tests at the time the rule comes into effect; 
depending on the requirement, they may have up to three years to satisfy the new requirements.5 
EPA’s analysis accounts for this delay in its estimate of costs by discounting the costs associated 
with each requirement as shown in Exhibit 1-2. EPA assumes that the monetized positive 
impacts associated with these requirements accrue at the end of the year in which costs occur to 
incorporate an assumption that some beneficial impacts may lag requirements.6 
                                                          
5 Please refer to the preamble section for each proposed requirement for a discussion on the rationale 
behind the delayed or phase-in implementation periods. 
6 EPA does not have data to suggest any particular length of lag for each requirement; for this analysis, we 
effectively assume that benefits accrue at the end of the year in which costs occur. Chapters 3 and 4 provide detailed 
descriptions of the methods used to assess costs and beneficial impacts.

Please refer to the preamble section for each proposed requirement for a discussion on 
the rationale behind the delayed or phase-in implementation periods. 
 
Finally, EPA is including a set of proposed revisions and clarifications that are not 
expected to have any economic impact, due either to the nature of the requirement or to the 
interaction of UST regulations with existing regulations.  The only cost associated with these 
clarifications and changes is the cost of reading the new regulations.  These revisions include: 
• Removing deferrals for wastewater treatment tanks9 
                                                          
7 As part of this analysis, we assume that overfill prevention equipment tests and interstitial integrity tests 
will begin after a three-year delay.  Phasing in these costs over a three-year period would increase total costs by 
approximately $5.1 million compared to a three-year delay; this does not affect the total cost estimate presented in 
the RIA for the proposed rule. 
 
8 Removing deferrals for airport hydrant fuel distribution systems and field-constructed tanks will require 
these systems to comply with Subparts B, C, D, E, G, and H of 40 CFR Part 280. The proposed regulation requires 
these systems to comply with Subparts B, C, and D after 3 years, while compliance with Subparts E, G, and H 
would be required immediately. 
9 While this represents a new requirement, based on conversations with the Georgia Environmental 
Protection Division, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), Highland Tank, and the 
Automobile Recyclers Association, EPA believes that all active wastewater treatment tanks, including tanks at most 
publicly owned treatment works and many private treatment facilities, are currently regulated by either section 402 
or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act and therefore excluded from 40 CFR 280.  As a result, EPA believes that 
there are no wastewater treatment tank systems currently deferred.  Therefore, we assume that the removal of the 
deferral will have no impact on the regulated universe.

• Updating the regulations to reference newer technologies 
• Updating the codes of practice listed  in the regulations 
• Updating the regulations to remove old upgrade and implementation deadlines 
• Updating the regulations for editorial and technical corrections, and 
• Revising the State Program Approval (40 CFR Part 281) regulations to be

1.5  Scope of Analysis 
 Within the constraints of data availability, this analysis attempts to capture all 
quantifiable and qualitative impacts for this proposed rule. EPA obtained sufficient data to 
identify, by state, the number of units likely to be affected by each proposed change in the rule. 
The analysis uses these data to assess the compliance costs on these units and relevant state 
governments. In conducting these analyses, EPA also assessed the sensitivity of outcomes to key 
assumptions.  Separately, the analysis monetizes a number of impacts of the rule, including the 
avoided costs generated by avoided releases, reduction in severity of releases, avoided product 
loss, avoided vapor intrusion damages, and a subset of human health benefits. This analysis 
quantifies, but does not value, groundwater impacts. Finally, this analysis is unable to quantify or 
value a subset of human health benefits and ecological impacts, but addresses these qualitatively. 
 
 In addition to identifying costs and the positive impacts of the rule, this analysis also 
examines the economic and distributional impacts of the rule. The economic impact analysis 
includes the proposed rule’s effect on facility closures, employment, and energy output and cost. 
The analysis of the distributional impacts of the rule examines the effect of a reduction in 
releases on state financial assurance funds, impacts on childrens’ health, small business impacts, 
and impacts on low-income and minority populations.  Finally, this analysis considers impacts of 
the rule related to certain executive orders and statutes, including the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act, impacts on Tribal Governments, and Federalism impacts.  
 
1.6  Report Organization 
To support the development of the proposed rule, EPA designed and conducted this 
analysis of the rule’s costs, benefits, and economic impacts consistent with the requirements of 
Executive Order 12866, and OMB Circular A-4.10  Data, methods, and results of this analysis are 
presented in the following chapters:

Chapter 2. Universe of UST Systems Affected by the Proposed Rule 
This regulatory impact analysis addresses the effects of the proposed regulatory changes 
on four types of UST systems: conventional UST systems with prefabricated tanks that store and 
dispense petroleum products; emergency generator tank systems that store fuel for occasional 
use; UST systems with field-constructed tanks that are typically designed to store large volumes 
of fuel; and airport hydrant fuel distribution systems that provide large volumes of fuel to aircraft 
using underground distribution systems. 
This chapter describes the universe of systems, facilities, firms, and sectors that are likely 
to be affected by the proposed regulatory changes, and documents the extent to which state 
regulations already require compliance with the proposed regulations. 
2.1 Types of Entities Affected by the Proposed Rule 
The four types of UST systems that are potentially affected by the proposed regulation 
are characterized as follows: 
• Conventional UST systems (conventional USTs): These systems include the 
universe of facilities and tanks that are currently subject to existing regulations, 
along with ancillary equipment (e.g., piping, dispensers, sumps, spill prevention 
equipment, and release detection equipment).  The majority of these systems store 
and dispense petroleum products and are typically found at gas stations.  A 
limited number store other hazardous substances, but the regulatory impact 
analysis does not consider these UST systems separately.1  These UST systems 
are subject to all requirements under 40 CFR Part 280. 
• Emergency generator tank systems (EGTs):  Emergency generator tank 
systems refer to the tanks and piping for systems that provide longer-term storage 
of fuel for occasional use as a back-up fuel supply.  These tanks are currently 
deferred from 40 CFR Part 280 Subpart D (release detection) but are subject to all 
other requirements under 40 CFR Part 280.  The proposed regulation does not 
address emergency tanks at nuclear power plants, which are regulated by the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission under 10 CFR Part 50, appendix A.2   
                                                          
1 Because tanks storing hazardous substances are also currently subject to the 1988 UST regulations under 
40 CFR Part 280 this analysis assumes that incremental costs and benefits associated with the proposed rule will be 
comparable to the costs and benefits associated with other conventional UST systems. Although hazardous 
substance tanks are not included in the total number of active petroleum UST systems, EPA roughly estimates that 
less than one percent of all active regulated UST systems contain hazardous substances. 
2 See 40 CFR 280.10 Subpart A – Applicability. 
  2-2 
• UST systems with field-constructed tanks (FCTs):  Field-constructed tanks are 
underground bulk storage tanks that are built on-site because they are too large to 
be pre-fabricated.  All identified field-constructed tanks currently in operation are 
owned by Federal facilities and mainly serve operations at military bases.  These 
tanks are currently deferred from all regulation under 40 CFR Part 280, except for 
Subparts A and F, but are typically subject to regulation under the Oil Pollution 
Act of 1990, 40 CFR Part 112 (EPA’s Spill Prevention, Control, and 
Countermeasure regulations). 
• Airport Hydrant Fuel Distribution Systems (AHFDSs):  Airport hydrant fuel 
distribution systems are systems that include one or more tanks (either above-
ground or underground), underground piping, and underground ancillary 
equipment used to fuel aircraft.  These systems do not have a dispenser at the end 
of the piping run, but instead have a pressurized hydrant (fill stand).  Large 
commercial and military airports employ these systems, but most commercial 
systems have only above-ground storage tanks and are thus not affected by the 
proposed regulation.3 These systems are currently deferred from all regulation 
under 40 CFR Part 280, except for Subparts A and F, but are typically subject to 
regulation under 40 CFR Part 112. 
2.2 Configuration of Average Conventional UST System 
Conventional UST systems reflect a relatively consistent configuration of standard 
equipment.  While facility size and complexity vary significantly, this analysis assumes that a 
typical (average) conventional UST system is configured as follows (Exhibit 2-1):4

018, “U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Underground Storage Tanks/Leaking Underground Storage Tanks 
Analytical and Technical Support.” Where gaps existed in the analyses, EPA used the best professional judgment of 
its UST system technical experts.  All supporting materials not included in the appendices can be found in the 
docket for the proposed rule. 
  2-3 
These assumptions best characterize motor fuel retailers, which represent approximately 
80 percent of the 611,449 conventional UST systems in operation in 2009.5 EGT systems and 
other conventional UST systems used to store fuel or hazardous substances are likely to have 
systems with similar components and less complex dispenser systems.  The configurations of 
FCTs and AHFDSs are considered separately, and are described in detail in Appendix A. 
Exhibit 2-2 provides an illustration of an UST system at a retail motor fuel establishment.  Note 
that in this exhibit, the “dispenser sump” is a specific form of under-dispenser containment, and 
the “spill bucket” is an example of spill prevention equipment.

5 The remaining 20 percent of conventional UST systems consist of EGTs and tanks used for storing and 
dispensing fuel in commercial settings, hospitals, manufacturing, transportation, communications and utilities, and 
agriculture.  See Exhibit 2-3 for details. 
  2-4 
2.3 UST Universe Size and Distribution Across Sectors 
The September 30, 2009 Semi-Annual Report of UST Performance Measures reports a 
universe of 611,449 active petroleum tanks (UST systems) in the United States and its 
territories.6,7  This total includes conventional UST systems and emergency generator tank 
systems.  Estimates based on state data suggest that approximately 3.0 percent, or 18,343 of the 
611,449 active UST systems, are emergency generator tanks.8  
In addition to emergency generator and conventional UST systems, the proposed rule 
addresses UST systems with field-constructed tanks and airport hydrant fuel distribution 
systems.  While these two types of systems are deferred under current EPA regulations, a subset 
may be regulated by individual states and included in the total estimate of tanks provided by 
those states.  For the purpose of this analysis, however, these two universes are considered to be 
separate from the 611,449 tanks identified in the 2009 EPA report.  The total universe of UST 
systems with field-constructed tanks and airport hydrant fuel distribution systems is small, 
including approximately 239 UST systems with field-constructed tanks, and 162 airport hydrant 
fuel distribution systems (each hydrant system is supported by an average of roughly eight linked 
tanks).9 
Most UST systems in the United States are located at motor fuel retail establishments 
(i.e., gas stations), and virtually all retail motor fuel establishments use UST systems. 
Approximately 162,000 (161,768) retail fueling sites operated in the United States in 2008.10  Of 
these, approximately 115,000 included convenience stores.11

UST Performance Measures End of Fiscal Year 2009 – As Of September 30, 2009, 
http://www.epa.gov/OUST/cat/ca_09_34.pdf. State and territory underground storage tank programs report to EPA 
periodically throughout the year with data on their UST performance. EPA compiles the data for all states, 
territories, and Indian country and makes the data publicly available at 
http://www.epa.gov/OUST/cat/camarchv.htm.  
7 FY2010 data indicate that the universe of tanks has contracted to 597,333 UST systems.  To consider the 
impacts of declining universe sizes on the results of this analysis, we construct and evaluate an alternative baseline 
for compliance costs and avoided costs in Chapters 3.4.1 and 4.4.1, respectively. 
8 See Industrial Economics, Inc. “Detailed Assessment of UST Universe by Tank Use and Industry Sector,” 
Work Assignment 1-25, Task 6, January 23, 2009. The number of EGTs is assumed to be approximately 3.0 percent 
of all active UST systems based on the weighted average from four state databases. 
9 See Industrial Economics, Inc., “Preliminary Assessment and Scoping of Data Related to Potential 
Revisions to the UST Regulations; Tasks 2-4, Work Assignment 1-25,” November 20, 2008. There are 201 airport 
hydrant fuel distribution systems owned by the Department of Defense and 40 airport hydrant fuel distribution 
systems located at commercial airports. Of these, 162 are not fueled by above-ground storage tanks (two commercial 
airport facilities have UST systems, along with 160 of the 201 Department of Defense systems).

  2-5 
 An analysis of state data by EPA concludes that the average retail motor fuel 
establishment has 2.97 tanks (UST systems).12 Assuming approximately 2.97 UST systems per 
facility and 161,768 facilities, 481,108 UST systems, or 79 percent of all active UST systems, 
are associated with retail motor fuel establishments. 
In addition to traditional motor fuel retailers, big-box retailers, or hypermarkets, represent 
a growing segment of the retail motor fuel seller market. This category (NAICS code 452910) 
includes stores operated by Wal-Mart, Costco, and other large companies.  Collectively, these 
firms operate approximately 4,500 filling stations; each station is likely to have at least three 
UST systems.13  
Other industry sectors that report use of UST systems include agriculture (crop 
production and animal production), commercial (wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation, 
and food services), communications and utilities (wired telecommunications carriers and electric 
power generation, transmission, and distribution), hospitals, manufacturing, transportation, local 
and state government operations, and federal facilities run by the U.S. Departments of Defense 
and Energy. These sectors comprise approximately 130,000 UST systems, including those in the 
government sector (Exhibit 2-3). In many cases, firms in these sectors use UST systems for 
fueling fleets of vehicles such as school buses, delivery trucks, or rental cars.  In other cases, 
UST systems store fuel for operations or emergency use, used oil, or hazardous substances. 
Facilities in sectors other than retail motor fuel have, on average, between 1.5 and 2.3 
UST systems at the facilities that use UST systems.  The actual number of UST systems at a 
specific facility, however, is likely to vary significantly depending on facility size and focus.14  
Results of an analysis of public UST records of 45 states performed for EPA’s Office of 
Underground Storage Tanks suggest that the average number of UST systems per facility (across 
all sectors that use conventional UST systems or EGTs), is approximately 2.74.15  
 
                                                          
12 A 2006 analysis of 13 state UST databases performed for EPA estimated that the average retail motor 
fuel establishment (i.e., facility) has 3.13 tanks. Further adjustments to reconcile various estimates of UST use by 
industry total universe decrease the number of tanks per UST system operating in retail motor fuel settings to 2.97 
tanks. See Industrial Economics, Inc., “Small Entities Screening Analysis of UST Universe by Industry Sector,” WA

2.4 Universe of Facilities and Systems Potentially Affected by Proposed Rule 
EPA expects that all facilities or UST systems in the universe of conventional UST 
systems will be required to comply with one or more regulatory changes in the proposed rule, but 
the number of facilities and systems affected by each specific regulatory change will vary 
depending on the extent of current (baseline) state regulations and the type of equipment 
currently in use.   
To estimate the number of systems that will be required to comply with each regulatory 
change, EPA reviewed publicly available data about state regulations, combined with data from a 
limited sample of states and equipment providers about the use of different technologies for 
release prevention and detection.16 
Exhibit 2-4 identifies the total number of UST systems that could potentially be affected 
by each regulatory change in the proposed regulations, based on the baseline technology 
currently in place in the universe of systems. Exhibit 2-4 identifies the number of UST systems 
or facilities with relevant technologies, the type of system (i.e., conventional UST and EGT 
systems, facilities with conventional UST systems or EGTs, AHFDSs, or FCTs), the proportion 
of the relevant universe of UST systems with the technology, and a summary of the assumptions 
that define the number of affected units.  Note that proposed changes for AHFDSs, EGTs, and 
FCTs affect only those universes of facilities, and Energy Policy Act-related provisions affect 
only facilities and UST systems in Indian country.17  See Appendix B for detailed descriptions of 
the values and sources used in each calculation. These estimates do not reflect baseline state 
regulations (e.g., whether a state already requires interstitial integrity testing). As discussed later 
in this chapter, some baseline state requirements satisfy requirements of the proposed rule.

Protection Agency. Underground Storage Tanks/Leaking Underground Storage Tanks Analytical and Technical 
Support.” Where gaps existed in the analyses, EPA used the best professional judgment of its UST system technical 
experts. All supporting materials not included in the appendices can be found in the docket for the proposed rule. 
17 EPA assumes that all states have adopted Energy Policy Act-related provisions in the baseline, consistent 
with existing guidance.

b  The affected universes presented for these items reflect 50 percent of ultimately affected systems or facilities. Because these 
requirements take effect over time and future costs are discounted, we present the universe affected at year 10 as a central 
estimate. In addition, we adjust unit costs to reflect the fact that the total cost of these requirements grows as the number of 
affected systems or facilities increases. 
 
2.5 Facilities and Systems Affected by Proposed Rule 
Many states currently have baseline regulations consistent with one or more requirements 
in the proposed regulations.  As a result, only a portion of the universe of potentially affected 
facilities will be required to change practices to comply with each regulatory change.  Whereas 
Exhibit 2-4 displays the number of units that may potentially be subject to each requirement, 
Exhibit 2-5 identifies, based on EPA’s review of baseline state regulations, the number of units 
that will be subject to these requirements as a result of the proposed regulations.  For nearly all 
requirements, some portion of the potentially affected universe is already in compliance with the 
proposed regulatory changes. 
Alternative Option 2 will affect the smallest number of systems.  Among the specific 
changes proposed, walkthrough inspections and spill prevention equipment tightness testing 
affect the largest number of UST systems in all scenarios.18  In contrast, several regulatory 
changes (e.g., closure of irreparable lined tanks and pipe replacement requirements) are likely to 
affect only a small number of systems.   
The distribution of incremental impacts of the rule also depends on the distribution of 
baseline technologies across states with different baseline regulations.  Facilities and systems in 
states with fewer current regulations may bear a greater proportion of costs and benefits than 
facilities and systems in states with extensive baseline regulations.  A key limitation of available 
baseline data is that baseline technology data is not available at the state level.  For example, it is 
possible that facilities and systems with specific release detection technologies (e.g., automatic 
tank gauges, (ATGs)) may not be distributed evenly across all states.  However, estimates of the 
                                                          
18 Walkthrough inspections are estimated at a facility level; the number of UST systems estimated as 
affected by these regulations is 440,817. 
  2-11 
percentage of systems using ATGs are available only at the national level.  As a result, the 
regulatory scenarios in Chapters 3 (Compliance Costs) and Chapter 4 (Benefits and Cost 
Savings) reflect regulatory changes required by an “average” facility in a state under the 
proposed rule, assuming that all systems reflect the national profile of existing technologies.  
Analyses of economic impacts and small businesses in Chapter 5 (Distributional Analyses) 
assess the possible distribution of compliance impacts related to this uncertainty.

Chapter 3.  Assessment of Compliance Costs 
 
3.1 Introduction 
This chapter describes EPA’s analysis of the social costs associated with the proposed 
rule. OMB guidance suggests that an analysis that relies on measures of opportunity cost and 
willingness to pay provides a holistic basis for assessing the total cost of any proposed rule. 
Specifically, a social cost analysis should focus on measuring changes in consumer and producer 
surplus by considering the market responses to compliance costs (e.g., changes in demand and 
supply).  Along with the administrative costs incurred by the government, changes in producer 
and consumer surplus reflect the true cost to society of adopting a set of proposed measures.  
For this regulatory impact analysis, EPA uses a combination of direct compliance costs 
and state oversight costs to approximate social costs.  In this context, compliance costs represent 
a reliable indicator of social costs for the following reasons: 
• The regulatory requirements generally focus on additional testing and inspection 
of existing equipment, and do not reflect large-scale investments in equipment or 
significant changes to operations at the facility level.  In addition, the facilities 
affected by the rule are distributed with relative geographic uniformity for 
consumers and producers. 
• Given the small per-facility costs of the rule (less than $900 for the average 
facility, as documented in this chapter), closures or changes in market structure 
represent an unlikely response to the rule.  Therefore, it is unlikely that significant 
changes to production or consumer behavior will affect social costs. 
• The short- and long-run impacts of the rule are not likely to differ significantly.  
Testing and inspection requirements under the rule may offer some opportunities 
for owners and operators to reduce costs by learning over time, but they are not 
likely to reduce costs enough to facilitate large-scale equipment upgrades. 
 For these reasons, compliance costs are likely to be a reasonable approximation for social 
costs over both the short- and long-run.  This chapter presents EPA’s compliance cost 
methodology and results, and summarizes the calculation of government oversight costs.  The 
chapter also provides a discussion of key uncertainties and several brief sensitivity analyses.   An 
analysis of the potential economic impacts of the proposed rule is presented in Chapter 5, and a 
sensitivity analysis that evaluates the effects of alternative interest rates is presented in Chapter 
7. 
 
3.2 Compliance Cost Methodology 
In this chapter, EPA presents its methodology for estimating incremental compliance 
costs of the proposed rule beyond the current baseline costs of existing federal and state 
  3-2 
regulation of underground storage tanks. EPA’s analysis focuses on the specific incremental 
costs that occur as a consequence of the proposed rule.1 Throughout this chapter, the analysis 
distinguishes between three types of costs: 
• System-level: Costs that occur at the individual UST tank level, including 
ancillary equipment. 
• Facility-level: Costs that occur at the level of a facility that owns several USTs; 
typically 2.74 times the system-level cost to reflect UST ownership by the 
average facility.  
• Unit costs: System-level costs related to a particular proposed requirement. For 
example, the requirement to test spill prevention equipment after repairs has a unit 
cost of approximately $130. 
Calculation of total incremental compliance costs for UST facilities reflects two key 
components: identification of specific measures necessary for compliance at individual facilities, 
and calculation of the costs associated with each of these measures. To estimate these costs, EPA 
developed a compliance cost model that identifies incremental equipment and labor requirements 
for an individual system. Based on the baseline equipment, existing state regulations, and 
anticipated responses to the proposed regulation, the model then generates system-specific 
estimates of compliance costs.  Compliance costs include the labor and capital costs associated 
with new equipment and installation, inspection, testing, and recordkeeping.  The model also 
includes other compliance costs, such as those associated with more frequent detection of 
equipment failure and repair of equipment. Some component costs are specific to individual UST 
system configurations – for example, airport hydrant fuel distribution systems or UST systems 
with field-constructed tanks – while others are consistent across all system types.  
We calculate the compliance costs of the proposed rule by measuring three factors: the 
regulations already in place in each state (i.e., baseline regulations); the proportion of facilities or 
UST systems with specific technologies (i.e., the portion of systems that require specific types of 
upgrades or tests); and the unit cost to comply with each proposed element of the proposed 
regulation.  Chapter 2 of this regulatory impact analysis discusses the baseline state regulations 
and the proportion of facilities affected by this rule (see Exhibit 2-5).   
 
An important limitation of our analysis is that we do not have data on the distribution of 
UST technologies. Consider the following from Exhibit 2-5: we estimate that overfill prevention 
tests will be a new requirement for 378,672 systems, and spill prevention equipment tests will be 
a new requirement for 460,696 systems. These requirements could together affect as few as 
460,696 systems if all systems that are affected by overfill prevention testing are a subset of the 
systems that are affected by spill prevention testing. In the absence of additional information, it 
                                                          
1 For this proposed rule, EPA does not specifically attempt to measure baseline regulatory costs.  However, 
costs identified in the 1988 EPA regulation that set original technical standards under 40 CFR Part 280 provide an 
indication of baseline costs.  The 1988 RIA calculated per-tank costs of $28,770, equivalent to $44,450 in 2009 
dollars. See August 24, 1988 RIA entitled Regulatory Impact Analysis of Technical Standards for Underground 
Storage Tanks, Volume 1, page ES-7, Exhibit ES-1). 
  3-3 
is equally plausible that these two requirements affect the entire universe of USTs if they overlap 
as little as possible.  
EPA has not identified any information that could allow us to reliably narrow the 
universe of affected USTs to a number smaller than the entire universe. Further, EPA’s review of 
state data suggests that facilities in all states will be subject to some cost under the proposed 
rule.2 Consequently, when considering the total cost of the proposed rule on a facility or UST 
system basis, we divide the total cost by the number of facilities or systems in the entire 
universe.3 
3.2.1 Categories of  Compliance Costs Analyzed 
This analysis includes the following categories of compliance costs: operations and 
maintenance costs; capital costs; and implicit capital costs, or “time value of money costs” 
associated with earlier detection of equipment failure.  Because the proposed rule focuses on 
operational improvements, operations and maintenance costs constitute the majority of the 
compliance costs identified in this analysis.  These costs are relatively frequent, recurring costs 
that mainly involve a service activity. Operations and maintenance activities include the labor 
and materials costs associated with maintenance of equipment, routine testing, and inspection 
(whether performed by the owner, operator, or a contractor). This analysis assumes that UST 
facility owners and operators pay in full for these costs when they occur (that is, they do not 
obtain financing and pay over time).4 
Because the proposed rule does not focus on broad equipment requirements, capital costs 
represent a small portion of the total compliance costs for this proposed rule.  Capital costs 
address the purchase and installation of new equipment, such as installing a new double-walled 
UST or under-dispenser containment. Total capital costs typically include installation labor and 
initial service required to ensure the new equipment is fully functioning. EPA assumes that UST 
owners and operators finance these compliance costs over the life of the equipment; all capital 
costs are calculated over a regulatory time horizon of 20 years.5  The following examples 
characterize the three types of capital cost calculations that are relevant to this regulatory 
analysis: 
                                                          
2 The discounted cost per UST system ranges from less than $100 in one state to over $700, with costs in 
54 states and territories falling between $200 and $450. 
3 We address uncertainty in the distribution of technology and costs with a set of sensitivity analyses in 
section 3.5 of this chapter, and we consider the economic impacts of different distributions of costs in Chapter 5. 
4 Certain one-time costs that occur only once over the regulatory time horizon (e.g., one-time spending on 
initial operator training for personnel at existing facilities) are also annualized over 20 years. 
5 EPA assumes that owners and operators amortize all capital costs over a 20-year expected regulatory 
horizon to be consistent with the 20-year expected lifetime of an UST system. For equipment with a lifetime shorter 
than 20 years, EPA assumes that a proportion of the universe is affected per year; for example, EPA assumes that 
piping is replaced every five years, such that one-fifth of the universe must replace it every year. The central 
analysis uses a seven percent discount rate, consistent with Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-94, 
Revised, October 29, 1992.  Other discount rates are considered in Chapter 7. 
  3-4 
Existing equipment replacements: An UST system owner or operator must upgrade an 
existing system with new equipment to comply with a requirement under the proposed rule (e.g., 
facilities with EGTs may be required to install release detection equipment if the deferral is 
removed).  The incremental compliance cost is the total cost of the new equipment and 
installation (including removal of existing equipment).6 Any additional (incremental) operation 
and maintenance costs are also included. 
New equipment requirements: An operator is installing new or replacement equipment 
as an ordinary business expense.  Under baseline regulations, Equipment A is compliant. 
However, new regulations require a higher level of compliance for new tank systems that can be 
satisfied at lowest cost by Equipment B. The incremental compliance cost to the owner of the 
equipment is the additional cost (if any) of purchasing and installing and operating Equipment B 
instead of Equipment A.  The costs of this requirement reflect the timing of the normal 
replacement cycle for all equipment in the universe.  For example, owners and operators 
installing new UST systems will be required to use technologies other than flow restrictors to 
ensure release prevention. 
Time value of money (TVM) costs:  Under baseline regulations, the average UST 
system requires inspection every three years.  EPA estimates that the baseline three-year 
inspection, on average, identifies a hypothetical repair or replacement cost of $100 associated 
with certain equipment.  Under the proposed rule, a new annual test would discover the repair 
sooner and require repair or replacement one-to-two years earlier.  While the repair expense is 
the same, the proposed rule generates a time value of money cost by requiring an expenditure 
sooner.7  
EPA estimates that the proposed regulations will impose capital costs on the following 
components due to earlier detection of problems as a result of the new testing requirements: 
• Overfill prevention equipment; 
• Spill prevention equipment; 
• Interstitial areas; and 
                                                          
6 This approach may overstate costs, as it does not account for the age of existing equipment. Owners and 
operators typically plan for new capital expenditures over the lifetime of existing equipment, recording depreciation 
as operations consume its usefulness over time. If an owner or operator is close to replacing certain equipment and is 
required to replace that equipment when the proposed rule becomes effective, he or she incurs a lower incremental 
cost than an owner or operator who only recently installed that equipment.  By not attempting to adjust for this 
factor, EPA assumes that owners and operators replace brand new equipment, a conservatism that results in a higher 
cost. Using this approach, these annualized one-time costs comprise approximately one percent of annual costs 
under Preferred Option and Alternative 2. Under Alternative 1, the requirement of three-year spill prevention 
equipment replacement increases these costs to 38 percent of total costs. 
7 There is significant uncertainty regarding whether total expenditures would increase or decrease over 
time. More frequent inspections may lead to more frequent repairs and replacements but may also reduce the 
severity and cost of issues. 
  3-5 
• ATGs, interstitial monitors, vapor monitors, groundwater monitors, and line leak 
detectors. 
The proposed rule requires testing, in addition to inspections, for several UST system 
components. EPA assumes that testing adds value to baseline release prevention strategies in two 
ways: first, testing detects issues with an UST system that may not be detectable in inspections.  
In addition, in some cases, testing will occur more frequently than baseline inspections and 
therefore may identify issues that occur between inspections. This analysis therefore considers 
two types of increased capital costs. First, EPA assumes that additional testing required under the 
proposed rule will identify malfunctions that prior inspections would have overlooked, and will 
therefore mandate additional compliance costs related to repair and replacement of equipment. 
Second, some baseline compliance costs will occur earlier than they would in the baseline, 
creating time value of money costs as owners and operators forgo the use of funds for other 
investments.  The time value of money cost of incurring a repair sooner is estimated at seven 
percent, consistent with OMB’s discount rate.  See Appendix D for the detailed cost 
methodology. 
 
3.2.2 Estimation of System-Level Compliance Costs for UST Systems 
Estimates of system-level compliance costs for each part of the proposed rule are based 
on publicly available data on equipment, installation, and testing costs, information collected 
from professionals in industries that provide relevant equipment and services, and EPA’s 
professional judgment.8  Costs are estimated to occur according to the rule implementation 
schedule identified in Exhibit 1-2; we use an annual discount rate of seven percent to adjust 
costs with compliance windows of more than one year. 
Labor costs used in this analysis reflect labor-hour estimates from EPA Information 
Collection Request 1360.08 for specific inspection and recordkeeping tasks.  The cost of labor is 
based on Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) labor rates for skill categories appropriate to the retail 
sector and technical requirements of the proposed rule.9 In particular, EPA selected labor rates 
that correspond to categories of labor employed in the retail motor fuels sector (NAICS 447).  
The analysis adjusts these rates using a 12 percent overhead factor and a fringe benefits factor of 
28.3 percent, which is specific to service-providing industries.10 For requirements that are likely 
                                                          
8 E2, Incorporated, memoranda and analyses submitted under Contract EP-W-05-018, “U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. Underground Storage Tanks/Leaking Underground Storage Tanks Analytical and Technical 
Support.” Where gaps existed in the analyses, EPA used the best professional judgment of its UST system technical 
experts. All supporting materials not included in the appendices can be found in the docket for the proposed rule.  
9 Labor rates reflect the May 2008 Occupational Employment and Wage publication by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. See Appendix D for the particular Standard Occupational Classification codes used. EPA does not 
use the costs in its Information Collection Request 1360.08 because those labor rates reflect all industries and do not 
represent typical costs to the majority of UST owners and operators.  
10 The overhead factor of 12 percent comes from Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, p. 
D-7. Although this rate reflects government overhead rates, we believe it is also representative of the low-overhead 
structure of the retail motor fuels sector.  The fringe benefits factor is from Bureau of Labor Services, Employer 
Costs for Employee Compensation, September 2009. See Table 10: All workers, service-providing industries. 
  3-6 
to be satisfied by third-parties, such as testing, labor costs are included in the costs of those 
services.   
In addition, specific requirements under the proposed regulation are addressed as follows: 
• For proposed regulatory changes that take effect over time as equipment ages, the 
analysis assumes a constant rate of equipment replacement, and calculates a 
constant annual payment for the net present value of 20 years of replacements. 
Appendix D discusses the specific assumptions made in the analysis. 
• To identify the total system-level compliance cost of removing deferrals from 
airport hydrant fuel distribution systems (AHFDSs) and field-constructed tanks 
(FCTs), the analysis calculates both the direct costs of removing the deferral of 
these systems from the regulations under 40 CFR Part 280, and the additional 
costs of complying with other new regulatory options that apply to all systems 
(and become relevant when deferrals are removed).  Under the proposed 
regulations, owners and operators of these systems must perform annual bulk line 
testing at prescribed rates or use an automatic tank gauge at prescribed leak rates.  
Appendix A discusses specific assumptions related to these tank populations.  
• To estimate the total system-level compliance cost of removing the deferral from 
emergency generator tanks, the analysis calculates the cost of complying with 
specific proposed changes that apply to the broader universe of conventional UST 
systems and become relevant when the deferral is removed. Removal of the 
deferral under the proposed rule means that EGTs must comply with release 
detection requirements at 40 CFR Part 280, Subpart D.  
Exhibit 3-1 presents the unit-level costs for the individual requirements in the proposed rule.11

i  Cost estimates were derived using a seven percent discount rate. 
 
3.3 Calculation of Incremental Compliance Costs 
This analysis estimates the compliance cost of the proposed rule by calculating the 
incremental cost of each regulatory change on the population of tank systems in every U.S. state 
and territory. This procedure relies on national estimates of the universe of systems employing 
specific baseline technologies, as well as EPA’s assessment of the baseline regulatory 
requirements in each state and territory.12 The analysis categorizes compliance costs into one-
time or operations and maintenance costs and amortizes one-time compliance costs over the 20-
year regulatory time horizon.13 As a final step, it discounts annual compliance costs associated 
with several of the proposed changes to delayed compliance horizons specified in the proposed 
rule (e.g., overfill operability testing must be performed within three years of the date the 
proposed rule becomes effective).  
To calculate compliance costs, EPA employs a number of assumptions, some of which 
likely overstate compliance costs: 
• Time value of money costs. This analysis does not assume that the rate at which 
problems occur in UST systems will decline as a result of the proposed rule. The 
number and severity of problems will likely fall due to more frequent testing and 
inspections, but the rate of decline is uncertain and the analysis does not attempt 
to adjust for these changes. This likely causes the analysis to overestimate the 
costs of the proposed rule.  
                                                          
12 For details regarding these assumptions, see Appendix B. 
13 See footnote 5 for an explanation of the use of a 20-year time horizon. 
  3-9 
• Size of universe. EPA’s analysis assumes that the number of UST systems in the 
universe remains constant over time, with new systems replacing closures. EPA’s 
end-of-year reporting data reveal that the universe of conventional UST systems 
has declined at a rate over two percent per year since 1999.14 Assuming this 
pattern continues, future annual compliance costs due to the proposed rule are 
likely to be lower than estimated in this analysis. However, in absence of other 
data we assume that new installations and upgrades will offset all closures, and 
that annual compliance costs will remain constant.  Impacts of assuming an 
alternative baseline universe of UST systems that declines over time are discussed 
in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.4.1.   
• Full compliance. EPA assumes that all owners and operators subject to each 
requirement will come into compliance. This ensures a high estimate of costs, as 
each system subject to the rule implements the required measures and 
consequently incurs the related costs.  
• Timeliness of repairs. EPA assumes that all issues identified through testing of 
equipment will be properly addressed through immediate repair or replacement of 
equipment. This may overstate costs if owners or operators fail to address 
identified issues in a timely fashion. 
• Date on which costs are incurred. EPA assumes that all costs are incurred at the 
beginning of the year in which each requirement of the proposed rule becomes 
effective. This may overstate costs that occur at the end of the time frame. 
These combined assumptions help ensure that the total costs estimated in each scenario below 
are not likely to be understated, even in cases where some uncertainty is associated with unit cost 
estimates for equipment or testing.  Two key areas of uncertainty that affect the distribution of 
costs are noted below. 
• Geographic distribution of technologies:  EPA lacks information on how UST 
systems with specific equipment (e.g., ATG) are distributed nationally.  If most 
are located within states with existing applicable requirements, then costs could 
be lower (conversely, if most are located in states with no existing applicable 
requirements, then costs could be higher). In the absence of this data, EPA 
assumes a uniform distribution of technologies across all states. EPA assesses the 
extent to which this assumption creates cost uncertainty at the end of this chapter. 
• Distribution of costs across systems:  EPA does not have information on how 
costs are likely to be distributed among the systems that are subject to new 
requirements. For example, a correlation among systems that require overfill 
operability testing, spill prevention equipment tightness testing, and interstitial 
integrity testing after repair would concentrate costs on these systems in ways that 
                                                          
14 See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Underground Storage Tanks, Semi-Annual Report 
of UST Performance Measures for Fiscal Years 1999 and 2009.  In addition, industry data indicates that in recent 
years, the net decline in the population of facilities with UST systems has been roughly 1.4 percent per year. 
  3-10 
EPA’s primary assessment of costs does not capture. While this does not affect 
total cost estimates, EPA assesses the distributional consequences of an outcome 
where costs are highly-concentrated in Chapter 5.  
3.3.1. Calculation of Incremental Compliance Costs Using an Alternative Baseline 
 EPA’s primary analysis assumes that the universe of UST systems stays constant over 
time. That is, the analysis assumes that when an UST system enters the universe, another exits, 
and vice versa. However, data show that the universe of UST systems has been declining over 
the past two decades (albeit at a slowing rate). Therefore, EPA also assesses compliance costs 
associated with the proposed rule based on an alternative baseline that projects a declining 
universe. 
 To calculate the rate of universe decline, EPA mapped historical data on the universe of 
UST systems from 1991 through 2010 to an exponential one-phase decay function, which 
appears to most accurately represent the observed behavior of the UST system universe over 
time.15 Steep declines in the universe of UST systems in past years reflect increases in tank size 
as well as industry consolidation. However, these declines may be reaching functional limits, 
both because the number of fuel outlets needed to serve the population is considerable, and 
because tank sizes may be reaching a practical limit in their ability to be transported and 
installed.16,17 
 The function used to project future UST universe sizes indicates that over a 20-year time 
period, the annual number of affected UST systems gradually declines to 586,021 UST systems 
by year 20 under this alternative baseline.18  The number of UST systems affected under this 
alternative baseline is approximately 97 percent of the size of the original baseline, which 
assumes a constant universe size of 611,449 UST systems over this period. As a result, 
compliance costs associated with the proposed rule are only marginally smaller under this 
alternative baseline.  See Appendix J for additional details. 
                                                          
15 To estimate future UST universe sizes, we used a single exponential decay function, which assumes that 
a quantity declines at a rate proportional to its value. This is an appropriate function given the singular and slowing 
rate of decline observed in the universe of UST systems over time. The equation for such an exponential singular 
decay function is Y = (Yo – P) * e(-k*X) + P, where P represents the “plateau,” or limit of the function and k 
represents the function’s half-life. (See Appendix J for additional details.) 
16 See Wayne Geyer, “Where Has Our Petroleum Storage Capacity Gone?” Steel Tank Institute, 
https://www.steeltank.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=h8g9YO5y%2BfI%3D&tabid=108&mid=502. This source 
indicates simultaneous trends in increasing average tank sizes as well as decreasing UST system totals.      
17 While this alternative baseline assumes a steady decline in the number of UST systems, it is possible that 
the number of UST systems may actually increase in the future to trend with population growth and economic 
expansion as more people living in more areas may necessitate more retail motor fuel outlets. 
18 EPA assumes that owners and operators amortize all capital costs over a 20-year expected regulatory 
horizon to be consistent with the 20-year expected lifetime of an UST system.

3.4 Results of Assessment of Compliance Costs 
Exhibit 3-2 presents a summary of the estimated incremental compliance costs 
associated with the proposed rule by type of UST system affected. In all options, it is clear that 
the category of conventional UST systems will bear the largest proportion of compliance costs 
under the proposed rule. While compliance costs associated with removal of deferrals from 
EGTs are constant across regulatory scenarios, other costs vary substantially among the 
regulatory options.  The model parameters used to produce the results discussed in this chapter 
are presented in Appendix E and were selected to reflect the preferred and alternative options 
described in Chapter 1.

a Conventional UST systems include all systems that are not AHFDSs, FCTs, or EGTs. 
b Costs for EGTs are lower in Alternative 2 because operability testing is performed every 3 years versus every year under other 
options. 
c  Cost estimates were derived using a seven percent discount rate. 
 
Exhibit 3-3 presents a disaggregation of compliance costs under each regulatory option. 
The following areas contribute significantly to the differences in compliance costs among the 
alternatives. 
• Release prevention: The greatest difference in compliance costs between 
Alternative 1 and the Preferred Option is related to release prevention; 
specifically, due to the combination of walkthrough inspections, overfill 
prevention equipment tests, spill prevention equipment tests, and interstitial 
integrity tests, and testing after repairs.  These requirements account for 55 
percent and 73 percent of total compliance costs, respectively. This variation is 
largely dependent on the testing or inspection frequency required under each 
alternative.  
• Removal of deferrals for AHFDSs and UST systems with FCTs: Removal of 
deferrals for AHFDSs and FCTs is accompanied by tightness testing of equipment 
that varies in frequency depending on the alternative. This tightness test drives 
most of the variation in compliance costs. Under the Preferred Option, total costs 
for these systems are $23 million, or approximately 11 percent of total 
compliance costs; under Alternative 1, total costs are $153 million or 
  3-12 
approximately 29 percent of total compliance costs.19 Alternative 2 maintains the 
deferrals and therefore has no incremental compliance cost. 
• Operability tests for release detection methods: The Preferred Option and 
Alternative 1 each require annual testing of the operability of release detection 
systems, while Alternative 2 requires these tests every three years. Operability 
testing costs approximately $21 million under both the Preferred Option and 
Alternative 1, though they constitute 11 percent of total compliance costs for the 
Preferred Option and only four percent of total compliance costs for Alternative 1. 
Three-year testing under Alternative 2 (which includes operability tests for 
groundwater and vapor monitoring since they would remain as release detection 
methods) costs approximately $8 million, or about seven percent of total 
compliance costs for that option. 
In total, these categories represent approximately 90 percent of the total compliance costs for 
each option. In addition, the adjustment of release detection leak rate probabilities under 
Alternative 1 constitutes most of the remaining 10 percent of costs for that option. 
EPA determines average compliance costs per system by dividing the total cost of the 
proposed rule by the total 611,449 systems in the regulated universe of conventional UST 
systems and EGTs.  EPA’s analysis shows that the compliance cost for this proposed rule is $300 
per system, or approximately $890 per typical facility among motor fuel retailers, the sector with 
the highest average number of UST systems per facility.20 
Exhibit 3-4 presents the same total costs as Exhibit 3-3 but shows the number of systems 
affected and the cost of the requirement per affected system. The costs in this exhibit reflect 
annualized one-time costs, discounting, and adjustments for the adoption of certain requirements 
over time (e.g., elimination of flow restrictors for new and replaced tanks), and therefore differ 
from the unit costs presented in Exhibit 3-1. It is important to note that the unit costs in Exhibit 
3-4 cannot be summed to obtain a cost per system, as nearly all systems are already in 
compliance with some requirements of the proposed rule.  
                                                          
19 In addition, Alternative 1 calls for tightness testing at a lower leak rate. See Appendix A for details.  
20 The $300 estimate excludes costs associated with removal of deferrals for AHFDSs and UST systems 
with FCTs, assumes 2.97 systems per retail motor fuel facility, and includes the cost of $23 per facility for them to 
review the regulation.  This approach does not address variability of baseline compliance across systems; to assess 
uncertainty associated with this approach, EPA presents a sensitivity analysis in Chapter 5.

a Alternative 1 calls for spill prevention equipment replacement every three years. For analytical convenience, we annualize the cost of replacement over three years and incorporate it as an O&M 
cost.   
b Costs fall under Alternative 1 compared with the Preferred Option because replacement of spill prevention equipment every 36 months will eliminate the need for repairs to such equipment. 
c Costs related to removal of deferrals for the regulation of emergency generator tanks include the cost of removal of deferrals, installation and maintenance of ATG on approximately seven percent 
of systems, installation and maintenance of SIR on 60 percent of systems, and performing operability testing on all EGT systems. See Appendix D for details.  O&M costs for emergency generator 
tanks are lower in Alternative 2 because operability testing is performed every 3 years versus every year under other options. 
d Operations and maintenance costs associated with the adjustment of release detection leak rate probabilities is negative because operators avoid costly testing related to false alarms. These avoided 
costs are the only items included in the O&M for this requirement. 
e Airport hydrant fuel distribution systems include a capital cost because tanks associated with airport hydrant fuel distribution systems without existing ATGs are assumed to install ATGs to comply 
with the requirement.  UST systems with field-constructed tanks without existing ATGs are assumed to conduct annual precision tightness tests to comply with the requirement.  See Appendix A for 
details. 
f Although the closure of lined tanks represents a capital cost, we consider it an operations and maintenance cost as a modeling convenience. See Appendix D for details. 
g Total may not add correctly due to rounding. 
h As a simplifying assumption, EPA assumes that UST systems enter and exit the universe at a constant annual rate, such that the total number of UST systems in the universe does not change. We 
assume that operations and maintenance costs associated with these systems offset each other, as the number of entries equals the number of exits; however, new systems entering the universe will 
still incur incremental capital costs associated with certain requirements (e.g., a new emergency generator tank would need to install a release detection method).  For modeling purposes, we account 
for these new units in the “Additions for new units.”  The costs shown reflect the capital costs associated with new units for all but the following requirements: elimination of flow restrictors for new 
tanks, requirement of secondary containment for new tanks, and requirement of under-dispenser containment for new dispenser systems.

a Requirements that apply at the facility level are converted to a system basis using a conversion factor of 2.74 systems per facility. 
b Because the number of systems affected varies depending on the individual testing requirements, we estimate the number of systems affected by all three requirements by dividing their 
total cost by the sum of their unit costs. For example, if the three requirements had total unit costs of $100 and created new costs of $100,000, we would estimate that they affect 1,000 
systems. 
c Alternative 1 calls for spill prevention equipment replacement every three years. For analytical convenience, we annualize the cost of replacement over three years and incorporate it as

3.4.1 Assessment of Compliance Costs under the Alternative Baseline Scenario 
Exhibit 3-5 presents total annual compliance costs of the proposed rule under the 
alternative baseline discussed in Section 3.3.1. Annual compliance costs are slightly less than 
those presented in Exhibit 3-2, reflecting the fact that the cumulative universe of affected 
systems in the alternative baseline is only marginally smaller than the universe in the original 
baseline.

3.5 Sensitivity Analyses 
Certain aspects of EPA’s compliance cost estimates are characterized by significant 
uncertainty and are sufficiently large that deviations from chosen assumptions may have a 
measurable impact on cost estimates. In this section, the analysis evaluates the sensitivity of 
certain results to variation in key parameters. These sensitivity analyses include evaluations of: 
• Total compliance costs to the proposed rule under an alternative estimate of labor 
costs. Specifically, the analysis evaluates the effect of using higher labor rates, 
overhead costs, and fringe benefits factors, and lower average labor costs. 
• Highest and lowest compliance cost scenarios for the distribution of technologies 
tested for overfill prevention equipment operability, tightness of spill prevention 
equipment, and interstitial integrity. If facilities using these technologies are 
disproportionately located in states that do not already have similar regulations in 
place, costs could be higher than estimates presented in the earlier parts of this 
chapter. Similarly, if affected facilities are located in states that already have 
similar regulations in place, costs could be substantially lower than estimated. 
• High-end and low-end estimates of possible compliance costs for interstitial 
integrity testing. EPA’s estimate of costs associated with interstitial integrity 
testing assumes a certain distribution of technologies, each of which carries a 
different testing cost. Variation in this distribution of technologies among 
  3-18 
facilities can significantly affect the estimates of compliance costs associated with 
interstitial integrity testing. 
3.5.1. Compliance Costs of the Proposed Rule Using Alternative Estimates of Labor Rates, 
Overhead Costs, and Fringe Benefits 
For conventional UST facilities, EPA has selected labor, overhead, and fringe benefits 
rates that best reflect a “typical” UST facility.  These labor rates are representative of skilled 
labor costs at motor fuel retailers, which own and operate roughly 80 percent of the universe of 
UST systems.  The use of these rates has a material impact on the estimated compliance cost of 
the proposed rule because they drive the operations and maintenance costs associated with 
requirements for walkthrough inspections and operability tests. 
To evaluate the impact of alternative labor rates on total compliance cost estimates, EPA 
considered two alternative scenarios.  The first is consistent with the OUST Information 
Collection Request 1360.08 and reflects labor rates reflective of economy-wide average wages, 
benefits, and overhead.  This represents a high-end estimate because it reflects industries with 
highly skilled labor requirements and benefits (e.g., law firms).1  The second uses specific labor 
categories and costs representative of retail motor fuel establishments, but assumes that lower-
level staff may complete walkthrough inspections.2 
Exhibit 3-6 presents the results for the three labor category scenarios.  While one-time 
costs are not affected by the change in labor rates, operations and maintenance costs in the high-
cost scenario are roughly $100 million higher than EPA’s primary estimate, totaling $300 million 
rather than $200 million (an increase of 50 percent). The majority of this increase is due to 
higher operations and maintenance costs related to walkthrough inspections and operability tests. 
In contrast, the low-end labor-rate cost estimate totals approximately $180 million, roughly $20 
million (or 10 percent) lower than EPA’s central estimate. In addition to lower benefits and labor 
rates, this estimate assumes that clerical-level personnel will perform walkthrough inspections. 
This is consistent with remarks by UST experts, who indicated these tasks were most likely to be 
completed by non-technical workers.  For AHFDSs and systems with FCTs, EPA uses constant 
industry average labor rates across all scenarios. 
                                                          
1 These labor categories were reported in OUST Information Collection Request 1360.08, dated October 
24, 2007. We used revised labor rates from those categories to reflect 2009 conditions.  However, documentation in 
this analysis did not provide a reason for the use of economy-wide average labor rates, and our assessment of the 
universe suggests that retail-based rates are more appropriate. 
2 Engineering experts consulted for this analysis suggest that walkthrough inspections are most likely to be 
performed by gas station clerks or service attendants, not technical personnel.

wages, as reported in BLS Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, September 2008. Table 10: Trade, transportation, and 
utilities - retail trade. Overhead rate is 12 percent from OMB Circular A-76, p. D-7.  Assumes that service station attendants 
perform walkthrough inspections, consistent with information from experts consulted for this analysis.

BLS National Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2008 for Technical for operability testing (49-2094 Electrical and 
Electronics Repairers, Commercial and Industrial Equipment) and Legal (23-1011 Lawyers). Benefits rate is 28.3 percent (BLS 
Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, September 2009. Table 10: All workers, service-providing industries). Overhead 
rate is 12 percent from OMB Circular A-76, p. D-7. 
c Upper Estimate relies BLS Employer Costs For Employee Compensation, September 2008 for Managerial (Table 9, 
Management, Professional, and Related); Technical and Technical for operability testing (Table 10, Professional and Technical 
Services (Service Industries)); and Clerical (Table 11, Office and Administrative Support); and BLS National Occupational 
Employment and Wages, May 2008 for Legal (23-1011 Lawyers). Overhead rate used is 67 percent from OUST Information 
Collection Request 1360.08 from October 24, 2007. 
d Walkthrough inspections under the Lower Estimate rely on clerical labor rates estimated using BLS Standard Occupational 
Code 53-6031, Service Station Attendants; under other scenarios, we use technical labor rates estimated using BLS Standard 
Occupational Code 53-1021, First-Line Supervisors/Managers of Helpers, Laborers, and Material Movers, Hand. UST experts 
consulted for this analysis suggest that walkthrough inspections are most likely to be performed by gas station clerks or service 
attendants, not technical personnel (e.g. 3rd-party contractors). 
e Baseline activities for operators of tanks that use groundwater or vapor monitoring include activities such as recording of 
monthly measurements, which rely on technical labor.  By eliminating groundwater and vapor monitoring as release detection 
methods under the proposed rule, these activities will no longer be required.  As a result, increasing labor rates reduces the 
incremental costs of the proposed rule. 
f  The labor rate used for these types of system is the latest ICR labor rate, except for a component of the Operator Training 
requirement, which uses the United States Air Force labor rate for pay grade E-6 over 3. 
g Totals may not add exactly due to rounding. 
h As a simplifying assumption, EPA assumes that UST systems enter and exit the universe at a constant annual rate, such that 
the total number of UST systems in the universe does not change. We assume that operations and maintenance costs associated 
with these systems offset each other, as the number of entries equals the number of exits; however, new systems entering the 
universe will still incur incremental capital costs associated with certain requirements (e.g., a new emergency generator tank 
would need to install a release detection method).  For modeling purposes, we account for these new units in the “Additions for 
new units.”  The costs shown reflect the capital costs associated with new units for all but the following requirements: 
elimination of flow restrictors for new tanks, requirement of secondary containment for new tanks, and requirement of under-
dispenser containment for new dispenser systems.

3.5.2 Sensitivity Analysis of Distribution of Technologies Tested for Overfill Operability, 
Spill Prevention Equipment Tightness, and Interstitial Integrity 
Because data on the distribution of UST technologies (including release detection and 
prevention technologies) is available only at a national level, EPA is not able to identify how 
facilities and systems with certain technologies are distributed across different states.  As a 
result, the cost analysis assumes that technologies are distributed uniformly across all states and 
territories.  For systems that require testing for overfill operability, spill prevention equipment 
tightness, and interstitial integrity, actual compliance costs may differ substantially from EPA’s 
estimates if this assumption does not hold.   For example, if facilities using these technologies 
are disproportionately located in states that do not already have similar testing requirements in 
place in the baseline, compliance costs could be higher than the estimates based on a uniform 
distribution presented in Exhibit 3-2 and Exhibit 3-3. Similarly, if affected facilities are 
concentrated in states that already have similar regulations in place in the baseline, then actual 
compliance costs could be substantially lower than estimates based on a uniform distribution.  
To investigate the impact of the assumption of uniform distribution of technologies, EPA 
performed a bounding analysis of the two extreme cases of distribution.  Exhibit 3-7 reports the 
possible range of values for scenarios where compliance cost is the lowest (i.e., facilities are 
located in states that already satisfy the proposed rule), the actual model scenario based on 
uniform distribution, and the scenario in which compliance costs are highest. Variation between 
the minimum and maximum cost scenarios totals approximately $21 million, or eleven percent of 
the total compliance costs estimated for the rule. EPA’s primary estimate of these costs is near 
the mid-point of the range of estimates.

3.5.3 Sensitivity Analysis of Compliance Costs for Interstitial Integrity Testing 
EPA’s estimates of compliance costs associated with interstitial integrity tests are 
weighted to exclude tanks and piping that are continuously monitored using vacuum, pressure, or 
liquid-filled methods.3  In addition, tanks using continuous interstitial monitoring sensors are 
excluded.  For the purpose of this analysis, EPA assumes that five percent of tanks and 90 
percent of piping with interstices will require such testing.4 Costs may vary to the extent that the 
actual number of facilities with these types of equipment differs from these estimates. 
To establish a range of possible values, EPA investigated the scenarios outlined in 
Exhibit 3-8. For relatively large changes in EPA’s choices of parameters for universe affected, 
total costs for this proposed change vary between $5 million and $12 million.  This uncertainty 
of $7 million represents four percent of the total estimated compliance costs of the rule.

3.5.4 Summary of Sensitivity Findings 
EPA’s sensitivity findings suggest that possible variation in labor rates is likely to 
produce the most significant impact on the estimated cost of the proposed rule: plausible 
selections for labor rates may reduce preferred option costs by approximately $20 million (10 
percent) or increase them by $100 million (50 percent). Separately, EPA has identified potential 
variation of approximately eleven percent related to the distribution of technologies involved in 
overfill operability testing, integrity testing of interstitial areas, and spill prevention equipment 
tightness testing, and approximately four percent related to assumptions regarding interstitial 
                                                          
3 Secondary containment areas include tank and piping interstitial areas as well as containment sumps used 
as part of the piping secondary containment or interstitial monitoring.  Under the proposed rule, EPA will allow the 
following exceptions to interstitial integrity tests: (1) Tanks: Owners and operators using continuous interstitial 
monitoring on their tanks will not be required to perform periodic interstitial integrity tests; (2) Piping: Owners and 
operators using vacuum monitoring, pressure monitoring, or liquid-filled interstitial space monitoring on their 
underground piping will not be required to perform periodic interstitial integrity tests; and (3) Containment Sumps – 
Owners and operators using containment sumps which have two walls and continuously monitor the interstitial 
space between the walls for releases are not required to perform interstitial integrity tests. 
4 An interstitial integrity test is performed in the space between tank walls, pipe walls, or in a secondary 
containment sump area and ensures the area being tested has integrity and will contain a leak.

integrity testing. We note that each of these sensitivity analyses reflects variation compared with 
the primary estimates of costs presented throughout this chapter.  
These analyses only illustrate the uncertainty surrounding certain elements of the 
proposed rule. The estimates presented in the body of this chapter represent reasonable, 
conservative central tendencies for the costs of the proposed rule.  
 
3.6 Administrative Compliance Costs 
In addition to compliance costs related to the operation of UST systems, the proposed 
rule will also impose certain administrative costs on affected entities. We outline these costs 
below. 
 
3.6.1 State Government Administrative Compliance Costs 
The proposed rule imposes new Underground Storage Tank program administration 
requirements on state government agencies.5  Specifically, state government agencies will incur 
costs associated with new notification requirements, and costs associated with obtaining and 
reading the regulations. This section reviews state government costs associated with these 
activities.  
Costs associated with obtaining and reading the regulations assume that 10 people will 
each take six hours to read the regulation in each state (using the legal labor rate for states of $47 
per hour from OUST’s ICR 1360.08).  In addition, based on the ICR, we assume that the 
reporting and recordkeeping burden for states to apply for State Program Approval (SPA) is 
approximately 28.5 hours (using the clerical labor rate for states of $26 per hour).  The total 
compliance cost in nominal terms is therefore approximately $205,000; the annualized 
compliance cost assuming the 20-year regulatory time horizon is approximately $19,000.6 States 
that already require ownership change notifications will incur compliance costs associated with 
these activities.  
State agencies that do not currently have a requirement for notification of changes in UST 
ownership or for at least an annual UST registration must also process a certain number of 
notices due to annual turnover in facility ownership. State government compliance costs for this 
activity assume a typical nominal recordkeeping cost of $30 per facility, based on OUST’s ICR 
1360.08; compliance costs assume the use of existing recordkeeping systems.   Eight states and 
territories do not currently have recordkeeping requirements consistent with the proposed 
                                                          
5 In some cases, UST systems are directly owned or operated by local, state, and federal government 
entities. These costs are subsumed in the estimates of compliance costs presented earlier in this chapter. 
6 Consistent with other parts of this regulatory impact analysis, we amortize one-time or capital costs over 
the regulatory time horizon of 20 years. If these costs are phased in over a three-year period, annual costs decrease 
to approximately $18,000. 
  3-24 
regulation.7  These eight states and territories will incur approximately $100,000 per year, due to 
an annual turnover rate of approximately 10 percent in UST facility ownership.   
Lastly, each state agency will incur costs to process the one-time notifications of 
existence for EGTs, AHFDSs, and FCTs.  State government compliance costs for this activity 
assume a typical nominal recordkeeping cost of $30 per facility, based on OUST’s ICR 1360.08; 
compliance costs assume the use of existing recordkeeping systems.   Based on the estimated 
universe of EGTs, AHFDSs, and FCTs, the total state processing cost in nominal terms is 
approximately $560,000; the annualized processing cost assuming the 20-year regulatory time 
horizon is approximately $53,000. 
Total state government administrative compliance costs sum to $170,000 per year. Note 
that under alternative baseline assumptions, these costs would decline by a very small percentage 
(roughly 2 percent) as the universe of affected systems declines. These costs are reflected in 
Exhibit 3-10. 
3.6.2 Costs to Regulated Universe to Review Regulations 
This analysis assumes that all facility operators in the universe will be required to read 
the proposed rule in order to comply with it. For conventional USTs and EGTs, we estimate that 
reading and understanding the proposed rule will require 4.75 hours of labor from a manager at 
each facility. This equates to a one-time cost of approximately $244 for each facility, or $54 
million. This is equivalent to an annual cost of $5.1 million under each proposed option. For 
FCTs and AHFDSs, we assume these costs are subsumed in the management costs for these 
systems (see Appendix A for details).   
3.7 Summary – Total Annual Compliance Costs 
In total, EPA estimates that the Preferred Option for the proposed rule will produce 
incremental costs of approximately $210 million per year compared to the current regulatory 
baseline. Exhibit 3-9 summarizes these costs per category. Regardless of the option, 
conventional UST systems will incur over 65 percent of these costs.  Costs to AHFDSs and 
FCTs comprise approximately 11 percent and 29 percent of total costs under the Preferred 
Option and Alternative 1, respectively.

Virgin Islands will also incur these costs.

Limitations of Compliance Cost Analysis 
While EPA has taken steps to present a sound analysis of compliance costs, it recognizes 
that certain assumptions and limitations are inherent to this assessment. 
Tank configuration: This analysis assumes that a particular configuration of equipment 
represents the average UST system. This assumption affects the compliance costs of the 
proposed rule because systems with different configurations (e.g., more sumps per tank) could 
have different costs.  Mischaracterizing this configuration may under- or overstate total costs as 
well as system-level costs.  
System-level compliance costs: As discussed in Section 3.3, system-level compliance 
costs are based on public information, input from UST industry professionals, and EPA 
professional judgment, all of which are assumed to provide the most accurate available data at 
the time of this proposal. EPA recognizes that these data sometimes reflect only a small number 
of sources, and are therefore characterized by uncertainty.  
As a result of these uncertainties, the precise cost of the proposed rule may differ from 
the estimate generated by EPA’s analysis. The above sensitivity analyses, though not strictly 
additive, suggest that the outside range of cost uncertainty is approximately 50 percent from 
EPA’s central estimates. Moreover, because EPA’s estimate is framed by a number of 
conservative assumptions (outlined in section 3.3), it is unlikely that this analysis understates the 
costs of the proposed rule significantly.

3.7.1 Summary – Total Annual Compliance Costs under the Alternative Baseline 
Scenario 
Under the alternative baseline universe assumption described in Section 3.3.1, EPA 
estimates that the Preferred Option for the proposed rule will produce incremental costs of 
approximately $200 million per year compared to $210 million in annual costs in the primary 
analysis. Exhibit 3-10 summarizes these costs per category. Regardless of the option, 
conventional UST systems will incur over 65 percent of these costs.  Costs to AHFDSs and 
FCTs comprise approximately 11 percent and 30 percent of total costs under the Preferred 
Option and Alternative 1, respectively.

Chapter 4.  Assessment of Benefits And Cost Savings 
4.1 Introduction  
The beneficial impacts of a regulatory change are typically measured in two ways:  as 
“social benefits” that usually take the form of reduced environmental damage, reduced human 
health risk, and improvements in the value of environmental amenities.  Benefits also include 
avoided costs associated with reduced need for cleanup and avoided costs of “averting behavior” 
(e.g., obtaining replacement water supplies).  Ideally, social benefits reflect accurate measures of 
the total “willingness to pay” (WTP) of consumers to obtain improvements in environmental 
quality.  In other cases, avoided costs (e.g., medical care) can be used to inform proxy estimates 
of WTP when direct estimates of WTP are unavailable.  In the context of this rule, EPA 
examines social benefits and separately considers the avoided costs associated with reduced need 
for cleanup of releases because reliable WTP estimates for the value of an avoided cleanup are 
not available, and because avoided costs represent a real economic cost savings.   
This chapter describes the approaches used to evaluate avoided remediation (cleanup) 
costs and other benefits.  It first outlines several different methods attempted for measuring 
benefits and cost savings, and describes the final selected method (expert consultation) in detail.  
Next, it provides a description of monetized cost savings and other benefits, including avoided 
cleanup costs, avoided vapor damage cleanup estimates, avoided product loss, and the value of 
avoided cancer risk associated with anticipated reductions in releases and reductions in severity 
of releases.  The chapter then presents a screening-level analysis of the quantity of groundwater 
potentially protected by the regulations.  Finally, we provide a qualitative discussion of 
ecological and other human health benefits. 
4.2 Investigation of Empirical Methods for Measuring Benefits and Cost Savings 
 The benefits and cost savings of the proposed rule result from the reduced incidence and 
size of releases that would occur due to the new requirements.  EPA examined a number of ways 
to use quantitative, empirical data on release rates, inspection effectiveness, and program 
performance to estimate directly the changes in releases that could be expected under the 
proposed rule.  This section describes the different data sources and methods considered, and the 
limitations of each. 
 
4.2.1 Engineering Estimates and Literature  
 One approach to estimating the benefits of the proposed rule would be to develop an 
engineering model of the release rates associated with equipment and practices before and after 
the implementation of the rule requirements.  However, this approach would address only a small 
number of the proposed rule components because most of the requirements are not focused on 
equipment modifications, but instead call for inspections, testing, and maintenance.  These are 
requirements for changes in human behavior, and are not easily measured using equipment 
testing.    
 
 
 
 
4-2 
 This suggests that EPA could best measure benefits empirically by examining studies of 
how changing frequencies in inspection and testing would lead to different leak rates.  Therefore, 
EPA conducted a targeted literature review of engineering literature and studies of the 
effectiveness of testing and inspection programs.  We were unable to identify any studies directly 
applicable to the proposed UST regulations, but we did identify EPA and published literature on 
the effects of better inspection and testing rates more generally. We summarize several key 
studies below.   
• California study of impact of secondary containment on UST system releases 
(2002):1  This study examined whether use of secondary containment throughout 
UST systems resulted in differences in release rates.  The study’s conclusions 
were hampered by a limited sample size, and authors note that releases from other 
parts of the systems may have affected results.  The study did not find a 
significant relationship between secondary containment and release rates at sites, 
but did find that facility-level factors (e.g., improper installations) made it more 
likely than expected that all systems at a facility would either have or lack 
releases.  While the study cannot be used to directly estimate the benefits 
associated with the proposed regulation, its conclusions suggest that regulations 
focusing on effective facility-level inspections may be well-targeted. 
• National Research Council study of effectiveness of state vehicle emissions 
inspection and maintenance programs (2001):2  This study reviewed four state 
programs and one city program aimed at reducing motor vehicle emissions by 
requiring inspections and maintenance.  While the study did not address UST 
systems, the structure of vehicle inspection programs is similar to the proposed 
regulations in that both require owners/operators to undertake routine inspections 
and undertake maintenance as needed.  The study found that the programs had a 
measureable impact on ambient air quality, but did not identify whether the 
differences were statistically significant.3  While the results do not provide a 
quantitative basis for estimating the impacts of the proposed rule, the study 
suggests that mandatory inspection programs can reduce emissions.   
• Environmental Results Program (ERP) data:4 Data from several 
environmental results programs (ERPs) show a statistically significant

Inspection and Maintenance Programs, National Academy Press, 2001. 
3 The study also concluded that the programs had more modest impacts than those predicted by air quality 
modeling, but this finding is of limited relevance to the current regulation, since no ambient conditions modeling has 
been conducted.

improvement in verified compliance as a result of a combination of self-
certification, technical assistance, and inspections.  While these programs do not 
isolate the impact of specific regulatory changes, the results are consistent with 
other findings that programs that rely in part on self-implemented inspections and 
reporting can reduce noncompliance. 
In general, the literature does not address UST inspection programs directly, and does not 
provide quantitative results that can be used to estimate the impacts of the proposed rule.  
However, the literature does provide data that generally indicate that self-implementing 
inspection programs (with external validation) do have an impact on equipment maintenance, 
and generally lead to a reduction in environmental impacts.  This suggests that some positive 
impact should be expected from the proposed rule. 
4.2.2 Statistical Analysis of State Release Data  
 A different approach to a robust analysis of benefits would be to develop a database of 
State UST rules and reported release rates before and after the effective dates of rules similar to 
the proposed rule.  With good quality data, one could combine these rules and reported release 
rates and isolate the marginal impacts of various components of the proposed rule.  To collect 
detailed data at the facility level, however, would require visiting state UST programs 
individually and collecting detailed site inspection data from state case files and archives.  Not 
only would such an effort be prohibitive in terms of available resources, but our current 
knowledge of the state programs suggests that variable inspection practices and changes in 
record-keeping practices over time may limit the ability of the exercise to provide robust results. 
 In the absence of site-specific data, however, we collected and examined data on state 
regulatory programs and reported releases from available aggregate sources.  Specifically, we 
identified and evaluated data from the following sources:  
• Leak Autopsy Reports:  In 2004 and 2005, EPA released two draft “leak 
autopsy” studies (“the draft 23-state Autopsy Report” and a separate study 
examining the State of Florida).  These studies examined the sources and extent of 
releases that occurred in systems that were compliant with the 1998 standards, 
and identifies the extent to which different baseline releases are associated with 
failures of equipment in different parts of the UST system (e.g., piping, overfill 
protection equipment).5   
• State Regulatory and Report Data:  State programs are required to report 
aggregated information to EPA on the number of active UST systems, the number 
of inspections, and the number of confirmed releases reported in each six-month

period.6  In addition, EPA obtained information about state regulatory programs 
and the effective dates for state requirements that are similar to the requirements 
of the proposed rule.   
Using the available data, EPA examined several different statistical approaches, focusing on 
regression analysis, to compile and examine a set of state-level data that included the number of 
UST systems in each state in a given year, the number of releases from UST systems in each 
year, the number of UST inspections conducted in each year, and the presence or absence of 
regulations designed to prevent releases.   
Before conducting regression analysis on the data set of state USTs and releases, EPA 
first adjusted the data to account for a number of data quality concerns.  A key data concern was 
the relationship between states with low-frequency inspections and states reporting small 
numbers of confirmed releases.  To ensure that the reported UST releases accurately reflected 
most or all releases taking place, EPA developed an index that scored each state based on the 
frequency of inspections.  States that reported inspection rates less frequent than every five years, 
and/or inconsistent inspection frequencies over time, were removed from the sample, based on 
the assumption that release data from those states may be less reliable due to less frequent third 
party verification (i.e., state inspection) of system operations.  In other words, we assume that 
owners/operators may be less inclined to report releases or properly maintain their equipment if 
they are in a state where inspections occur infrequently or inconsistently. 
In conducting the analysis, however, EPA identified several fundamental problems with 
available data that limit the value of a regression analysis approach.  These include significant 
data availability and reliability issues related to the limited number of observations and 
programmatic changes among states that prevent the isolation of regulation-related impacts.  
Specifically:   
• Consistent, accurate release data are not available.  It is likely that measurement 
error exists in the recording of confirmed releases across states (the dependent 
variable) and that it is related in some systematic way to the regulatory structure 
of the state or other explanatory variables (as opposed to random reporting error) 
in the analysis.  In addition, state inspections vary in timing and focus across 
states; this, in turn, affects the consistency of third-party verified compliance and 
release information.  While EPA attempted to account for this by selecting only 
states with a high frequency of inspections for inclusion in the analysis, the 
interaction between inspection frequency and degree and effectiveness of 
regulation creates sample selection problems (i.e., states with higher release rates 
due to limited regulation may also be states that do not conduct frequent 
inspections and therefore have less reliable data).7  Therefore, normal regression 
                                                          
6    Data can be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/oust/cat/camarchv.htm. 
7 As noted above, the only reliable approach to identify the relationship between inspection frequency, 
compliance, and number of releases would require a large-scale data collection effort.  In absence of this, we use 
inspection frequency as an indicator of reliable data.

properties do not hold, and results may be biased in ways that do not allow for a 
reliable interpretation.8   
• Many regulations consistent with the proposed rule are currently in place in only a 
small number of states.  EPA addressed limited variation in the presence of 
regulations by dropping several regulatory variables from the analysis, but the 
resulting lack of variation and the small number of observations make it likely 
that regulatory indicators will proxy for other relevant characteristics of that state. 
• Study design is limited by available data.  Ideally, an analysis of the effectiveness 
of UST leak prevention regulations would employ observations from a large 
number of states over a time period that includes years before and after 
regulations were in place.  Such “panel” data would allow for identification of 
impacts temporally and spatially.  Panel data would also allow for fixed-effects 
estimation, which controls for any unobserved characteristics of states that might 
affect release rates (such as soil pH or climate), independent of any effect of 
regulation.  Available data superficially appear to be panel data, since they 
provide information on the number or rate of releases from different states in 
multiple time periods, along with information on the presence or absence of UST 
regulations by state.  However, for many regulations it is unclear both when the 
regulation was first promulgated and when the effects of the regulation would be 
expected to be fully realized (e.g., through inspections).   
As discussed in more detail in Appendix F, quantitative analysis of annual UST releases 
by state did not reveal a consistent measure of the potential impact of release prevention 
regulations.  The data limitations noted above prevented the use of the preferred method of fixed 
effects estimation using panel data.  In the absence of fixed-effects estimation, the analysis 
cannot reliably draw conclusions about the impacts of regulations on releases, independent of 
any unmeasured characteristics of states that could be affecting the number of releases in each 
state.  In other words, in addition to data quality issues discussed above, the small number of 
states with specific UST release prevention regulations prevents identification of robust 
relationships between individual regulations and the number of releases per year. 
However, through cross-sectional analysis, EPA was able to estimate that release rates in 
California and Florida – two states with mature UST regulation regimes – were about 55-65 
percent less than one would expect based on release rates at other states during the time period 
examined.   This difference could serve as an upper bound for the potential of leak prevention 
regulations to reduce the rate of UST releases.9 
                                                          
8   For example, several regressions found an apparent positive, statistically significant relationship between 
secondary containment requirements and the number of releases per year.  However, empirical data from Florida 
indicate that secondary containment contributes to release reductions of as much as 50 percent. 
9 Exhibit 6 in Appendix F shows the degree to which the actual number of releases in Florida and California 
in 2009, 2005, and from 2002 to 2006 is less than the number of releases that would be expected based on the 
release rates observed at other states.  In 2005 and 2009, the years in which the dummy variable for California was 
statistically significant from zero, California had between 56 and 63 percent fewer releases than would be expected 
based on the regression analysis.  In 2002-2006, when the period in which the dummy variable for Florida was 
statistically significant from zero, Florida had between 60 and 65 percent fewer releases than would be expected.  
EPA strongly cautions against generalizing these results beyond the states included in the analysis.  However, these

4.3 Final Methodology for Assessment of Positive Impacts: Expert Consultation 
To estimate the individual effects of each proposed regulatory change, and in light of the 
absence of applicable engineering models and limited empirical state data, we resorted to a 
consultation with five experts with experience in regulation of USTs and implementation of state 
inspection programs.  The remainder of this chapter describes in detail the final methodology 
used to identify reductions in releases associated with the proposed rule, and the calculation of 
cost savings associated with those avoided releases. 
To ensure that the assessment of regulatory effects relied on broad expertise in regulatory 
implementation, EPA developed a pool of technical experts with national reputations for 
leadership in implementation of underground storage tank regulatory programs, or with extensive 
expertise in assessing spill causation at UST sites.  From this pool, several experts were 
interviewed and five experts were identified.  Each of the identified experts has over 20 years of 
experience in the regulation, assessment, and/or remediation of underground storage tanks, 
including direction of state programs and implementation of regulations similar to some aspects 
of the proposed regulation. 
EPA provided an identical set of written questions separately to each expert and 
conducted individual follow-up telephone interviews to clarify and verify responses.  Appendix 
G provides a detailed explanation of the process EPA followed in identifying experts, more 
detailed information about the qualifications of the experts, and an explanation of the factors 
EPA considered when including and excluding expert feedback. Appendix H provides the 
questions distributed to experts and their responses. 
One of the five experts did not provide input consistent with EPA’s analytical methods, 
and as a result his quantitative estimates were not usable. Specifically, his baseline estimate of 
releases was not consistent with EPA’s, and he was not able to provide information on how to 
extrapolate to EPA’s universe.  In addition, his responses included apparent internal 
inconsistencies that could not be reconciled without collecting more information about baseline 
releases.10  We therefore believe the opinions of the remaining four experts provide the best 
available data on the expected impact of the proposed rule.  
Avoided Costs as a Measure of Beneficial Impacts 
Avoided remediation costs provide the basis for a substantial portion of the beneficial 
impacts associated with the proposed rule.  Avoided remediation costs represent cost savings that 
accrue to owners, operators and public entities charged with remediating releases at regulated 
facilities.11  While avoided remediation costs are not a direct measure of total willingness to pay 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
numbers do suggest an upper bound of potential avoided leaks associated with the operation of the mature, relatively 
stringent programs in both California and Florida.   
10  The expert also provided clear opinions about the optimal regulatory structure and suggested that his 
answers were not reliable unless the regulatory language was amended to include specific technical requirements.  
This created additional uncertainty in the interpretation of his results. 
11 Chapter 5 provides a more detailed discussion on the potential positive effect of the proposed rule on 
state financial assurance funds.

for environmental improvements, and are therefore not equivalent to social benefits, they 
represent real economic cost savings due to reduced demand for baseline remediation.12 
Calculation of Annual Positive Impacts  
The analysis presents the positive effects of the proposed rule as a constant, recurring, 
annual value for analytical convenience. The timing of the positive impacts of the rule is 
uncertain for several reasons: 
• As shown in Exhibit 1-2 in Chapter 1, the proposed changes do not take effect 
simultaneously.  
• Irrespective of when they take effect, the changes may require varying lengths of 
time to achieve full effect.  
• EPA relies on its reported confirmed releases to calculate the reductions due to 
the proposed rule. Confirmed releases recorded in a particular evaluation year 
vary significantly in severity and length of time undetected, which introduces 
variability in the extent to which costs are avoided each year.   
• The proposed rule includes activities such as: frequent inspections and equipment 
testing to prevent, identify and address releases; near-term shifts in technology; 
and long-term changes in technology. Each class of changes necessarily focuses 
on release avoidance and mitigation over different time horizons.  
 
In the absence of detailed data characterizing releases by age and type, EPA assumes that 
implementation of the proposed regulations will have a uniform annual impact, with beneficial 
impacts realized on the last day of the year in which costs are incurred (i.e., a one-year delay). 
For equipment that is phased in over a period of time, we assume that positive impacts accrue at 
the same rate as installation and adjust those impacts so that they are constant over time.13    
4.3.1 Avoided Remediation Costs  
This section explains how EPA arrives at its estimates of avoided remediation costs.14 
EPA first explains how it calculates avoided remediation costs based on the source of a release. 
This is followed by a discussion of the methods used to calculate the number of releases avoided 
and the number of releases for which severity is mitigated. Finally, the two elements are 
combined to estimate the total avoided remediation cost due to the proposed rule. 
                                                          
12 Economists commonly define social benefits as the sum of individuals’ willingness to pay to obtain a 
good or service or avoid an unwanted outcome. Avoided remediation costs may not equal willingness to pay. 
13 See Appendix I for detailed explanation of this methodology. 
14 We refer to avoided cleanup costs and avoided remediation costs interchangeably throughout this 
document.

4.3.2 Calculating Avoided Remediation Costs 
This analysis values avoided releases according to their cost of remediation. EPA 
developed average remediation costs for the four general release size categories reported in the 
draft 23-state Autopsy Report.  The four categories generally conform with classification 
conventions used by state LUST offices, and the autopsy reports presented leak frequency data 
for different UST system components for each of the categories. The four categories include: 
• Local site extent with soil contamination; 
• Local site extent with water contamination;15 
• Large site extent with soil contamination; and 
• Large site extent with water contamination.16 
EPA obtained remediation costs aligned with each of these size categories from a survey 
of state LUST offices and calculated average expected remediation costs for each of the release 
categories outlined in the draft 23-state Autopsy Report (Exhibit 4-1).17 Remediation costs 
associated with groundwater remediation are generally higher than costs for soil remediation. 
Administrative, response, and oversight costs were provided by New Hampshire, and 
remediation costs reflect an average of the costs provided by New Hampshire and Utah.18,19   
 
                                                          
15 Water contamination refers to both groundwater and surface water contamination, though groundwater 
contamination is more common than surface water contamination. 
16 While no specific definition exists for a large site, the LUST Autopsy survey instruments used by the 
states generally define large sites as those with contamination that extends beyond the extent of construction 
excavation.  In addition, EPA classified sites with off-site contamination as large sites. 
17 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Underground Storage Tanks, “Evaluation of Releases 
from New and Upgraded Underground Storage Tank Systems,” draft, August 2004. 
18 To develop an avoided cleanup cost estimate, EPA collected data from Montana, New Hampshire, New 
Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia, all of which use state financial assurance funds to pay for LUST 
remediation.  Each state UST program office received a questionnaire requesting data on typical cleanup costs 
broken out by the four general release types; New Hampshire, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia 
provided responses.  New Hampshire provided the most comprehensive set of information., including cleanup costs 
by category (i.e., administrative, response, remediation, and oversight), while New Mexico and Utah could only 
provide estimates of remediation costs.  Virginia and South Carolina were unable to provide the detail required for 
this analysis, as neither state was able to break out costs by the extent of release (i.e., large or small). 
19 New Mexico data are excluded from the calculation for two reasons. First, large-extent groundwater 
cleanup cost estimates from New Mexico are much higher than those for other states ($2.5 million compared with 
$0.6 million or less for other states) but the state did not provide data on the number or type of sites that resulted in 
this high estimate of costs.  Second, New Mexico has a relatively small number of UST systems (3,958 UST 
systems as of September 30, 2009).  As a result, we believe that New Mexico may be atypical and could skew 
results to overstate avoided costs. We therefore do not include its results among the average avoided costs of 
remediation.

provide data on the number or type of sites that resulted in this high estimate of costs.  Second, New Mexico has a relatively 
small number of UST systems (3,958 UST systems as of September 30, 2009).  As a result, New Mexico’s costs may be 
atypical and could skew results to overstate avoided costs.

EPA then used the average cost data from states to develop weighted average costs 
associated with remediation of releases from different portions of the UST system, based on 
release frequency data for each source.  Exhibit 4-2 presents, for each of the release sources 
identified in the draft 23-state Autopsy Report, the probability of a release by LUST category.20  
Using the cost data from Exhibit 4-1, EPA estimates a weighted average avoided cost per release 
size by multiplying the cost per site by the probability of each release type.  These are summed 
across the categories to obtain the weighted average cost by release source.21, 22

and Florida releases, and may therefore be skewed slightly if those more stringent and established programs have 
smaller releases.  We are unable to adjust the data to correct for this, but its impact, if any, would likely be to reduce 
the average size and cost of releases slightly.

Estimate Avoided Costs Associated with a Typical UST Leak,” IEc Memorandum to EPA, prepared by Aaron 
Kamholtz, Neal Etre, and Cynthia Manson, October 27, 2008. 
22 If we calculate a weighted-average cost per release where sources are weighted proportionally by their 
contribution to total releases, we obtain an overall average cost per release of approximately $143,000 (See memo in 
Appendix I for details). For reference, ASTSWMO estimates the average cost per site to be roughly $127,000 in 
2009. See Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials, State Fund Survey Results 2009.

4.4 Establishing Avoided Releases 
To estimate the number of baseline releases that would be either avoided completely or 
reduced in severity as a result of the proposed rule, experts responded to a common set of 
questions about potential impacts of the regulatory changes under consideration and participated 
in follow-on discussions on specific areas of uncertainty.  
Each expert reviewed the proposed requirements and estimated how they would affect the 
following dimensions of releases: 23  
1. Changes in total frequency (number) of annual confirmed releases; 
2. Changes in the number of remaining releases that reach groundwater; 
3. Changes in the average quantity released among remaining releases; and, 
4. Changes in the average duration of release among remaining releases. 
Experts had the option of expressing reductions in release size in terms of duration or 
volume (quantity) of product, depending on how they typically collected and reviewed release 
data.  In addition, experts were given the option of expressing these changes either: 1) as a total 
                                                          
23 EPA did not provide experts with information about the universe of facilities or costs associated with 
remediation; experts did, however, have access to information about the number of confirmed releases and their 
distribution across different parts of the UST system (e.g., tanks, pipes, and STP areas).  EPA uses confirmed 
releases as the baseline estimate of total releases because high quality data on total releases are not available, and 
release confirmation triggers the remediation costs that would be avoided.   
 
 
 
 
4-11 
national estimate that accounted for variation in existing regulation and technology among states 
and facilities, or 2) as a change applied to a specific subset of the tank universe (e.g., 10 percent 
change among tanks with a certain technology that are not currently regulated). 
Experts also estimated the sensitivity of results to changes in the frequency of regulatory 
requirements (e.g., the impact of inspections occurring at different intervals, consistent with 
different regulatory options) and noted synergies or dependencies between requirements, such as:  
• Dependency between equipment upgrades and walkthrough inspections: Experts 
consistently noted that simply replacing equipment with newer technologies (e.g., 
requiring that new systems have secondary containment) is insufficient for 
preventing all releases. Regular visual inspections are necessary to identify 
potential problems and ensure timely maintenance when a release has not yet 
occurred.  
• Synergy between equipment maintenance and walkthrough inspections:  Experts 
noted that the combination of operability testing and visual (walkthrough) 
inspections would result in more avoided releases by identifying equipment 
problems quickly and ensuring effective maintenance.  
• Dependency between operator training and walkthrough inspections:  Experts 
noted that training alone is not adequate to ensure effective site maintenance, and 
walkthrough inspection requirements are not effective without trained staff.  As a 
result, all experts assumed that impacts related to walkthrough inspections 
reflected trained staff and did not separately identify release reductions associated 
with training. 
 Experts provided separate estimates of impacts for each regulatory requirement.  EPA 
then used these requirement-specific estimates to calculate total avoided costs for the proposed 
rule.24  It is important to note, however, that when considering inter-relationships among 
regulatory requirements, experts differed in how they isolated and/or “allocated” impacts across 
specific requirements because the allocation of impacts across different regulatory requirements 
could potentially be interpreted in several ways (e.g., one expert might decide that inspections 
drove all impacts, while another might decide that testing was the primary factor).  EPA 
                                                          
24 Experts were also asked to provide an estimate of the “total cumulative impact” for the proposed rule in 
aggregate as well.  The analysis then compared the effects of simultaneously applying the requirement specific 
estimates with their total estimate of the overall effect of the proposed rule. This was performed to verify the 
experts’ logic and identify areas of overlap or synergy among the regulatory requirements.  However, subsequent to 
receiving responses from experts, EPA made slight modifications to the list of regulatory requirements (e.g., experts 
were asked to consider impacts of an annual overfill prevention equipment test, but EPA is now proposing 3-year 
tests).  While EPA was able to adjust the requirement specific estimate of these slight revisions based on the 
sensitivity responses from the experts and follow-up questioning, the original “total cumulative impact” estimates 
provided by the experts are no longer representative of the current proposed rule as a whole.  We note, though, that 
the average of cumulative estimates was generally consistent with (i.e., within 10 percent of) the equivalent 
requirement-specific impacts. 
 
 
 
 
4-12 
therefore avoids emphasis on the requirement-specific estimates provided by each expert, and 
considers their results in total.25,26 
In general, EPA applies the most conservative estimates presented by the experts and 
adjusts for the number of affected units where appropriate. In cases where reductions involved a 
range of values, EPA typically selected the low end of the range. Where experts’ comments 
reflect qualitative assumptions that substantially affect their quantitative estimates, the analysis 
acknowledges those factors as caveats to estimated rates of release avoidance.  
To calculate the number of releases completely avoided as a result of potential regulatory 
changes, EPA combines the estimated reductions as identified by experts with a release 
distribution based on data from the draft 23-state Autopsy Report (see Appendix I for more 
detail).  To estimate changes in release severity, the analysis uses the distribution of releases 
from the same report to quantify the number of groundwater releases avoided due to reduced 
release volume. Exhibit 4-3 provides a summary of our findings with respect to avoided 
releases.  Experts’ responses suggest that the Preferred Option of the proposed rule will avoid 
approximately 20 percent to 60 percent of 7,168 annual releases, or roughly 1,400 to 4,300 
releases in evaluation year 2009. In addition,as summarized in Exhibit 4-4, of the remaining 
releases, approximately 330 to 1,100 releases would be reduced in severity (i.e., these releases 
would remain soil contamination only).  ).27

verified that he believed the rule would result in avoidance of over half of confirmed releases. 
 
 
                                                          
25  Note that EPA carefully examined and reviewed each requirement-specific estimate from each expert, 
and verified the results and assumptions with each expert, particularly in cases where results reflect a wide range. 
26 Consistent with the approach adopted for the cost analysis, EPA asked experts to estimate reductions in 
releases and release severity assuming that owners/operators would comply fully with all new regulations under the 
proposed rule.   To the extent that non-compliance occurs, both costs and cost savings estimated in this RIA may be 
overstated.    It is also possible that some expert opinions on specific rule impacts may not completely capture full 
compliance (and may therefore understate the impacts of the proposed rule), because the experience of most experts 
is related to implementing state regulatory programs and one issue encountered has been non-compliance.  However, 
experts asserted that their estimates approximate full compliance, and we do not therefore attempt to adjust for non-
compliance in either cost or cost-savings calculations. 
27 EPA assumes that these groundwater releases will instead become soil releases. Hypothetically, if 
releases are proportionally split as 50 percent groundwater and 50 percent soil before the rule takes effect, they will 
be split 38 percent groundwater and 62 percent soil after the rule.

4.4.1 Avoided Releases Using an Alternative Baseline 
EPA’s primary analysis assumes that the universe of confirmed releases from UST 
systems remains constant over the time frame of the analysis. However, both the universe of 
UST systems and the release rate (defined as the number of confirmed releases divided by the 
number of UST systems in a given year) have declined over the last two decades.28 This is 
consistent with the regulatory context of the past 20 years, in which two key factors have been 
driving the number of releases.  First, the universe of UST systems has been declining as older, 
smaller tanks have been replaced by newer, larger systems.  Second, many of the confirmed 
releases reported in the 1990s and early 2000s were “legacy” releases associated with older 
systems that did not meet the technical standards under 40 CFR Part 280 (e.g., tanks that were 
installed prior to the promulgation of the UST regulation at 40 CFR Part 280).  Many of these 
legacy releases are discovered when tanks are removed during property transactions and other 
development projects.   
As the number of legacy releases has declined, the declining trend in total releases has 
“flattened” – trend data suggest that release rates have been approximately one confirmed release 
per hundred tanks in recent years.  In addition, it is possible that confirmed releases may increase 
in future years, as UST systems continue to age, and as new fuel blends with potentially higher 
corrosivity are introduced into the industry.  Given this uncertainty, EPA assumes in the  primary 
analysis that release rates remain constant.   
However, to address the uncertainty associated with the number of confirmed releases, 
EPA also assesses avoided costs under the proposed rule using an alternative baseline that 
projects a continued decline in the release rate consistent with the recent historical trend, and also 
captures the decline in the number of UST systems as estimated in Chapter 3, Section 3.3.1.  
This represents a conservative avoided cost scenario because it does not account for the 
possibility that aging systems or changes in fuel could result in increases in the number of 
                                                          
28 See Appendix J for charts and data sources that demonstrate these two trends. 
 
 
 
 
4-14 
confirmed releases reported, or that the number of UST systems could increase (if, for example, 
an expanding economy or population growth demands more service locations).   
To estimate the rate of universe decline, EPA mapped historical data on the number of 
UST systems from 1991 through 2010 to an exponential one-phase decay function, which 
appears to most accurately represent the observed behavior of the UST system universe over 
time.29 EPA also mapped historical data on the release rate to a similar decay function. 30 These 
two functions were then used to project future UST universe sizes as well as future release rates. 
We used the results from these two projections to estimate future number of confirmed 
releases.31 
The cumulative universe of releases over 20 years under this alternative baseline is 
approximately 60 percent of the number of cumulative releases over 20 years in the primary 
analysis. The alternative baseline contains proportionally fewer releases than UST systems 
because two separate declining trends, UST systems and release rate, are used to estimate the 
future decline in releases. This compounds the projected decline in releases. 
Exhibits 4-5 and 4-6 provide a summary of our findings with respect to avoided releases 
and avoided groundwater contamination events, respectively, assuming the alternative baseline 
releases occur. The alternative baseline results in a reduction of roughly 40 percent of both 
avoided releases and avoided groundwater contamination relative to the original baseline. 
Correspondingly, in the alternative baseline scenario, approximately 810 to 2,600 releases are 
avoided under the Preferred Option, compared to 900 to 2,800 under Alternative 1 and 250 to 
2,000 under Alternative 2. Under the alternative baseline, there are approximately 200 to 650 
avoided groundwater contamination incidents under the Preferred Option, 190 to 700 under 
Alternative 1, and 130 to 320 under Alternative 2. 
 
                                                          
29 See Section 3.3.1. 
30 To estimate future release rates, we used a single exponential decay function, which assumes that a 
quantity declines at a rate proportional to its value. This is an appropriate function given the singular and slowing 
rate of decline observed in the release rate over time. The equation for such an exponential singular decay function 
is Y = (Yo – P) * e(-k*X) + P, where P represents the “plateau,” or limit of the function and k represents the function’s 
half-life.  See Appendix J for additional details. 
31 We use release rates to project future number of releases (rather than use past trends in the number of 
confirmed releases) for two reasons:  First, as the UST universe and release rate both appear to decline in a way 
approximating a single-decay exponential function, these projections can be used to estimate future number of 
releases without the added uncertainty of whether the release trend is truly a single-decay exponential function.  In 
addition, using the release rate projections to estimate future releases yields a more conservative (lower) total 
number of releases than if we were to use the past trend in the number of releases, which leads to more conservative 
(lower) avoided remediation cost estimates in the alternative baseline.

4.5 Benefits from Avoided Releases and Reduced Release Severity 
Two sources of avoided costs constitute the majority of quantifiable positive impacts 
from the proposed rule. First, some costs related to release remediation costs do not occur 
because a number of releases are altogether avoided. Second, some remaining releases are 
reduced in severity because of the proposed requirements (e.g., through earlier detection through 
via walkthrough inspections and improved operability of release detection equipment). To 
capture this dimension of avoided costs, the analysis relies on incremental avoided groundwater 
remediation costs—the cost to remediate a groundwater release less the cost to remediate a soil 
release—as groundwater releases are generally more costly to remediate than soil releases.  
In addition to avoiding remediation costs, release prevention and mitigation results in a 
variety of other beneficial impacts, including: 
• Avoided vapor intrusion damages; 
• Avoided product loss; 
• Human health benefits; 
 
 
 
 
4-16 
• Ecological benefits; and 
• Protection of groundwater quality. 
This section monetizes, quantifies, or otherwise describes these impacts. 
4.5.1 Avoided Release Remediation 
To determine the benefits of avoided releases, the analysis relies on the draft 23-state 
Autopsy Report’s distribution of releases by source (i.e., the part of the UST system that 
produces the release), and applies the reduction associated with each regulation to the 
appropriate source to reduce the number of releases avoided by source.32,33  Each avoided release 
is valued according to the weighted average of remediation costs shown in Exhibit 4-2.34  
Exhibit 4-7 presents the total avoided remediation costs under each regulatory option. 
We estimate that discounted benefits from avoided remediation costs range between 
approximately $170 million and $570 under the Preferred Option, while avoided costs amount to 
between $190 million and $610 million under Alternative 1 and between $54 million and $440 
million under Alternative 2.

Range $170 - $570 $190 - $610 $54 - $440 
Note: Cost estimates were derived using a seven percent discount rate.    
 
4.5.2 Reduction in Release Severity  
To assess the impact on remediation costs associated with reduced release severity, the 
analysis focuses on changes in the number of releases that would have involved groundwater in 
the baseline, but because of the proposed rule, involve only soil. While this metric does not 
capture all of the release mitigation effects of the proposed requirements, groundwater avoidance 
                                                          
32 We exclude the ‘Other’ category of releases from the draft 23-state Autopsy Report because it does not 
map to the reductions designated by the experts. Because ’Other’ accounts for only 1 percent of releases in the 
study, we distribute those releases proportionally across the remaining release sources. 
33 We use five system sources to identify release types: piping, dispenser, tank, sump turbine pump area, 
and delivery problems. We then assign each regulation’s effect to source types based on the regulation (e.g. spill 
prevention equipment tests are assumed to affect releases from delivery problems).  
34 This approach assumes that avoided releases are well-represented by the distribution of release severity 
that is identified in the draft 23-state Autopsy Report. 
 
 
 
 
4-17 
is likely to be among the most significant effects of the rule. The difference in remediation costs 
between soil and groundwater releases is substantial: remediation cost for an average 
groundwater release is approximately $270,000, while an average soil release costs 
approximately $70,000 to remediate.35  Remediation costs across release extent and medium 
contaminated range from $25,250 to $428,200 based on typical site remediation costs from New 
Hampshire and Utah.36 
To estimate the number of releases that are reduced in severity, we use experts’ estimates 
of reductions in groundwater involvement and distribute them across release source, medium 
contaminated, and release extent.37 We distribute remaining releases according to the draft 23-
state Autopsy Report results and calculate additional benefits from remediation due to reductions 
in groundwater contamination following the regulation. We calculate avoided costs from reduced 
release severity by subtracting the cost to remediate all remaining releases after the proposed rule 
is in effect from the cost to remediate all remaining releases in the baseline. In both cases, we 
remove from consideration the same number of fully-avoided releases and consider only the 
avoided costs from shifting releases from groundwater to soil. 
A key limitation of this approach may lead to a conservative estimate of the effects of the 
proposed rule. The analysis assumes that the distribution of releases across size (i.e., extent) does 
not change as a consequence of changes in groundwater contamination. In reality, changes in the 
likelihood of groundwater contamination are probably (at least in part) a consequence of 
reductions in release volume and duration. The same reductions in release volume that lower the 
incidence of groundwater contamination would likely also reduce the number of large extent 
releases of all types and decrease the average size of smaller releases. That is, new requirements 
should both reduce the number of groundwater contamination events and large extent events of 
all types. Our model captures only changes in the rates of groundwater contamination, and does 
not consider cost savings associated with smaller soil-only sites. We therefore likely understate 
avoided remediation costs.38 
Exhibit 4-8 displays EPA’s findings regarding discounted avoided costs due to the 
mitigation of groundwater incidents. The analysis calculates avoided remediation costs by taking 
the difference between estimated remediation costs before and after the proposed changes are 
implemented. This difference accounts for both the reduction in groundwater release incidents as 
                                                          
35 These costs reflect a simple average of the costs to remediate a large extent and local extent release of 
each medium. 
36 Release extent is classified in the draft 23-state Autopsy Report as either local or large. Releases that do 
not extend beyond the area excavated during remediation are considered local, while releases that extend beyond 
property lines are considered large. Extent does not explicitly involve a measure of release volume.  
37 See Appendix I for details on the calculation of avoided costs. 
38  A change in the distribution of releases could also potentially cause the “average size” and cost of soil-
only releases to increase (because larger groundwater releases are eliminated but become “large” local soil-only 
releases).  While this could result in higher average costs for local releases, (i.e., the cost savings for avoiding a 
groundwater release might be less than the difference between “average” groundwater and soil releases), the 
analysis also does not consider the cost savings associated with reducing the size of groundwater releases that still 
reach groundwater or the cost savings associated with reducing the size of soil releases.  
 
 
 
 
4-18 
well as the increase in soil contamination events.39 EPA estimates that benefits from averted 
groundwater releases range from approximately $61 million to $270 million across regulatory 
options. Avoided costs from reduced groundwater contamination are additive to avoided costs 
from avoided releases.

 Exhibits 4-10 and 4-11 present avoided remediation costs associated with the avoided 
releases and avoided groundwater incidents shown in Exhibits 4-5 and 4-6. In the alternative 
baseline scenario, avoided release remediation costs range from $100 million to $340 million 
                                                          
39 This occurs because the analysis maintains the total number of releases constant: every groundwater 
release that is avoided still requires remediation as a soil release.

under the Preferred Option, between $110 million and $370 million under Alternative 1, and 
between $32 million and $260 million under Alternative 2. Averted groundwater remediation 
costs, meanwhile, range from $47 million to $160 million under the Preferred Option, $45 
million to $160 million under Alternative 1, and $32 million to $77 million under Alternative 2.  
These alternative estimates represent conservative estimates of the potential value of avoided 
releases, because they do not consider possible factors that may lead to increases in the number 
of releases reported or the number of UST systems in the future.

with relatively lower estimates in one of these categories did not necessarily have similarly low 
estimates in the other, the range of avoided costs presented is not the sum of lower and higher 
bounds in Exhibits 4-10 and 4-11.  As the cumulative release universe in the alternative baseline 
scenario is roughly 60 percent of cumulative releases in the original baseline, total avoided costs 
in the alternative baseline are approximately 40 percent lower than they are in the primary 
analysis.

4.5.5 Avoided Costs by Proposed Requirement 
Exhibit 4-13 presents overall avoided costs by proposed requirement and regulatory 
option. The exhibit shows ranges of the avoided costs for each proposed requirement based on 
experts’ responses to the effects of the individual requirements in the proposed rule. Beneficial 
impacts are concentrated similarly to costs: the majority of avoided costs are captured by 
walkthrough inspections, overfill prevention equipment tests, spill prevention equipment tests, 
interstitial integrity tests, and operability tests.40  Estimates in Exhibit 4-13 assume that cost 
savings associated with each regulatory requirement occur one year after the implementation and 
reflect discounting.  
Under the Preferred Option, total avoided costs are approximately $300 million to $700 
million per year. Avoided costs increase to $300 million to $740 million under Alternative 1, 
largely due to more frequent overfill prevention equipment tests and interstitial integrity tests. 
Avoided costs under Alternative 2 are $110 million to $570 million per year, where less frequent 
walkthrough inspections and no requirement for interstitial integrity tests reduce beneficial 
impacts by approximately 19 percent to 65 percent compared to the Preferred Option.  
We note that the model used by EPA to estimate avoided remediation costs is not 
designed to measure avoided costs from large-scale releases such as those typically associated 
with FCTs and AHFDSs.  We, therefore, do not offer an estimate of avoided costs for 
                                                          
40 Some proposed requirements, particularly those that target narrow subpopulations of the UST system 
universe, may generate higher avoided costs than this analysis suggests.  Three sources of uncertainty drive these 
smaller universe results.  First, EPA's model is calibrated to estimate avoided costs for broad-based national changes 
at average facilities; extrapolation of these results to small populations may not reflect specific subpopulations (e.g., 
UST systems in Indian country).  Second, several experts stated that their estimates of impacts for requirements 
affecting narrow subsets of UST populations are more uncertain than broader estimates.  Finally, experts 
emphasized that equipment replacement, inspection, training, and testing are all essential to ensure release 
reductions, and they used judgment to emphasize the different roles of these different activities.  Therefore, the 
assignment of specific impacts to each of the proposed requirements is potentially less accurate than the aggregate 
estimates of avoided impacts.

a For each proposed requirement, this exhibit presents a range of discounted avoided costs. This range represents the lowest avoided cost 
estimate for the proposed requirement among the four experts and the highest avoided cost estimate for the proposed requirement 
among the four experts. 
b For some requirements, such as removing the deferral for emergency generator tanks, avoided costs under Alternative 2 are higher 
than under the Preferred Option or Alternative 1. This occurs because: 1) these requirements create groundwater contamination 
reductions; and 2) fewer releases are altogether avoided under Alternative 2. This combination of factors implies that groundwater 
reductions have a greater effect under Alternative 2, as they affect a larger number of releases. This effect is very small compared to the 
magnitude of changes in other requirements.

c Some proposed requirements, particularly those that target narrow subpopulations of the UST system universe, may generate higher 
avoided costs than this analysis suggests.  Three sources of uncertainty drive these smaller universe results:  First, EPA's model is

used judgment to emphasize the different roles of these different activities.  Therefore, the assignment of specific impacts to each of the 
proposed requirements is potentially less accurate than the aggregate estimates of avoided impacts. 
d Subtotals and totals presented in this table do not represent the sums of the ranges across the proposed requirements because experts 
with relatively lower estimates for one proposed requirement did not necessarily have similarly low estimates for other requirements.  
Instead, the subtotals and totals shown represent the lowest and highest estimates among the four experts for each subtotal group and for 
the total across all proposed requirements.  
e Experts were not asked to estimate avoided costs resulting from the elimination of groundwater and vapor monitoring. EPA decided to 
include this requirement after consulting with its experts. 
f Reductions in frequency and release severity (as measured by changes in groundwater contamination) do not adequately capture the 
positive impacts of preventing releases from very large systems such as AHFDSs and UST systems with FCTs. Releases from these 
types of systems constitute a small portion of total releases, but may be large in volume and can result in significant groundwater 
impacts. Especially in the case of AHFDSs, even minor problems can create large releases due to the significant pressure under which 
contents are stored. The model used by EPA to estimate avoided remediation costs is not designed to measure avoided costs from very 
large releases such as those typically associated with AHFDSs and FCTs, and we therefore do not offer an estimate of avoided costs for 
requirements that apply to these systems. 
g Experts were not asked to estimate avoided costs resulting from requirements for determining compatibility. EPA decided to include 
this requirement after consulting with its experts. 
h Cost estimates were derived using a seven percent discount rate.    
 
As noted in Exhibit 4-1, EPA excluded the highest state-level remediation cost values from its 
calculation of average cost of release remediation. While this step contributes toward a more 
conservative estimate of avoided costs, the possibility remains that the average remediation costs 
used in Exhibit 4-13 overestimate the positive impacts of the proposed rule if state data provided 
are not representative of national average remediation costs. In Exhibit 4-14, we therefore 
estimate the positive effects of the proposed rule using only the lowest remediation costs 
available.41  As shown in Exhibit 4-14, EPA’s estimate of the avoided costs of the proposed rule 
using the lowest state cost estimates is $190 million to $460 million per year under the Preferred 
Option. This estimate increases to a range of $190 million to $480 million per year under 
Alternative 1 and decreases to a range of $66 million to $370 million per year under Alternative 
2.  While this is not a true “lower bound” estimate, these estimates reflect costs that lead to lower 
than average costs when compared to figures reported by ASTSWMO.42  
                                                          
41 These were provided by the State of New Hampshire’s UST program. 
42 If we calculate a weighted-average cost per release where sources are weighted proportionally by their 
contribution to total releases using the lowest remediation cost data available (i.e., from New Hampshire), we obtain 
an overall average cost per release of approximately $96,000  (See memo in Appendix I for details). For reference, 
ASTSWMO estimates the average cost per site to be roughly $127,000 in 2009. See Association of State and 
Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials, State Fund Survey Results 2009.

a For each proposed requirement, this exhibit presents a range of discounted avoided costs. This range represents the lowest avoided cost 
estimate for the proposed requirement among the four experts and the highest avoided cost estimate for the proposed requirement 
among the four experts. 
b For some requirements, such as removing the deferral for emergency generator tanks, avoided costs under Alternative 2 are higher 
than under the Preferred Option or Alternative 1. This occurs because: 1) these requirements create groundwater contamination 
reductions; and 2) fewer releases are altogether avoided under Alternative 2. This combination of factors implies that groundwater 
reductions have a greater effect under Alternative 2, as they affect a larger number of releases. This effect is very small compared to the 
magnitude of changes in other requirements. 
c Some proposed requirements, particularly those that target narrow subpopulations of the UST system universe, may generate higher 
avoided costs than this analysis suggests.  Three sources of uncertainty drive these smaller universe results:  First, EPA's model is 
calibrated to estimate avoided costs for broad-based national changes at average facilities; extrapolation of these results to small 
populations may not reflect specific subpopulations (e.g., UST systems in Indian country).  Second, several experts stated that their 
estimates of impacts for requirements affecting narrow subsets of UST populations are more uncertain than broader estimates.  Finally, 
experts emphasized that equipment replacement, inspection, training, and testing are all essential to ensure release reductions, and they 
used judgment to emphasize the different roles of these different activities.  Therefore, the assignment of specific impacts to each of the 
proposed requirements is potentially less accurate than the aggregate estimates of avoided impacts. 
d Subtotals and totals presented in this table do not represent the sums of the ranges across the proposed requirements because experts 
with relatively lower estimates for one proposed requirement did not necessarily have similarly low estimates for other requirements.  
Instead, the subtotals and totals shown represent the lowest and highest estimates among the four experts for each subtotal group and for 
the total across all proposed requirements. 
e Experts were not asked to estimate avoided costs resulting from the elimination of groundwater and vapor monitoring. EPA decided to 
include this requirement after consulting with its experts. 
f Reductions in frequency and release severity (as measured by changes in groundwater contamination) do not adequately capture the 
positive impacts of preventing releases from very large systems such as AHFDSs and UST systems with FCTs. Releases from these 
types of systems constitute a small portion of total releases, but may be large in volume and can result in significant groundwater 
impacts. Especially in the case of AHFDSs, even minor problems can create large releases due to the significant pressure under which 
contents are stored. The model used by EPA to estimate avoided remediation costs is not designed to measure avoided costs from very 
large releases such as those typically associated with AHFDSs and FCTs, and we therefore do not offer an estimate of avoided costs for 
requirements that apply to these systems. 
g Experts were not asked to estimate avoided costs resulting from requirements for determining compatibility. EPA decided to include 
this requirement after consulting with its experts. 
h Cost estimates were derived using a seven percent discount rate.    
 
For reference, we also estimate avoided costs using ASTSWMO’s reported average cleanup cost 
of $127,216 for 2009. If we value the releases and groundwater incidents avoided under each 
option using this estimate, we obtain total avoided costs of approximately $250 million to $610 
million under the Preferred Option, $250 million to $640 million under Alternative 1, and $87 
million to $490 million under Alternative 2. Note that these values fall between our primary 
estimates and sensitivity analyses.43 
                                                          
43 Under the alternative baseline, total avoided costs based on New Hampshire remediation costs range 
from $110 million to $280 million in the Preferred Option. This represents an extreme lower bound analysis of 
avoided remediation costs.

4.6 Avoided Vapor Intrusion Damages 
Vapor intrusion generally occurs when petroleum or highly-dissolved concentrations 
come into direct contact with building sumps and foundations, elevator shafts, and preferential 
pathways (e.g. improperly sealed utility lines). Intrusion can also occur when these substances 
come close to building foundations.44 The cost to remediate vapor intrusion is typically 
incremental to the cost to remediate a LUST site. Based on information provided by four states, 
EPA estimates that from one to 10 percent of all releases cause vapor intrusion issues. Each of 
these instances requires additional remedial actions valued between $27,000 and $52,000 beyond 
ordinary release remediation costs.45 As reported in Exhibit 4-15, given 1,680 to 5,370 avoided 
releases and mitigated groundwater incidents, we estimate between 17 and 540 avoided vapor 
intrusion incidents under the Preferred Option. This reduction would avoid between $0.4 million 
and $26 million per year in avoided remediation costs related to vapor intrusion. While the lower 
end of this range does not vary significantly among the options, EPA estimates savings of up to 
$28 million under Alternative 1 and $19 million under Alternative 2.

 Under the alternative baseline, avoided vapor intrusion costs fall due to the smaller 
universe of releases. In the Preferred Option, avoided costs are $0.3 million to $16.0 million. 
Under Alternative 1, avoided costs range from $0.3 million to $17 million; under Alternative 2, 
they range between $0.1 million and $11.0 million. See Exhibit 4-20 for a full accounting of 
avoided costs in the alternative baseline.

associated with avoided releases by multiplying the average volume associated with each release 
source by the number of releases of that type before and after the proposed rule is in effect. 
Based on the estimates of avoided releases presented by the experts, the draft 23-state Autopsy 
Report’s distribution of releases, and average release volumes reported in the Florida study, EPA 
estimates that approximately 0.64 million gallons to 2.3 million gallons per year of diesel and 
gasoline releases are avoided as a consequence of the Preferred Option. At an average price of 
$3.27 per gallon, owners and operators avoid losing approximately $2.0 million to $7.2 million 
in product due to releases.46 These values increase to a range of 0.84 million gallons to 2.5 
million gallons and $2.6 million to $7.6 million under Alternative 1 and decrease to a range of 
0.13 million gallons to 1.7 million gallons and $0.4 million to $5.3 million under Alternative 2.  
Limited data on release size do not support an analysis of avoided product loss associated with 
releases that are reduced in severity.

Statistics 2010 (at http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/pdf/entire.pdf).  We weight 
these prices according to prime supplier sales volumes in 2009 published by the Energy Information 
Administration, which summed to 362,798.5 thousands of gallons per day for gasoline and 132,489.3 thousands of 
gallons per day for all grades of diesel fuel (at http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_prim_dcu_nus_a.htm). 
 
Under the alternative baseline, avoided costs due to product loss are lower than in the 
original baseline as there are relatively fewer releases. In the Preferred Option, avoided costs due 
to product loss are $1.2 million to $4.3 million. Under Alternative 1, avoided costs range from 
$1.6 million to $4.6 million; under Alternative 2, they range between $0.2 million and $3.2 
million. See Exhibit 4-20 for a full accounting of avoided costs in the alternative baseline 
scenario.

4.8 Human Health Benefits 
Exposure to petroleum through ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation can cause a 
range of health effects, including cancer and non-cancer impacts associated with benzene, and 
non-cancer impacts (e.g., neurological impacts) associated with other petroleum constituents 
such as toluene.47  Reductions in the number and severity of releases will reduce these exposures 
and associated morbidity and mortality impacts.  This benefits assessment examines the impacts 
of the regulations under consideration on population cancer risks associated with benzene 
exposures through groundwater.   Other health impacts, including benzene-related risks through 
inhalation of vapor and nonbenzene health effects, are not able to be reliably quantified with 
available data, but represent additional potential benefits of the rule. 
4.8.1 Avoided Benzene Cancer Risk 
To address human health benefits associated with avoided exposure to benzene through 
groundwater, EPA performed a screening analysis using data on:  
• Expected number of cancer cases per underground storage tank release; 
• Estimated number of releases prevented through implementation of the regulatory 
revisions; and, 
• Estimated WTP to avoid a fatal cancer, expressed as the value of a statistical life 
(VSL).  
The EPA risk assessment provides population risk estimates on a per-release basis, 
expressed as the expected number of cancer cases per release. That analysis estimated population 
risk for releases of varying volumes and plume ages.48 To estimate the benefits of avoided cancer 
cases, EPA uses the estimated number of releases avoided and releases reduced in severity and 
applies the 2009 EPA estimated value of a statistical life (VSL) of $8.9 million as the value 
associated with avoiding one terminal cancer.49,50   
Exhibit 4-17 presents EPA’s findings for four avoided release scenarios. The analysis 
shows that, even under unlikely assumptions of 100-year plumes and 5,000 gallon releases, total 
upper bound human health benefits due to avoided cancer cases are limited to approximately

health effects that occur many years after exposure.

$850,000 per year under the Preferred Option. This value changes little when considering 
Alternatives 1 or 2.  EPA’s central estimate of the benefits associated with avoided cancer 
incidence uses avoided costs from scenarios in which plume ages are one and five years and 
average release volume is 50 gallons, consistent with release data from available studies.51 These 
assumptions suggest human health benefits of approximately $1,400 to $4,500 per year 
associated with avoided benzene-related cancer risk.   
These modest findings reflect a number of assumptions that may provide an incomplete picture 
of the risks associated with leaks from underground storage tanks.  First, they reflect the 
frequency of confirmed releases, and (except in the 100-year spill time frame) the assumption 
that the existing UST cleanup program eliminates all exposure immediately upon release 
discovery.  In addition, the risk assessment did not consider larger-scale releases over 5,000 
gallons in any scenario, though a number of these are reported annually.  Finally, exposure 
scenarios generally reflect behavioral assumptions that exposed individuals will limit their own 
exposure in certain cases (e.g., when petroleum contamination exceeds a “taste/odor threshold” 
and water is no longer palatable).  Any or all of these assumptions may not hold in all cases, and 
other risks and health benefits are not reflected at all in this screening level risk assessment (see 
below).  However, it is also not unreasonable to assume that health impacts under this proposed 
rule would be limited, given the baseline existence of technical and cleanup requirements 
designed to minimize human exposure.     
                                                          
51 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Underground Storage Tanks, “Petroleum Releases at 
Underground Storage Tank Facilities in Florida,” draft, March 2005.  Note that this estimate differs from the 
calculated avoided product loss based on average release volumes in the Florida autopsy data.  We use a more 
conservative estimate of release volumes (consistent with median release volumes from Florida’s autopsy study) to 
reflect uncertainty regarding exposure and to offset the risk analysis assumption that releases occur over a very short 
time frame.

Under the alternative baseline, the total upper bound human health benefits due to 
avoided cancer cases are limited to approximately $510,000 per year under the Preferred Option. 
The central estimate of the benefits associated with avoided cancer incidence suggests human 
health benefits of approximately $840 to $2,700 per year associated with avoided benzene-
related cancer risk. See Exhibit 4-20 for a full accounting of avoided costs in the alternative 
baseline scenario.  
4.8.2 Other Human Health Benefits 
The foregoing benefits from avoided benzene cancer avoidance represent only one 
portion of the health risk associated with releases from leaking UST systems.  The risk 
assessment examined only benzene risks through groundwater ingestion and shower inhalation 
and focused on average population risks. Such risks are limited in part because the analysis 
concluded that many sites do not have residents using groundwater near the area affected by a 
plume.  Nevertheless, the risk assessment concluded that some larger releases may have 
significant human health risks associated with them.     
 
Inhalation risks associated with direct exposure to vapor and other petroleum-related 
chemicals were not evaluated.52  While EPA does not expect most instances of these risks to be 
                                                          
52 Neither cancer nor non-cancer risks of these types were evaluated. 
 
 
 
 
4-30 
large, significant risks remain for a subset of releases.  To the extent that the proposed rule would 
prevent or mitigate the most significant releases, this analysis may understate the avoided human 
health impacts associated with the rule.    
More broadly, the complex nature of petroleum mixtures and the limited toxicological 
data available both for petroleum mixtures and for individual component compounds of 
petroleum limits EPA’s ability to comprehensively document the health effects associated with 
the most significant releases.  However, the toxicological testing that has been conducted on 
some common components of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) suggests that exposures to 
TPH through inhalation or ingestion could result in the following effects: 
• Neurological effects, such as central nervous system depression, have been 
associated with acute and chronic exposures to toluene and xylenes; n-hexane 
exposure has been associated with effects on peripheral neuropathy; 
• Hematological effects associated with oral and inhalation exposure to benzene 
and with oral and inhalation exposure to naphthalene; 
• Renal and hepatic effects associated with BTEX compounds and other aromatic 
hydrocarbon compounds; 
• Developmental effects associated with intermediate exposures to ethylbenzene 
and xylenes; and  
• Carcinogenic effects of oral exposures to certain polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) including benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, and 
dibenz(a,h)anthracene.53 
Reduced exposure to TPH as a result of the proposed rule could therefore have nonquantified 
benefits related to reducing the risks of one or more of the above health effects. 
4.9 Avoided Acute Exposure Events and Large-Scale Releases 
Most health effects associated with leaking underground storage tanks reflect long-term 
exposures, but some releases from UST systems relate to acute events such as fire or explosion.  
These releases can involve acute exposures, large volumes of free product, extensive ecological 
damage, and injuries and death, depending on the circumstances of the event.  Because these 
events are difficult to predict and infrequent, it is not possible to quantify or monetize the impact 
associated with avoiding them, but the response, remediation, and medical costs associated with 
a single acute incident could be significant.  The proposed regulations are designed to ensure 
effective maintenance of UST systems, and one benefit will be to reduce the chances of an acute 
event that could result in a large-scale release and its associated damages (e.g., a well-maintained 
UST system is less likely to be in a condition where it may explode).

4-31 
Acute events are especially important in the case of UST systems such as airport hydrant 
fuel distribution systems and UST systems with field-constructed tanks, which can hold large 
volumes of fuel. Releases from these systems can be large in volume and can result in significant 
groundwater and other environmental and health impacts.  For instance, an estimated 300,000 to 
500,000 gallons of fuel was released from a 2.1 million gallon underground field-constructed 
tank at a fuel depot in Portsmouth, VA that was in operation from the 1950s to mid-1980s.  Free 
product was found within 20 feet of a nearby creek in 1987.  To date, approximately 143,000 
gallons of product have been recovered.54   
Another example of the potential magnitude of the releases from these systems is Pease 
Air Force Base, where jet fuel was delivered to the runway apron via an underground fueling 
system.55   Historical leakage from the system contaminated soil and groundwater, forming 
groundwater plumes at many sites along the system.56 A site release study identified 60 to 70 
release points with varying degrees of severity along the refueling system line with free product 
found under the apron at closure.57  While there are no historical records available indicating the 
amount of leaked fuel or leak origins, the presence of residual soil and groundwater 
contamination poses a significant threat to human health and the environment.  
While the analytical procedure used by EPA to estimate benefits was unable to capture 
the positive impacts of preventing releases from these types of systems, we note that preventing 
or mitigating these releases may generate substantial reductions in remediation costs.  
4.10 Ecological Benefits 
 
 A document prepared for EPA outlines the types of ecological damages that can result 
from land-based pollution releases:58 
  
Measurable damage to ecological resources from land releases generally occurs when groundwater 
or overland flow of water carry contaminants to a nearby surface water body. Flood events and 
other acute incidents can cause releases of waste that have an immediate and significant effect on

ecological resources (e.g., a surface impoundment dike fails and releases contaminants into a river, 
killing fish and other biota). More common are gradual increases in contaminant levels due to 
long-term releases to groundwater. These may have a broad array of impacts on both resources 
used by humans (such as fish populations) and on “non-use value” such as the value of preserving 
habitat and species diversity. In addition, biota can be affected by uptake of contaminants from 
soil, particularly in wetlands or areas where the water table is high. 
 
Because of their locations, releases from underground storage tanks would likely be classified as 
land releases. Thus, any releases avoided due to the proposed rule may result in ecological 
benefits.   A complete assessment of ecological benefits, however, requires significant location-
specific data, and it is often difficult to identify sufficient data to support valuation of both use 
and non-use values of preserving habitat and species diversity.   
 
The ecological benefits that accrue from the proposed rule are likely to occur as a 
consequence of averted groundwater contamination.  The resource economics literature contains 
numerous examples of studies that value these services, as demonstrated by the public’s WTP for 
groundwater protection programs (e.g., see Poe et al. 2001).59  However, these values are largely 
context-specific in terms of location, scale, and the specific threat to groundwater considered and 
do not provide broadly-applicable information on the value of groundwater.   
Some attempts have been made to develop standardized values for groundwater, often for 
purposes of Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA).60  For instance, the State of New 
Jersey currently employs a replacement cost approach to determine interim economic losses 
associated with injuries to groundwater.61 Even so, replacement cost methods do not constitute a 
proper WTP valuation.  The replacement cost of natural resources and their services capture 
WTP only when they meet three criteria:  1) replacement provides equivalent quality and 
quantity of services; 2) the public is actually willing to pay for the replacement; and 3) 
replacement is the most cost-effective means of restoring the lost services.62  Even if these 
conditions are true, this approach may overestimate groundwater values in urban areas, as land is 
typically more expensive, and underestimate groundwater values in areas where land is less 
expensive.

60 Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) is the process of estimating the monetary cost of 
restoring natural resources injured by discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances.  Monetary costs, or 
damages, are estimated by identifying the services provided by the injured natural resources, determining the 
baseline level of the services provided by the resources, and quantifying the reduction in services that result from 
the natural resource injury.  U.S. EPA. Natural Resource Damage Assessment. www.epa.gov/ superfund/ 
programs/nrd/nrda2.htm. 
61 New Jersey’s approach follows three steps. First, the approach determines the total present value of 
potential yield from the contaminated area over the relevant period of impairment, typically based on a site-specific 
or regional recharge rate for the area in question.  Second, again considering regional recharge rates, it estimates the 
amount of land required to protect an equivalent present value total volume of groundwater.  Finally, the approach 
identifies and appraises candidate parcels.  The cost of acquiring such a parcel for purposes of protecting a volume 
of groundwater equivalent to what was lost represents the measure of damages.

Because an assessment of the value of groundwater protected by the proposed rule is 
affected by spatial heterogeneity, it requires information about the public’s WTP for protection 
in all states and territories.  These data are not available, and EPA is therefore unable to place a 
value on the groundwater protected. Instead, we provide an estimate below of the total quantity 
of groundwater that may be protected by the rule.  We note, though, that a portion of the value of 
restoring groundwater is captured as part of the cost to remediate each release discussed earlier 
in this chapter.  However, while the cost of restoring groundwater to a higher quality after 
contamination is captured as part of the cost to remediate each release, it cannot be assumed that 
remediation captures WTP.  In many cases, performing remediation to “safe” levels does not 
fully eliminate contamination, and therefore does not restore the resource to its original value.  
Therefore, while a significant portion of the value of the quantity of groundwater protected may 
be captured by the avoided remediation costs, it may not reflect the full WTP of groundwater 
protection.   
Exhibit 4-18 summarizes a screening assessment of the volume of groundwater 
contamination potentially avoided because of reductions in releases and groundwater 
contamination incidents. The analysis relies on the EPA risk assessment, which describes typical 
volumes of groundwater affected by releases of different sizes over various discovery time 
frames.63 EPA’s analysis estimates that 40 billion gallons to 130 billion gallons of groundwater 
per year are protected under conservative assumptions of 10 gallon release volumes that migrate 
for only one year before discovery. Under the upper bound conditions of 5,000 gallon release 
volumes and 100 year lifetimes, up to 5.7 trillion gallons of groundwater per year would be 
potentially protected by the regulatory changes.64 We also calculate the impact of 50 gallon 
releases over one- and five-year time frames.  These releases appear most consistent with 
empirical data in the draft 23-state Autopsy Report.  Assuming that 50 gallon releases and one- 
to five-year time frames represent the average parameters of avoided releases, we estimate that 
approximately 110 to 350 billion gallons of groundwater  would be protected annually from 
LUST-related releases due to the potential regulatory changes.65 
                                                          
63 “Risk Analysis to Support Potential Revisions to Underground Storage Tank (UST) Regulations,” 
prepared by RTI International, December 22, 2010. 
64 The risk assessment on which this analysis is based did not estimate groundwater contamination volumes 
outside of a one-mile radius about the point of release. The assessment notes that groundwater may be contaminated 
outside that radius, but it does not estimate this quantity. Generally, only releases greater than 1,000 gallons are 
affected by this phenomenon, i.e., groundwater contamination is likely underestimated for the 5,000 gallon, 100-
year release scenario. 
65 The release volume data used in the groundwater protection assessment differs from the data used to 
calculate product loss and may lead to apparent inconsistencies. For instance, under the Preferred Option, prevention 
of 1.2 million gallons of product loss over 2,200 releases implies an average of over 500 gallons per release; 
however, in the groundwater protection analysis, EPA relies on estimates of groundwater contaminated based on 
releases of 50 gallons for the following two reasons:  (1) the volumes of product loss based on Florida data are based 
on actual data, while the risk analysis relies on a simulation; and (2) the simulation assumes that product is released 
over a relatively short period of time (approximately one month), which likely overstates the effect of groundwater 
contamination for any given volume. Given these circumstances, EPA selected an average release volume to 
characterize groundwater contamination that is significantly lower than the volume implied by the analysis of 
product loss, but which reduces the risk of overstating positive impacts from groundwater protection.

Under the alternative baseline, assuming that 50 gallon releases and one- to five-year 
time frames represent the average parameters of avoided releases, approximately 65 to 210 
billion gallons of groundwater  would be protected annually in the Preferred Option. See Exhibit 
4-20 for a full accounting of avoided costs in the alternative baseline.  
4.11 Conclusion 
 Exhibit 4-19 summarizes the monetized avoided costs and benefits due to the proposed 
rule. In total, EPA estimates approximately $300 million to $740 million in costs will be avoided 
as a consequence of the Preferred Option. In addition, the proposed rule will generate modest 
benefits due to avoided cancer risks. Although their value cannot be reliably monetized, roughly 
110 billion to 350 billion gallons of groundwater per year will avoid contamination due to new 
requirements. Finally, the proposed rule will generate ecological benefits and reductions in 
nonbenzene morbidity and mortality risks that we could not quantify in our analysis.

Approximately 65 billion to 210 billion gallons of groundwater per year will avoid 
contamination due to the proposed requirements in the Preferred Option. Overall, positive 
impacts under the alternative baseline are roughly 60 percent of positive impacts when the 
original baseline is assumed.

Chapter 5.  Distributional Impacts and Considerations  
 
5.1  Introduction 
This chapter considers specific impacts that may be created by the distribution of the 
costs and benefits of the proposed rule.  EPA has undertaken several analyses to examine how 
the pattern of costs and benefits may affect specific populations and sectors of the economy.  
Specifically, the chapter considers: 
 
• Economic impacts associated with the costs of the proposed rule:  These could 
include changes in facility operation and closure of facilities due to cost increases 
under the regulation.  In addition, the proposed rule may create negative and 
positive employment impacts, including both reductions in employment to reduce 
costs and increases in employment to ensure implementation of rule provisions.  
Finally, the proposed rule may affect public spending related to cleanup of 
contaminated sites. 
 
• Energy impacts associated with the proposed rule:  EPA considers the potential 
for this proposed rule to affect the supply, distribution, or use of energy, including 
changes in the price of fuel. 
 
• Impacts on small business and governments: EPA’s regulatory flexibility analysis 
considers the potential for rule-related costs to have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities (SISNOSE). 
 
• Impacts on minority and low-income populations:  EPA considers the potential 
for the proposed rule to have disproportionate impacts on minority or low-income 
populations. 
 
• Children’s health impacts:  EPA considers the potential for the proposed rule to 
have a significant or disproportionate impact on the health of children. 
 
Note that the analyses in this chapter employ data and results from EPA’s primary analysis 
assuming a constant number of tanks and releases over 20 years.  This chapter does not consider 
impacts under the alternative baseline scenarios. In general, impacts under alternative baseline 
assumptions would be slightly smaller, reflecting the smaller universe of affected facilities over 
time.  
5.2  Economic Impacts 
In the context of regulatory analysis, an economic impact is an effect on the economic 
wellbeing, or welfare, of any stakeholder due to compliance with the proposed rule.  Direct 
economic impacts can be borne by producers (i.e., those who produce, distribute, or sell products 
  5-2 
associated with the proposed rule), by consumers (i.e., those who purchase products associated 
with the proposed rule), or both.   
The economic impacts of the proposed rule result from increases in compliance costs due 
to new regulation.  In the short run, producers (i.e., owners or operators of facilities with UST 
systems) can respond to cost increases in one of two ways: by passing through some or all costs 
to customers (consumers) through increases in price, or by absorbing costs and reducing 
profitability.  If producers cannot pass on to consumers any of their increased compliance costs, 
the proposed rule will chiefly affect producers in the short run, and economic impacts may 
include reduced profits, changes in operation, and in extreme cases, facility closure. If producers 
are able to increase prices on products to recover some or all compliance costs, the proposed rule 
will affect consumers by raising prices.  The extent to which producers can pass through costs 
depends on the structure of the markets in which they operate.  
As we discuss in subsequent sections, we do not believe that many firms will be able to 
pass increases in prices on to consumers through higher fuel prices. While local level motor fuel 
retail stations may face similar increases in costs of compliance, consumers’ sensitivity to 
changes in gasoline prices provides a significant disincentive for station operators to increase 
fuel prices.1 Instead, compliance costs are likely to be passed on through cross-marketed goods 
whose demand is less sensitive to changes in prices, such as items for sale at gas station 
convenience stores. 
EPA’s assessment of the economic impacts associated with this rule is presented as 
follows: 
• Distribution of affected facilities. We first discuss the universe of affected 
facilities, with a focus on the retail motor fuels sector.  This section also describes 
supply and demand dynamics within the retail motor fuels market and the likely 
economic responses to increased compliance costs.  
• Screening level economic impact analysis of average costs on facilities.  EPA 
presents a screening assessment of the impacts of average estimated facility-level 
costs on the facilities affected by the rule. 
• Sensitivity analysis of economic impacts.  To address uncertainty related to the 
distribution of costs among UST facilities, we present a “worst case” sensitivity 
analysis that identifies the maximum number of facilities that could face 
significant economic impacts due to regulatory costs.  This section also briefly 
discusses implications for facility closures and changes in employment. 
                                                          
1 A high degree of consumer sensitivity to changes in gasoline prices does not imply that prices are equal 
across gasoline stations in the same area. Factors that affect retail motor fuel prices at the station-level include traffic 
flows, population density, and intensity of local retail competition on the demand side, while supply can be affected 
by land cost, station setup, labor costs, and taxes. See p. 15 – 16, Fischer, Jeffrey. “The Economics of Price Zones 
and Territorial Restrictions in Gasoline Marketing,” 2004, Federal Trade Commission, accessed at 
http://www.ftc.gov/be/workpapers/wp271.pdf  
  5-3 
• Impacts on public funding for cleanups.  The proposed rule is estimated to 
result in significant cost savings associated with avoided cleanup requirements as 
releases decline.  A significant portion of cleanup costs are currently borne by the 
public sector, using taxes and fees to fund state cleanup efforts.  EPA examines 
the potential reduction in public sector liabilities associated with the broader 
reduction in releases. 
5.2.1 Distribution of UST Systems by Industry Sector 
As shown in Exhibit 2-3 in Chapter 2, the majority of UST systems are located at motor 
fuel retailers (i.e., gas stations).  EPA estimates that, of the 611,449 UST systems active in 2009, 
481,108 (roughly 80 percent) were located at approximately 162,000 motor fuel locations in the 
United States.2 The remaining 130,341 (roughly 20 percent) of facilities are spread across 
several industries, including the commercial sector (wholesale, retail, accommodation, and food 
services), manufacturing, transportation, communications and utilities, and hospitals.3  Notably, 
the sectors other than retail motor fuels are difficult to characterize with regard to UST systems; 
depending on their uses, UST systems may occur in varying numbers at facilities of varying size 
and purpose across all sectors.  Only in the retail motor fuel sector do UST systems serve a 
similar, central function at virtually all facilities in the sector.  
In addition to comprising 80 percent of all UST systems, establishments in the retail 
motor fuels sector also have the highest average number of UST systems per facility, with a 
facility average of 2.97 (roughly three systems per facility). In comparison, facilities in other 
sectors have, on average, between 1.47 and 2.30 systems.4 Because many requirements in the 
proposed rule occur at the UST system level, establishments in the retail motor fuels sector have 
the highest average compliance costs per facility. In total, this sector is likely to bear roughly 70 
percent of total costs associated with the proposed rule.5 
Because the costs of the proposed rule will primarily affect the retail motor fuels sector, 
and because this sector is characterized by a large number of independently-owned facilities and 
companies, this economic impact analysis focuses on the retail motor fuels sector.  
                                                          
2 EPA’s count of UST systems includes states and territories, while the estimate of retail motor fuel 
locations includes only facilities in the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Alaska.  Because only 7,619 UST systems 
(approximately 1.1 percent) are located in other U.S territories, we use 162,000 facilities as the total population. 
3 See Chapter 2.1 for more detail. 
4 See Exhibit 2-3. For example, we calculate 2.30 systems per commercial facility by dividing 52,271 
systems by 22,730 facilities. 
5 Total costs under the Preferred Option are $210 million, with $180 million directly related to conventional 
USTs and EGTs.  Motor fuel retailers will bear approximately 80 percent of these $180 million in costs, which 
represent roughly 70 percent of total costs under the Preferred Option.  
  5-4 
5.2.2 Market Dynamics in the Retail Motor Fuels Sector 
This section provides an overview of the U.S. wholesale and retail motor fuels markets, 
including market concentration, fuel distribution practices, and the implications of market 
structure for pricing.  
Supply-side Characteristics: Ability of Producers to Pass Through Costs 
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for retail motor fuel 
sales (i.e., gasoline stations) is 447, and specifically applies to retailers of automotive fuel and 
automotive oils.  Establishments classified under NAICS code 447 include facilities with and 
without convenience stores, and all have specialized equipment for the storing and dispensing of 
automotive fuels.6 
According to the 2002 Economic Census, average revenues for establishments in NAICS 
sector 447 were approximately $2.1 million. On average, each establishment employed 
approximately eight employees.7  
Market Concentration 
Market concentration is an indicator of the ability of firms to raise prices in response to 
changes in the costs of doing business: in markets with fewer, larger companies (i.e., highly 
concentrated markets), large firms typically have greater ability to pass through price increases to 
consumers. One indicator of market concentration is the proportion of total sales made by 
individual firms within a particular market. In markets where concentration is high, few firms 
earn a relatively large proportion of the total revenues in a market and are sometimes able to pass 
price increases through to consumers because of limited competition from smaller firms.  
The retail motor fuels sector is representative of the broader retail sector in market 
concentration.  Specifically, one-third of all sales made by NAICS sector 447 are made by 
establishments owned by the fifty largest firms in the sector, compared with 32 percent of sales 
to the largest 50 firms in the broader retail sector.8  This level of market concentration does not 
suggest that retailers will easily pass through price increases.9

2004. Accessed online at: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/concentration.html 
7 While EPA relies on 2002 Economic Census figures for values per facility, this analysis relies on more 
recent and focused National Petroleum News Survey values for a count of the number of facilities. 
8 2002 Economic Census, Retail Trade, Industry series. Gasoline Stations: 2002. Issued November 14, 
2004. Accessed online at: http://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0244i14.pdf 
9 A common measure of market concentration can be obtained through the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index 
(“HHI”), which is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market and then summing 
the resulting numbers. For example, if only two firms operate in a market and each has 50 percent of sales, then the 
index would register 502 + 502 = 5,000. The U.S. Department of Justice’s merger guidelines categorize markets in 
which HHI is between 1,000 and 1,800 points as moderately concentrated, and those in which the HHI is in excess 
of 1,800 points as concentrated. Because the four largest firms in NAICS sector 447 generate only eight percent of 
  5-5 
Geographical Concentration 
Gasoline stations are generally distributed across the United States in proportion to 
population. The most populous states have more establishments and higher proportions of 
gasoline sales.10 While no data are available regarding the distribution of facilities by size, the 
retail gasoline market is relatively homogeneous nationwide, and it is likely that facilities of 
different sizes are distributed according to population as well. 
Ownership Structure 
The 2009 Gas Price Kit published by the National Association of Convenience Stores 
classifies motor fuel retailers into three broad categories, depending on the manner in which they 
obtain their wholesale product:11 
• Refinery-Owned:  Fewer than two percent of facilities are retail operations 
directly owned by large oil producers. These stations receive wholesale product 
directly from the oil company’s refinery, and their profit is part of the oil 
company’s profit. At these facilities, the parent corporation manages all aspects of 
the customer experience and establishes a consistent brand identity.  
• Branded Independent Retailers:  Approximately 55 percent of facilities are 
branded independent retailers.  These facilities are owned by independent 
operators and contract with a refinery to sell a particular brand of gasoline. This 
owner leverages the supplier’s marketing and ensures constant supply in exchange 
for a surcharge per gallon paid to the supplier. Branded retailers’ contracts with 
refiners typically contain clauses that specify the margins retailers can charge 
above wholesale prices. 
• Unbranded Independent Retailers:  Approximately 45 percent of facilities are 
unbranded independent retailers. These retailers purchase gasoline on the open 
market, without committing to a particular supplier. 
Wholesale gasoline is a commodity, but varies in price regionally based on a combination 
of refinery locations, specific fuel mixes (e.g., to meet air quality standards), and the type of 
distributors in a region. Types of wholesalers include:12  
                                                                                                                                                                                           
the sales in that market, the HHI will be well below 1,000 for this sector. We conclude that firms’ relatively small 
market share translates into weak pricing power. For additional information, see: http://www.justice.gov/

• Refinery-owned wholesalers: Refiners (typically large oil companies) distribute 
directly to their own retail outlets in all regions, and in some areas may also 
distribute directly to independent branded and unbranded retailers (competing 
with other suppliers in the unbranded market). 
• Area Franchisees: Otherwise known as “jobbers,” these firms obtain the right 
from oil companies to franchise a brand of motor fuel in a particular area.  Jobbers 
are responsible for siting and building new facilities and marketing the brand, 
which further removes refiners from operating activities. The term is also used to 
describe wholesale distributors of motor fuels that offer multiple brands.  
While some regions have significant competition among distributors, the market power of 
refiners and the contract structure of many retailers means that retailers in general have little 
control over the price of their fuel supply.13 As a consequence, any cost increases must be 
absorbed by retailers or passed through to customers. 
Demand-side Characteristics: Consumer Response to Price Increases 
Consumer reactions to price changes are critical in determining whether a producer (i.e., 
retailer) can pass on costs. The degree to which consumers change the quantity they consume 
when the price of a good increases is known as the price elasticity of demand. Economists define 
demand as inelastic if the quantity demanded changes less than price (e.g., quantity demanded 
changes by one percent when prices rise (or fall) by 1.4 percent). Similarly, demand is said to be 
elastic if quantity demanded changes proportionally more for a relative change in price. 
Motor fuel retailers rely on sales of gasoline for most revenues, though most also sell 
other automobile-related or convenience products. Research has documented that broad 
(national) market demand for gasoline is relatively price-inelastic in the short-run: consumers do 
not make immediate, significant changes in gasoline purchases if prices increase.14    On its face, 
this dynamic would suggest that a retailer could pass through any cost increases to consumers. 
However, the structure of the market for gasoline prohibits significant price fluctuations at the 
facility level. While national demand is relatively consistent, consumers are highly sensitive to 
price differences within local markets.15  Small increases in price at one location can produce 
relatively large changes in quantity demanded for a particular facility as consumers seek other 
local retailers with lower costs.   
                                                          
13 Other suppliers, e.g. for convenience store items, may be easier with which to negotiate but may not be 
available to all motor fuel retailers.

Economics, July: p. 203 – 210. 
15 As noted above, a high degree of consumer sensitivity to changes in gasoline prices does not imply that 
prices are equal across gasoline stations in the same area. See:  Fischer, Jeffrey. “The Economics of Price Zones and 
Territorial Restrictions in Gasoline Marketing,” 2004, Federal Trade Commission, accessed at 
http://www.ftc.gov/be/workpapers/wp271.pdf

A recent National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) survey provides insights 
into the price pressures faced by local retailers:16 
• 73 percent of respondents stated that price was the most important factor in their 
gasoline-purchasing choices. 
• 32 percent stated that they would take the time to make a left turn on a busy street 
to save a penny per gallon of gasoline. 
• 20 percent said they would drive ten minutes out of their way (a 20-minute round 
trip plus cost of fuel) to save two cents per gallon. This amounts to savings of less 
than one dollar in terms of fuel for nearly all passenger vehicles on the road today. 
Local competition for price-sensitive customers discourages retailers from increasing 
gasoline prices, except in cases such as wholesale price increases or tax increases where changes 
are uniform across facilities.17  Because compliance costs may vary by facility depending on 
existing technology and practice, it is not likely that retailers will opt to pass through compliance 
costs by raising gasoline prices.  While retailers may be able to increase the prices of other 
products (e.g., motor oil or convenience store products), it is also likely that some retailers will 
be forced to absorb some or all of the costs associated with the regulation.  
Retailers in relative isolation may be better positioned to pass on increases in cost to 
consumers. Research shows that store-level pricing is sensitive to the concentration of 
competition. In areas where motor fuel retailers are relatively sparse, facilities may be better able 
to pass cost increases on to consumers, for whom the opportunity cost of finding an alternative 
store is higher when they must travel farther.18 
However, because consumers are especially price sensitive about gasoline and it is not 
clear what other options owners or operators have to increase prices, we assume that owners or 
operators will likely bear the economic impacts of the rule.  We therefore examine producer 
impacts, including the possibility that some facilities may close due to cost increases.19

“Testimony of Bill Douglass, Douglass Distributing Company, on behalf of The National Association of 
Convenience Stores before the House Judiciary Committee, Anti-Trust Task Force Hearing to Examine the 
Consumer Effects of Rising Gas Prices,” May 7, 2008. 
17 This may vary, depending on the region. For example, in Vancouver, gasoline prices are uniform and 
rigid (due to tacit collusion among wholesalers), while prices in Ottawa are dispersed and volatile (due to the price-
disrupting behavior of “maverick” firms). See Eckert, Andrew and Douglas S. West, “A tale of two cities: Price 
uniformity and price volatility in gasoline retailing, “2003, The Annals of Regional Science 38:25–46.

19 A more detailed analysis of consumer impacts is prohibitively difficult for two reasons. First, the precise 
set of goods and services whose prices may increase is difficult to characterize. Second, gasoline aside, the main 
draw to products sold at retail motor fuel facilities is convenience, i.e., ease of access.  Most non-fuel products can 
be purchased for lower prices at grocery stores, for example. Consumers can therefore shop at other types of

5.2.3 Assessment of Market Exits and Employment Impacts 
In a market setting where producers cannot reliably pass through costs, the most 
significant economic impacts are related to reduced facility profits.  In some cases, managers can 
cut supply or employment costs (this could result in smaller worker paychecks).  In cases where 
costs exceed facility profits, it is likely that in the long term a facility would exit the market.  A 
critical factor, therefore, is an estimate of average firm or facility profits.     
It is difficult to estimate the profitability of retail motor fuel stations because many are 
small and privately held and are not required to report profits publicly.  However, some evidence 
suggests that profit margins are below five percent, and data suggest that average after-tax profit 
margins reported to the IRS for gas stations are roughly 1.5 percent.20  Holding all other things 
equal, an annual cost greater than 1.5 percent of gross sales (i.e., a cost greater than $1,500 for a 
firm earning $100,000 a year) would exceed average reported profits and would therefore cause 
a motor fuel retailer to operate at a loss.  If the facility cannot adjust its prices or lower costs, it 
will eventually exit the market.21   
Consistent with the assessment of small business impacts in Section 5.4 of this chapter, 
EPA considers the impact of the proposed rule on small facilities in order to identify the most 
likely facilities to exit the market.  Assuming that all motor retail facilities, regardless of income, 
have an “average” configuration of approximately three tanks, EPA calculates the average total 
cost per facility to be $892 under the Preferred Option (reflecting a cost of approximately $300 
per UST system).22,23   
Using data from the 2002 Economic Census and the regulatory flexibility screening 
analysis methodology, EPA concludes that a facility-level cost of $892 would exceed 1.5 percent 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
facilities for the same goods, but typically opt to pay a premium for purchases at a convenient location. Note that, 
even though consumers will be able to purchase equivalent goods at different locations, there is a reduction in 
consumer surplus associated with the loss of convenience in the purchase. 
20 For corporations reporting net income, profit margins before non-cash items (depreciation and 
amortization) and income tax (or credits) were approximately 1.8 percent. Earnings before depreciation and 
amortization account for the fact that firms can postpone capital expenditures to save cash, and would likely do so 
while adapting to higher costs.   If non-cash items and taxes are included, earnings drop to roughly one percent.  Our 
approach averages of the two options, reflecting an assumption that firms will do something to adapt to higher costs 
while they sort out how to adjust prices, and that firms typically minimize profits reported to the IRS.    See SOI 
TaxStats, Table 7: Corporation Returns with Net Income for 2007, accessed at 
http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=170693,00.html. See also 2002 - 2010 RMA Statement Studies, Sector 447, 
for a range of profitability data from facilities of different sizes. 
21 Throughout this chapter, EPA refers interchangeably to reductions in net profit and the proportion of 
revenues that the costs of the proposed rule will create. In both cases, we refer to the impact of the cost of the 
proposed rule on the profitability of a facility.  
22 Specifically, we assume 2.97 UST systems per facility. 
23 Under Alternative 1 the average retail motor fuel facility cost would be $1,801, and under Alternative 2 it 
would be $613.  In Indian country, where facilities are required to meet more requirements than elsewhere; average 
cost per facility is $2,364 under the Preferred Option, $3,333 under Alternative 1, and $1,999 under Alternative 2. 
  5-9 
of total reported revenues (i.e., be equal to or greater than total profits) for 561 firms, 
representing less than one percent of the universe of motor fuel retail facilities.24 In comparison, 
approximately 2,400 facilities per year closed over the period between 2005 and 2008.25,26  In 
some cases, any exits related to regulatory costs may coincide with exits that would have 
occurred in the baseline.  Furthermore, it is likely that many of the affected facilities will also 
have options to pass through at least a portion of costs, and many small facilities may have fewer 
than three UST systems.  Therefore, EPA concludes that the market impacts associated with this 
proposed rule are likely to be diffuse and minimal, assuming a relatively uniform distribution of 
costs nationwide.   
Sensitivity Analysis 
EPA’s finding of minimal market impacts rests on an assessment of “average” facilities 
with “average” rule-related costs.  If the costs of the proposed rule are concentrated on certain 
facilities, it is possible that additional impacts (e.g., market exits) could occur.  EPA therefore 
employs several sensitivity analyses to consider alternative, “worst case” distributions of 
regulatory costs across facilities. 
To examine the extent to which the distribution of regulatory costs can be “concentrated” 
on specific facilities, EPA constructs a “worst case distribution” in which regulatory costs are 
concentrated on a subset of facilities.27  To obtain this distribution, we artificially assign costs to 
create the largest cost for the largest number of facilities, by assuming that the same facilities in 
                                                          
24 An analogous statement of this outcome is that all facilities with revenues below approximately $59,500 
per year would incur new costs equal to or in excess of profits of 1.5 percent of total revenue.  Note that U.S. Census 
data indicate that all firms in the motor fuel sector that earn less than $59,500 are single-location firms. 
25 NPN reported a station count of 161,768 in 2008, compared with 168,987 in 2005. These figures imply a 
decrease of approximately 2,400 stations, or 1.4 percent, per year. See National Petroleum News, “MarketFacts 
2008,” and NPN MarketPulse, “2005 U.S. motor fuel station count: 168,987,” both accessed at 
http://www.npnweb.com/.  
26 There is a significant discrepancy between the number of establishments reported by the 2007 Economic 
Census by the U.S. Census Bureau and the 2008 station count published by National Petroleum News. The Census 
reported 118,756 stations operating in any capacity, while NPN counted 161,768 stations. EPA contacted the Census 
Bureau, which offered three possible reasons for this discrepancy. First, grocery stores with gas stations and 
wholesale truck stops with gas stations may be categorized under grocery stores or wholesale retail instead of gas 
stations. Second, the count reported by the Census excludes non-employer establishments (10,131), which are 
family-owned and only employ family members. Third, for those establishments that do not report back to the 
Census regularly, the Bureau is not likely to record changes in establishments that have happened at the location 
(personal communication with the Office of Underground Storage Tanks, November 3, 2010).  NPN likely provides 
a more accurate reflection of the number of stations because it is an industry publication specific to the petroleum 
sector. 
27 Ideally, EPA would evaluate which facilities are likely to incur significant impacts by examining the 
specific changes each will be required to make to achieve compliance. These costs would be compared with the 
facility’s revenue and profit margin to establish whether it can incur the additional costs and remain in business. To 
EPA’s knowledge, no data of this resolution are available for the large population of facilities with UST systems. 
  5-10 
the state make every regulatory change.28  We further assume that the smallest facilities in the 
U.S. are the facilities that bear the highest cost.29 
Exhibit 5-1 displays the universe of retail motor fuel UST facilities in the United States 
when costs are allocated to concentrate impacts. This creates an allocation of costs that varies 
broadly, from as little as $30 to just over $3,400 per facility.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
28 For example, consider a state with 1,000 UST facilities that will be subject to three hypothetical technical 
requirements: Requirement A will affect 500 facilities and cost $50 per facility; Requirement B will affect 250 
facilities and cost $100 per facility; and Requirement C will affect 100 facilities and cost $200 per facility. The 
average cost for all of these facilities is $70 (((50*500) + (250*100) + (100*200))/1000).  However, the highest cost 
possible in this state is $350 (costs of $50 from Requirement A, $100 from Requirement B, and $200 from 
Requirement C), and the largest number of facilities that could incur this cost is 100 (the smallest of the universes 
affected by Requirements A,  B, or C). The next highest cost is $150 (costs of $100 from Requirement B and $50 
from Requirement A), which affect 150 facilities, excluding those also affected by Requirement C. The last group 
would be affected only by Requirement C, with 250 facilities at a cost of $50 per facility. Such an allocation of costs 
creates an unlikely outcome with a high potential for market exits.  Appendix K provides the detailed summary of 
this threshold calculation. 
29 EPA also examined a sensitivity analysis that would specifically consider the effects of "front-loading"  
capital cost requirements, but this scenario would have no effect on the results of the "worst case" sensitivity 
analysis.  The “worst case” scenario examined here already assumes simultaneous implementation of all 
requirements under the proposed rule, including several  that actually have delayed implementation schedule (e.g., 
interstitial integrity tests).   In addition, the analysis includes annualized costs for capital requirements for Indian 
country systems (e.g., secondary containment).  The “worst case” scenario does not address the replacement of 
closure of lined tanks that cannot be repaired according to a code of practice, and does not assume that full capital 
costs are incurred in a single year for affected tanks, but the facilities that would be affected by these changes are 
already among the highest cost facilities identified, and are already therefore included in the number of facilities 
potentially affected under this worst-case assumption.

One possible concern is whether facilities that are likely to face high costs are 
geographically concentrated in certain states or regions. To assess this, we examined the 
distribution of the five percent of facilities incurring the highest costs if costs were concentrated 
(specifically, 8,135 facilities incurring costs greater than $1,800). The proportion of highest-cost 
facilities does not vary substantially by state. The highest concentration of high-cost facilities 
would be 6.4 percent (in Guam); 53 of the remaining 56 states and territories (accounting for 91 
percent of retail motor fuel facilities) have roughly 5.0 percent to 6.5 percent of their facilities 
with this cost (OR, CA, and MS have fewer than four percent high-cost facilities). Differential 
economic impacts across states are not likely to occur as a result of disproportionate state-level 
impacts from this rule, even in a scenario of maximum concentration of costs across the fewest 
firms.  
To assess economic impacts in this worst case scenario, EPA pairs the distributions of 
facility size and costs to identify situations in which estimated costs would exceed 1.5 percent of 
gross sales (the average reported retail motor fuel facility profit).   Facilities with costs exceeding 
1.5 percent of revenues may face a significant economic impact under worst case assumptions.   
  5-12 
Market Exits 
Even under the adverse scenario presented above, economic impacts to affected entities 
are relatively small. The least compliant facilities in the least regulated states would incur costs 
of $3,415 in the worst case.30  This represents less than 1.5 percent of revenues for facilities 
earning more than $228,000 per year.  To assess the worst-case potential impact, EPA assumed 
that the facilities with the highest costs (those in the right-hand tail of the distribution in Exhibit 
5-1) are also the facilities with the lowest revenues and allocated costs to those facilities to 
maximize the number of potential exits. EPA estimates that 6,100 facilities earning less than 
$250,000 per year in the U.S. (in 2002 dollars) would be subject to costs exceeding 1.5 percent 
of revenues in the worst case scenario.31   To the extent that those facilities could not increase 
prices to offset higher costs, it is likely that at least some of them would exit the market.  If all of 
these facilities exited the market, the closures would constitute roughly four percent of existing 
facilities.  Note that this scenario relies on a highly unlikely confluence of assumptions, 
including: 
• All facilities with income less than $250,000 have average configurations of 
three UST systems.  In fact, it is likely that small facilities have fewer than three 
tanks and would therefore not be subject to the facility-level costs estimated here 
It is likely that the smallest facilities also operate only a single UST system, 
which would reduce their compliance costs by approximately 67 percent.32  Under 
such circumstances, most small operators would not be subject to a significant 
economic impact even in the worst-case scenario. 
• No facility has any option to increase prices on goods or services or to 
identify options for savings.    While gasoline prices are unlikely to rise in 
response to this proposed rule, consumers may be willing to pay marginal cost 
increases on other products and services.  Moreover, in remote rural areas, 
retailers may be able to directly pass costs on to consumers.  
                                                          
30 Facility costs of roughly $3,400 or less are representative of approximately 99 percent of worst-case, 
high-end cost outcomes. Facilities in Indian country are the only exception, as they will also be required to comply 
with additional regulations for operator training and secondary containment. Because this group of facilities 
represents only roughly one percent of facilities with costs at or above $3,400, we do not present them as the main 
highest-cost scenario. 
31 The U.S. Census identified 5,142 facilities that earned less than $250,000 in 2002. For the purposes of its 
SBA analysis, EPA revised this estimate upward by 46 percent to reconcile disparities between Census gas stations 
counts from 2002 and NACS gas station counts from 2008. Of the estimated 7,520 facilities earning less than 
$250,000 per year in 2002, we arrayed the highest cost facilities with the highest revenue facilities, to ensure an 
estimate of as many exits as possible. See Appendix K for a detailed explanation of our methods. 
32 According to the 2009 NACS Convenience Store Industry Fact Book, the average motor fuel retailing 
facility has monthly throughput of approximately 118,500 gallons.  As discussed in Chapter 2, we believe that the 
average motor fuel retailer operates approximately 3 UST systems. This equates to roughly 39,500 gallons of 
monthly throughput per system. In addition, based on information from a mid-size retail fuel marketer, EPA believes 
that a facility requires a minimum throughput of approximately 30,000 gallons per month to remain economically 
viable, which equates to upward of $50,000 in revenues per month given gasoline prices in excess of $2.00 since 
2005. See http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epmr_pte_dpgal_a.htm. 
  5-13 
• A profit margin of 1.5 percent is standard.  Companies have a clear incentive 
to minimize taxable profits when filing income taxes with the IRS.  Because net 
income (profit) is taxable, corporations that are not publicly traded typically take 
legitimate steps (e.g., year-end investments in equipment, employee bonuses) to 
reduce both net income and tax burdens. As a result, a 1.5 percent after-tax profit 
estimate based on IRS data is likely to understate average profitability.   
Finally, this analysis does not adjust the Census data on facility revenues for inflation, though 
costs are presented in 2008 dollars.  Due to the variability of gasoline pricing, we adopt a 
conservative assumption that revenues have remained static in nominal terms since 2002. 
While our sensitivity analysis suggests that just over 6,100 facilities may be at risk of significant 
economic impacts in a worst case scenario, it is unlikely that a significant number of actual 
market exits would result from the proposed regulation. A plausible exception to this finding 
exists in cases where a facility with high upgrade costs faces high levels of local competition.   
Even in these cases, closures would likely be consistent with the recent rate of industry 
consolidation of 1.4 percent per year.  
Price Impacts 
The high sensitivity of local demand to changes in retail motor fuel prices makes it 
unlikely that firms will react to the proposed rule by raising gasoline prices, However, the cost of 
other goods and services could potentially increase as firms seek to offset regulatory costs 
through sales of other products. Retailers will likely increase the prices of goods that are 
relatively price inelastic, such as tobacco products, auto service charges, or snack food and other 
convenience items.  
Employment Impacts 
The increased operating costs incurred by facilities to comply with this proposed rule 
may result in very slightly increased prices for their goods and services, as previously discussed. 
 These potential price increases may result in reduced demand and thus reduced output of the 
facilities' goods and services. This could translate into lower demand for labor, a result 
commonly referred to as the demand effect.  As discussed earlier, the price effect is expected to 
be small though, and given the relatively inelastic demand for gasoline, the demand effect is 
likely to be small as well.  There is also the potential for the proposed rule to result in a small 
number of facilities exiting the market, which could result in a temporary negative employment 
effect as these workers look for other positions.   However, as noted earlier and in the next 
section below, these exits may coincide with exits that would already occur in the baseline.33 In 
addition, given the competitive nature of the retail motor fuel sector and the similar regulatory 
costs faced by each facility, many of these facilities may be able to pass through at least a portion 
                                                          
33 See footnote 25.   
  5-14 
of these costs (see Price Impacts section above).34  As a result, the potential employment effect 
of market exits from the proposed rule is likely small. 
 Furthermore, some of the requirements of the proposed rule may have a positive impact 
on employment. For example, walkthrough inspections require labor as a primary input which 
may lead to small increases in employment at regulated facilities.35  In addition, the increased 
demand for testing services and training under the proposed rule may also lead to increased 
demand for labor.  Since the proposed rule could potentially affect the demand for labor both 
positively and negatively, the overall direction of net employment impacts is unclear, but is most 
likely very small relative to the size of the industry.   
 
Long-run Economic Impacts 
The proposed rule is unlikely to generate substantial additional impacts in the long run, 
but in a worst-case scenario it could accelerate ongoing consolidation trends in the retail motor 
fuel sector if market exits result. NPN reports that 168,987 motor fuel stations operated in the 
United States in 2005. By 2008, this number had fallen to 161,768, a decrease of 4.3 percent 
compared with 2005, or approximately 1.4 percent per year.36 While broader market 
consolidation is related to ownership strategies among oil companies and general economic 
patterns, facilities facing significant periodic costs (e.g. UST system replacement) may be most 
likely to close. Similarly, facilities with higher operating costs as a result of the rule may opt to 
close. In such cases, exits caused by the rule are likely to affect the most marginal firms and 
would likely coincide to some extent with exits that would have occurred in the absence of the 
proposed rule. These closures will occur in the context of the national decline in the number of 
facilities, such that the rule is unlikely to cause a significant number of closures beyond those 
that will occur as part of the existing trend.  
5.2.4 Assessment of Public Sector Cost Savings Related to Avoided Releases 
A significant positive effect of the proposed rule derives from its impact on state funds 
created for the purpose of providing a financial responsibility mechanism to UST owners and 
operators. Among 56 state and territory governments, 43 have an existing fund created for the 
purpose of remediating releases; of these, 36 are active and continue to accept claims.37 In many 
of these states, owners and operators are required to pay for a portion of remedial actions through 
                                                          
34 Note that small marginal facilities are also likely to have fewer than three UST systems and thus face 
lower than average facility-level compliance costs. 
35 For example, EPA estimates that monthly walkthrough inspections of a facility will take nearly an hour 
to complete, on average.  A compliant owner or operator in a state that does not currently have this requirement will 
need to allocate 12 man-hours of incremental effort per year to satisfy this portion of the proposed rule.

deductibles that generally range from zero to $100,000.38 Given an average cost of remediation 
of $127,216 in 2009, however, state funds are frequently required to finance some portion of 
remediation costs.39 These state funds are created by state legislation and must be submitted to 
EPA for approval before they can be used as financial responsibility mechanisms. In most cases, 
states generate money for their funds by levying tank registration and petroleum fees, which are 
then used to provide payments for remediation of releases beyond the deductibles paid by 
responsible parties. In states where funds rely on gas taxes and accept claims related to releases, 
these expenditures represent subsidies from the public to owners or operators responsible for 
releases.  
The extent to which the proposed regulations reduce the occurrence of new releases 
produces two welcome effects:  
• Assignment of costs. Fewer releases implies lower expenditures from state funds.  
This represents a reduction in this public subsidy and a reassignment of costs 
from the public remediation costs to private entity prevention costs. This 
improves market signaling and efficiency by requiring owners and operators to 
focus on release prevention.   
• Competitive effects. High-performing owners or operators are less likely to incur 
significant regulatory costs than low-performing owners or operators.  As a result, 
the regulatory costs and cost savings improve the alignment of incentives to focus 
on private-sector prevention costs and reduce public-sector remediation costs.   
To illustrate the potential magnitude of the public expenditures that could be affected by the 
regulation (i.e., distributional effects), we examine states that have active state funds and 
categorize them into those that finance their funds via petroleum and tank fees (“Tier 1”), or via 
only a tank fee (“Tier 2”).40  
We assume that states that are required to comply with a larger number of the new 
requirements will experience a greater reduction of releases, all other things equal. To estimate 
the distribution of avoided releases, we calculate the average number of requirements with which

that in most cases, the State Fund incurs remediation costs, except that the owner or operator typically bears the cost 
of immediately stopping the leak.  In addition, New Hampshire indicated the owner or operator typically pays a 
$5,000 deductible towards the final remediation cost, and in New Mexico, the owner or operator typically pays a 
deductible between $0 and $10,000.

the systems in each state will need to comply. 41 We assign avoided releases based on both the 
number of systems in a state and the average number of requirements on each system, and we 
value releases based on the national profile of avoided releases and avoided groundwater 
incidents.42 Using ASTSWMO data, we subtract from our estimate of the potential cost borne by 
the public the deductible that owners or operators would be expected to pay.43 See Appendix N 
for a discussion of the methodology used. 
Exhibit 5-2 presents the results of our screening-level assessment.  Among the 36 states 
with active state funds that fall into Tier 1 or Tier 2, we find that the potential reduction in public 
expenditures could reach $191 million to $431 under the Preferred Option, with $150 million to 
$338 million in Tier 1 and $41 million to $94 million in Tier 2.44  Reductions in public 
expenditures would equal approximately $198 million to $457 million under Alternative 1 and 
$80 million to $340 million under Alternative 2.  These savings would be slightly lower in a 
scenario where deductibles are in the upper end of their ranges. We note that, to realize the 
savings in public expenditures, state government action would be required to lower petroleum 
fees. Alternatively, the extent that funds are not constrained in their use, a redistribution of funds 
(e.g., to backlog sites awaiting cleanup) could also represent a significant public benefit. The 
values presented in this table do not reflect discounting to account for regulatory compliance 
schedules. 
Note that this screening-level analysis is intended only to identify the potential magnitude 
of impacts on state fund liabilities.  A more detailed analysis of specific state program costs and 
the likely distribution of avoided releases would be necessary to precisely measure potential 
savings. Overall, the values in Exhibit 5-2 suggest that requiring owners and operators to focus 
on prevention reduces costs to state financial assurance funds by over $150 million under the 
Preferred Option and Alternative 1 and upward of $50 million for Alternative 2. 
 
 
 
                                                          
41 We use the number of times a system is affected rather than the actual number of systems affected 
because we lack the data to determine which units are affected by each requirement. For example, if two 
requirements each affect 1,000 and 500 units, respectively, they may ultimately affect between 1,000 and 1,500 
units, depending upon whether any overlap exists among the two regulated universes.  
42 We calculate this as avoided costs due to avoided releases divided by number of releases avoided. The 
procedure is similar for avoided groundwater remediation costs.  
43  We rely on the ASTSWMO Fund Survey Results 2008 for the data that underlie our construction of 
tiers. These data are available at http://www.astswmo.org/publications_tanks.htm. 
44 Due to our calculation methods, two states with very high deductibles (Minnesota and Virginia) showed 
deductible amounts and avoided releases that exceed their estimated avoided release costs. We exclude them from 
our calculations, such that our estimates for likely underestimate the potential for redistributive effects.

5.2.5 Economic Impact Summary 
This set of analyses shows that it is unlikely that the proposed rule will have substantial 
negative economic impacts on the regulated community, in part because the costs of the rule 
appear to be evenly distributed across a large population of facilities, and remain modest at the 
facility level. Even under a highly improbable worst case scenario in which the highest costs are 
incurred by the smallest facilities, roughly four percent of the universe of retail motor fuel 
facilities would potentially incur costs greater than publicly reported industry average profit 
margins.  Market exits of roughly 2,400 facilities annually represent the current market trend.  It 
is likely, therefore, that most or all market exits under this proposed rule would coincide with 
exits of specific out-of-date facilities that are on the brink of exiting, and would not create a 
significant additional contraction of the total market.   
A more likely response by many affected firms will be to adapt by increasing prices on 
higher margin products and services.  While overall employment impacts are unclear, it is 
possible that there may be an increase in labor demand due to the additional requirements placed 
on owners and operators, and additional demand for third-party testing services.  
In addition, it appears that the proposed rule could have a positive impact on state 
governments that currently fund a portion of UST-related remediation costs through gasoline 
taxes and fees.  A decrease in the number and severity of releases represents cost savings to 
states due to decreased demand on state financial assurance funds. Our initial screening 
assessment suggests that annual costs to states could be reduced by over $150 million.  This 
represents a reduction in a public subsidy and an improvement in market signaling. 
5.3  Energy Impact Analysis 
Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations that Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use” (May 18, 2001), addresses the need for regulators to consider the potential 
energy impacts of the proposed rule and resulting actions.  Under Executive Order 13211, 
agencies are required to prepare a Statement of Energy Effects when a regulatory action may 
  5-18 
have significant adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use, including impacts on price 
and foreign supplies.  Additionally, the requirements obligate agencies to consider reasonable 
alternatives to regulatory actions with adverse effects and the impacts that such alternatives 
might have on energy supply, distribution, or use. 
The proposed rule affects underground storage tanks used in the storage of motor fuel or 
emergency generator fuel.  However, it is not likely that this proposed rule will have significant 
impacts on energy supply, distribution, or use.  To assess the energy impacts of the proposed 
rule, EPA considers potential changes in energy supply and use associated with the total costs 
estimated in Chapter 3.  The following summarizes EPA’s assessment of the energy impacts that 
the proposed rule will have in energy supply, distribution, and use.   
Energy Supply and Distribution 
The proposed rule consists of additional regulatory requirements that apply to the owners 
and operators of underground storage tanks.  To the extent that the proposed rule affects the 
motor fuel sector, it does so at the retail motor fuel sales level, rather than the level of refineries 
or distributors who supply the retail stations with motor fuel.  Correspondingly, we do not expect 
the proposed rule to have any impacts on energy supply or distribution. 
In terms of local motor fuel availability, we believe two outcomes are possible. If a motor 
fuel station is located in an area where competition from other stations exists, we do not believe 
fuel prices will be affected. Rather, owners and operators will seek to recover the costs of the 
proposed rule by increasing the prices of convenience items. If a station does not also operate a 
convenience store through which it can recover these costs, it may become subject to a 
significant economic impact and exit the market. In such a case, however, supply will not be 
disrupted, as other competitors fill the void left by the former market participant. 
We do not expect market exits to occur in low-competition environments due to the 
market power of stations and the marginal nature of the increase in cost. If a motor fuel station is 
located in an area where competition is not intense (e.g., a rural setting), it may opt to directly 
pass on higher costs through increases in fuel or convenience goods prices. As we discuss below, 
even if the entire cost of the rule is priced through to consumers, the change in fuel prices is not 
likely to be measurable.  
  5-19 
Energy Use 
The additional regulatory requirements contained in the proposed rule may increase 
compliance costs for owners and operators of retail motor fuel stations.  If the owners and 
operators of retail motor fuel stations affected by the proposed rule can successfully pass through 
their increased compliance costs, energy use may be affected through higher energy prices 
caused by the proposed rule.  However, we do not expect a significant change in retail gasoline 
prices to result from this proposed rule for the follow reasons: 
• Economic analyses of retail fuel prices have revealed that demand for gasoline is 
highly sensitive to price (elastic) within localized geographic areas.  
• As a result, if one motor fuel retailer in an area passes through increases in 
compliance costs by increasing gasoline prices, while another does not, the one 
with higher prices is at a significant competitive disadvantage. 
• Retail motor fuel stations often have associated stores and/or services, such as car 
washes, repair operations, and convenience outlets, on which they can more 
successfully pass through increases in compliance costs.   
When considered in the context of total fuel consumption in the United States, the proposed rule 
would represent only a very small fraction of motor fuel prices even if it was fully passed 
through to consumers. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the United States 
consumed 170,765,000,000 gallons of motor fuel (including gasoline and diesel) in 2008 at an 
average price of $3.27.45  This implies that U.S. consumers spent $558 billion in 2008 on motor 
fuel. The overall cost of the proposed rule is roughly $210 million, less than one-tenth of one 
percent of the amount spent by end-users on motor fuel in 2008. In comparison, an increase of 
$0.01 in the average price of motor fuel in 2008 would have increased the total cost to consumers 
by approximately $1.7 billion. Given these circumstances, the proposed rule should not have a 
measurable impact on retail prices.   
5.4 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) as amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), 5 USC 601 et seq., generally requires EPA to 
prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute.  This analysis must be 
completed unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. If a regulation is found to have a significant impact on a 
                                                          
45 The 2008 prices per gallon for all grades of retail motor gasoline and No. 2 diesel fuel (all concentrations 
of sulfur) were $3.32 and $3.15, respectively, as reported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in Table 3-8: 
Sales Price of Transportation Fuel to End-Users in National Transportation Statistics 2010 (at 
http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/pdf/entire.pdf).  We weight these prices according 
to prime supplier sales volumes in 2009 published by the Energy Information Administration, which summed to 
362,798.5 thousands of gallons per day for gasoline and 132,489.3 thousands of gallons per day for all grades of 
diesel fuel (at http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_prim_dcu_nus_a.htm). 
  5-20 
substantial number of small entities, further analysis must be performed to determine what can 
be done to lessen the impact.  Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and 
small governmental jurisdictions.  EPA developed a screening analysis and supplemental 
analysis consistent with the requirements under RFA; this section presents a summary of these 
findings, and Appendix L provides the detailed screening analysis.46 
For purposes of assessing the impacts of this rule on small entities, a small entity is 
defined as: (1) a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 
regulations at 13 CFR Part 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of 
a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and 
(3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and 
operated and is not dominant in its field.  For the purposes of this analysis, EPA considered costs 
in excess of one percent and three percent of revenues as indications that the proposed rule may 
have a significant impact on a given small entity, and estimates of greater than 20 percent of total 
small firms or 1,000 total small firms affected as indications that a substantial number of small 
entities may be affected by the proposed rule.  
5.4.1 Small Business Screening Analysis 
We estimate that there are approximately 83,900 firms operating 162,000 facilities in the 
U.S. retail motor fuel sales sector.47  This analysis assumes that all retail motor fuels firms 
operate underground storage tanks (UST systems) at all of their facilities.  Based on the 
distribution of firms across revenue categories published by the 2002 Census, and SBA’s 
revenue thresholds for NAICS 447110 and 447190, approximately 82,500 (98 percent) of these 
firms meet SBA’s definition of a small entity.48  Approximately 7,520 of these firms report 
revenues between $0 and $250,000 (the smallest revenue range published by the 2002 Census), 
with average sales of approximately $149,000.49   
                                                          
46 This section focuses on the retail motor fuel sector.  As discussed in Appendix L, EPA’s screening 
assessment indicates that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
entities (SISNOSE) across all affected sectors.  However, because 80 percent of all UST systems are in the retail 
motor fuel sector, we refined the screening assessment to further examine the potential impacts of the proposed rule 
on this sector. 
47 NAICS code 447 is comprised of 447110 (Gasoline stations with convenience stores) and 447190 (Other 
gasoline stations).  To reconcile differing estimates of the number of retail fuel facilities (roughly 162,000 estimated 
by NPN, and 110,600 estimated by the Census), a 1.46 adjustment factor was applied to the Census data to inflate 
the number of retail motor fuel facilities to 162,000, distributed proportionately across revenue ranges.  This 
approach preserves the distribution of firms by size according to Census data. As a result of this approach, we 
estimate that there are a total of approximately 83,900 firms and 481,000 tanks in the retail motor fuel sector.  
48 For 447110, the SBA revenue threshold is $27 million; for 447190, the SBA revenue threshold is $9 
million.  To ensure that we do not underestimate the number of small entities, we assume that all firms within a 
revenue bin that contains a specific SBA revenue threshold value are small.  For example, if the SBA small business 
size threshold for a sector is $7 million, we assume that all firms in the revenue range of $5 to $10 million are small. 
49  Note that for simplicity we identify size categories in this document as described by the 2002 Census 
(e.g., revenues up to $250,000 in 2002 dollars), and identify compliance costs in 2008 dollars.   However, in the 
actual screening analysis, compliance costs have been adjusted from 2008 dollars to 2002 dollars using the GDP 
implicit deflator.  The estimated compliance cost is $300 per system in 2008 dollars, or $255 per tank in 2002 
  5-21 
 
To determine whether firms reporting revenues within a given revenue range would incur 
costs exceeding one percent or three percent of total revenue, EPA compares the average total 
compliance cost per firm with the average revenue reported by firms in the revenue range. Based 
on a compliance cost per system of $300 (in 2008 dollars), and assuming that firms in the 
smallest revenue range own one facility with three UST systems, we estimate that the 7,520 
small firms in the $0-$250,000 revenue range would face total compliance costs of $892 per firm 
(or $757 in 2002 dollars).50  Any firm with annual revenues above approximately $75,700 (in 
2002 dollars) (i.e., the revenue threshold at which compliance costs would exceed one percent of 
the firm’s revenue) is not expected to experience a significant impact.  The average revenue for 
the 7,520 firms in the $0-$250,000 revenue bin is $149,000, suggesting that on average, firms in 
this category will not experience significant impacts due to estimated compliance costs. 
 
However, because the lowest range reported by the U.S. Census reflects a distribution of 
firms with revenues between $0 and $250,000, it is still possible that some of the 7,520 firms in 
this category may be significantly affected. As mentioned above, EPA also considered estimates 
of greater than 20 percent of total small firms or 1,000 total small firms affected as indications 
that a substantial number of small entities may be affected by the proposed rule. While the 7,520 
small firms in the lowest revenue range represent only nine percent of all potentially affected 
small firms, EPA conducted a supplemental analysis that focuses on this group of small firms in 
an attempt to refine the estimated number of small firms potentially affected by the proposed 
rule. 
5.4.2 Small Business Supplemental Analysis 
 The purpose of this supplemental analysis is to refine the results of the small business 
screening analysis.  The Census Bureau provided additional data on firms in the lowest revenue 
bins for NAICS sectors 447110 (gasoline stations with convenience stores) and 447190 (other 
gasoline stations), identifying the percentage of firms with revenues in three ranges: (1) $0-
$50,000; (2) $50,000-$150,000; and (3) $150,000-$250,000.51  Based on this information, we 
estimate the number of firms in the retail motor fuel sales sector (i.e., NAICS 447) for these three 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
dollars. These costs exclude compliance costs associated with the removal of deferrals for AHFDSs and UST 
systems with FCTs.  AHFDS and FCT systems are primarily owned by the Department of Defense and not by any 
small entities. 
50 Census data on number of facilities per firm indicate that virtually all firms earning less than $250,000 
per year in 2002 had only one facility.  We therefore use “firm” and “facility” interchangeably in this context. 
51 The information provided by the U.S. Census Bureau is considered an “unpublished data request.”  As 
such, while the Census Bureau provided the data we requested, they also included a letter noting that “these are not 
‘official data’ from the Census Bureau, since they do not meet the Census Bureau’s quality standards.  These data 
should be used with extreme caution, realizing the severe quality limitations that may exist.”  However, given that 
we do not have another source of information, we use this as the best data available. 
  5-22 
revenue groups at approximately 550, 3,120, and 3,860, respectively and use these data to refine 
our estimate of the number of significantly affected facilities.52  
Given compliance costs of $892 per firm ($757 in 2002 dollars), any firm making less 
than $75,700 and $30,000 would be considered significantly affected at the one percent and three 
percent revenue thresholds, respectively.  EPA estimates that 1,348 firms are affected at the one 
percent threshold, and no firms are affected at the three percent threshold.   
 
The number of firms that will be significantly affected at the one percent threshold 
exceeds the one thousand-firm substantial effect benchmark by 348 firms.  However, it is likely 
that this proposed rule will have no SISNOSE for three reasons.  First, 1,348 firms represent 
roughly one percent of potentially affected small firms, which is significantly lower than the 20 
percent threshold (the other parameter considered in this analysis to determine a “substantial 
number”).53  Second, although the U.S. Census Bureau reports several hundred facilities with 
annual revenues less that $100,000, market economics suggest that it would be difficult for a 
firm that relies solely on gasoline sales to be viable if earning less than $100,000 in annual 
revenues, suggesting that some of these facilities may not be standalone entities.54  Finally, at 
least some of the smallest facilities are likely to have fewer than the three tanks used as a basis 
for facility-level costs.  EPA thus finds that the proposed rule does not appear likely to have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. 
5.4.3 Impacts to Small Governments 
The 1992 Local Government Economic Impact Analysis provides the best readily-
available data on the number of governments owning UST systems, total UST systems owned by 
governments, average UST systems per government, and UST systems per owning government.  
The data include size and revenue for both general purpose (i.e., counties, municipalities, and 
townships) and special district governments (i.e., school districts and other special districts), 
dividing these governments into four size categories: very large, large, medium and small. The 
1992 analysis defines a “very large” government as one that serves over 50,000 people; 
                                                          
52 The analysis interpolates between the lower and upper bounds of each range and assumes a uniform 
distribution of facilities within each range. The lowest revenue interval is bounded at $35,750, which EPA obtains 
from estimating the linear trend between the zero and $250,000 in revenues. The implicit assumption is that no 
facilities earn less than that level of revenue  
53 EPA estimates a total of roughly 116,000 small firms with USTs across all affected sectors; 1,348 is 
roughly 1.2 percent of these.  In NAICS 447, the 1,348 affected facilities represent 1.6 percent of facilities. 
54 Assuming $2 per gallon in sales, a facility earning $100,000 would sell less than 4,200 gallons of 
gasoline per month, compared with the monthly industry average throughput of approximately 130,000 gallons.  
Based on information from a mid-size retail fuel marketer, EPA believes that a facility requires a minimum 
throughput of approximately 30,000 gallons per month to remain economically viable.  In addition, a facility would 
need $108,000 to generate enough gross profit to cover the direct cost of the wages of one full-time employee at 
minimum wage ($15,080 at $7.25 per hour and 2080 hours, before accounting for employment taxes). This does not 
consider other costs, such as electricity, property taxes, or franchise fees.  As a result, while the supplemental 
analysis indicates that 1,348 firms will face costs that exceed the one percent revenue threshold, it is not clear 
whether all of these facilities represent average motor fuel retailers with full scale operations, three UST systems, 
and no other income. 
  5-23 
therefore, all other entities are considered to be small governmental jurisdictions according to the 
RFA/SBREFA definition. Using the data from the 1992 analysis, we estimate the number of 
small governments that own UST systems based on the total universe of UST systems today.  
See Appendix L for additional detail. 
EPA assumes that local governments collectively own four percent of active tanks. This 
equates to 24,458 tanks, based on the fiscal year 2009 universe of 611,449 tanks.55 These 24,458 
tanks are distributed among all local governments, based upon the percentage of tanks owned in 
1992 by local governments in each size category (the average number of tanks owned by a 
government varies with the size of the government from one tank for small governments to 10 or 
more tanks for the largest governments).  
EPA then calculates, using the 1992 data on government ownership of UST systems, the 
average compliance cost per government entity. This is done by multiplying the cost per tank by 
the number of UST systems per government by size category. The average annual revenue for 
each size of general purpose government is calculated using 2002 Census Data and weighted-
average contributions that depend on type of entity (i.e., towns, municipalities, and counties). 
EPA extrapolates Census data on revenues for 4,128 townships to the 16,504 townships in the 
country. These weighted averages are combined to obtain annual revenues in 2002 dollars for 
general purpose governments, then inflated to 2008 dollars. Detailed information at the special 
district level is not available for later years, so budget expenditures from the 1992 analysis were 
inflated into 2008 dollars.56   
To calculate how many small governments face significant compliance costs exceeding 
one or three percent of their revenues, we compared the average compliance cost per government 
with the average annual revenues to determine how many exceed either threshold. At a cost of 
$300 (2008 dollars) per UST system, no small governments are affected under either the one 
percent or three percent revenue threshold (see Exhibit 5-3). Correspondingly, EPA does not 
find that the proposed rule has any significant impact on a substantial number of small 
governments. 
                                                          
55 Estimates of local government UST systems adjusted from 1992 ICF Analysis using The 1987 Census of 
Governments.  See “Economic Impact Analysis of Additional Mechanisms for Local Government Entities to 
Demonstrate Financial Responsibility for Underground Storage Tanks,” December 1992, Exhibit 3-1. Consistent 
with this analysis, the number of government UST systems is assumed to be one percent of all 2009 UST systems 
for state and federal governments and four percent of all 2009 UST systems for local governments. 
56 Typically, a RFA/SBREFA screening assessment uses revenues to assess economic impact measures for 
small governments. In the absence of detailed 2002 data, we use 1992 budget expenditures as a proxy for revenues.

5.5 Screening Analysis to Inform Impacts on Minority and Low-Income Populations 
Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
Populations and Low-Income Populations) (59 FR 7629, Feb. 16, 1994) directs federal agencies, 
to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to identify and address, as appropriate, 
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, 
policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.     
 To inform us about the socioeconomic characteristics of communities potentially affected 
by the rule, EPA conducted a screening analysis to examine whether there is a statistically 
significant disparity between socioeconomic characteristics of populations located near UST 
facilities and those that are not.57  The results indicate that minority and low-income populations 
                                                          
57 Note that the affected populations identified in the screening analysis summarized here are simply 
defined by specific demographics surrounding UST locations.  These affected populations are not necessarily 
equivalent to communities that others have specifically identified as “environmental justice communities.”   
  5-25 
are slightly more likely to be located near UST facilities.  An environmental justice analysis 
would then require an assessment of whether there would be disproportionate and adverse 
impacts on these populations.  However, because all regulatory options considered in this 
proposed rule would increase regulatory stringency and reduce the number and size of releases, 
EPA does not anticipate that the proposed rule will have any disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental effects on these minority or low income communities, or on any 
community. 
5.5.1 Risk Assessment Population Analysis 
To characterize the extent of human health risk reductions anticipated under the proposed 
regulation, EPA conducted a screening-level analysis of the likely impact of the rule on benzene-
related cancer incidence.  This analysis used location data for nearly 60,000 U.S. gas stations 
with UST systems using an ESRI Business Analyst database, and examined populations within a 
buffer distance of 1,000 feet of facilities with UST systems.  The ESRI gas station location data 
are supplemented with 1,600 UST systems in Indian country, based on location information 
compiled from EPA regional Indian country databases. After elimination of duplicates, the data 
set contains 59,945 UST facilities (including 727 in Indian country) (see Exhibit 5-4).  The total 
data set represents over 25 percent of the roughly 220,000 active facilities with UST systems.58 
To estimate populations near sample facilities, the analysis uses a “synthetic population” 
dataset developed by the Modeling of Infection Diseases Agents Study (MIDAS) to provide 
population estimates at a finer spatial resolution than Census blocks, while maintaining the 
accuracy of aggregate demographic data at the Census block group level.  For more detail on this 
method, see Appendix M. 
The modeled fate and transport of pollutants under a range of scenarios indicates that the 
contamination from UST releases do not typically exceed 1,000 feet.59  The risk assessment 
considered population density within 1,000 feet of each UST, and incorporated estimates of the 
use of groundwater for drinking and bathing, along with typical exposure scenarios, to 
characterize the change in population risk likely to be associated with the reduction of 2,821 
releases and groundwater incidents (i.e., the total estimated number of avoided releases and 
groundwater incidents resulting from the proposed regulations).  The risk assessment concluded 
that the proposed regulations will result in a very small reduction in population risk related to 
cancer from benzene exposure, based on the estimated number and volume of avoided releases 
and groundwater incidents.

methodology does not capture all locations, it is not differentially focused on any specific region or information 
source, and therefore likely represents a reasonable spatial distribution of facilities.

5.5.2 Demographic Analysis 
The demographic analysis expands on the population data near the 59,945 gas stations in 
the risk assessment by characterizing demographic features of populations at each site and 
comparing these populations to larger (county-level) reference populations.60  Specifically, the 
analysis examines the following demographic variables: percent in poverty, percent minority, 
and, as a verification step, percent white alone (the percentage of the population that specified 
their race as “white” and did not specify “Hispanic”).  The analysis also identifies percent under 
five years old, percent under 18 years old to support the analysis required under Executive Order 
13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks” (see section 
                                                          
60 County-level statistics provide a useful comparative measure for the populations at the local facility 
level. Given that the area of interest is small (i.e., 1000 feet of a facility), the county-level provides an appropriate 
scale for comparison.  
  5-27 
5.6 below).  The analysis considers the significance of the “difference in means” and “difference 
in median” values for each census parameter and each community.  That is, the analysis 
identifies the differences between mean and median concentrations of each demographic group 
for the affected and reference populations at each of the 59,945 sites, and examines whether the 
differences identified across all sites are statistically different from what would be expected in a 
random distribution.61 
The analysis considers the differences in demographics in two ways:  unweighted (each 
site is given equal weight) and population weighted (results are weighted by affected persons, 
giving sites with larger populations more weight).  A statistically significant positive difference 
indicates a greater percentage of target demographic in the affected population than in the larger 
reference population.  A statistically significant negative difference indicates a smaller 
percentage of the target demographic in the affected population.   Exhibit 5-5 provides the 
unweighted results of the analysis and generally finds that minority and low-income 
demographics constitute a slightly larger proportion of the population surrounding UST facilities. 
For example, poor populations account for 13.3 percent of the population near an UST, 
compared with 12.2 percent of the reference (county) population.  As Exhibit 5-6 shows, 
although the difference is small, it is also highly statistically significant (with a p-value below 
.001), which suggests that the difference between the values is not a random occurrence. 
Exhibits 5-7 and 5-8 summarize the results of the population-weighted analysis, and generally 
find slightly larger (but still small) effects.

1000 foot buffer. 
 
Overall, the demographic analysis identifies a small but statistically significant difference 
between minority and low-income populations near UST systems and in the reference 
communities.   Minority and poverty-level demographics are present at greater percentages in the 
vicinity of UST facilities.  In contrast, a small negative relationship suggests that “white alone” 
  5-30 
populations are less likely to be near UST systems, i.e., minority populations are marginally 
more likely to reside near UST facilities.  Moreover, while the unweighted analysis does not find 
clear patterns related to children under 18 and children under five, the population-weighted 
analysis finds that the distribution of all target demographics around UST facilities reflects small 
but significant differences from county-level populations. The population-weighted results show 
greater differences, suggesting that facilities in higher population areas tend to have more 
pronounced disparities between local, potentially affected communities and reference (county-
level) communities. These differences, while small, are statistically significant with p-values less 
than 0.01 in all cases.   This result implies that any risk reductions associated with the proposed 
rule will occur in the context of a baseline condition in which minority and low-income 
populations are disproportionately located near USTs. 
 
5.5.3   Summary and Limitations of the Analysis 
This section summarizes a screening assessment and does not present a complete 
environmental justice analysis.  The assessment is limited by the fact that demographic data from 
the U.S. Census are at the block group level, and are not as precise as the spatial distribution of 
population.  As a result, if the demographic distribution of populations within block groups is 
uneven, the block group-level data may not accurately characterize populations living nearest to 
UST locations.  The large sample of 59,945 sites, however, reduces the potential that this 
uncertainty could skew the results of the analysis. 
Given the results of the screening analysis, because all regulatory options considered in 
this proposed rule would increase regulatory stringency and reduce the number and size of 
releases, EPA does not anticipate the proposed rule to have any disproportionately high and 
adverse human health or environmental effects on these minority or low income communities, or 
on any community.  Since the proposed rule is not anticipated to create any new adverse human 
health or environmental impacts, EPA did not conduct a complete environmental justice analysis.   
5.6 Children’s Health Protection Analysis 
Executive Order 13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and 
Safety Risks” (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) is determined to be 
“economically significant” as defined under E.O. 12866, and (2) concerns an environmental 
health or safety risk that EPA has reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on 
children. If the regulatory action meets both criteria, the Agency must evaluate the 
environmental health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the 
planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives 
considered by the Agency.  
This action may be subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is economically 
significant as defined in Executive Order 12866.  EPA’s screening-level risk assessment 
examines potential impacts to groundwater and subsequent chemical transport, exposure and 
risk. While the risk assessment did not specifically measure exposure to children, the general 
  5-31 
exposure scenarios reflect four exposure pathways that have the most significant potential for 
human health impacts.  These are:  
• ingestion of chemicals in groundwater that have migrated from the source area to 
residential drinking water wells 
• inhalation of volatile chemicals when showering with contaminated groundwater 
• dermal contact with chemicals while bathing or showering with contaminated 
groundwater 
• inhalation of vapors that may migrate upward from contaminated groundwater 
into overlying buildings 
Adults and children can potentially be exposed through all four exposure pathways considered.   
For adults, inhalation of vapors while showering is the most significant adult exposure pathway; 
for children, ingestion is the most significant pathway, because children are assumed to take 
baths and are therefore not exposed via shower vapor inhalation.  As a result of the longer 
exposure from showering, adults are the more sensitive receptor for cancer effects compared to 
children, particularly those under five who are assumed to take more baths and fewer showers.62 
While the screening level risk assessment is limited in that it only examines benzene 
impacts, the proposed rule would likely reduce other contaminant exposures to children in a 
similar pattern, and would not create significant adverse impacts on children’s health. 
The screening-level demographic analysis described in section 5.5 finds a statistically 
significant result that children under the age of 18 and children under the age of five are slightly 
less likely to be found in the vicinity of UST facilities. This suggests that the impacts of the 
proposed rule will not have a disproportionate impact on children’s health. Moreover, because all 
regulatory options proposed today would increase regulatory stringency and reduce the number 
and size of releases, EPA does not expect the proposed rule to have any disproportionate adverse 
impact on children.

Chapter 6.  Other Statutory and Executive Order Analyses  
 
As required by applicable statutes and executive orders, this chapter summarizes our 
analysis of equity considerations and other regulatory concerns associated with the proposed 
rule. This chapter assesses potential impacts, with respect to the following issues:  
 
• Regulatory planning and review: requires examination and quantification of 
costs and benefits of regulating with and without the proposed rule. 
 
• Unfunded mandates: examines the implications of the proposed rule with 
respect to unfunded mandates. 
 
• Federalism: considers potential issues related to state sovereignty. 
 
• Tribal governments: extends the discussion of federal unfunded mandates to 
include impacts on Native American tribal governments and their communities. 
 
• Joint impacts of rules: discusses how other rules, together with the proposed 
rule, will likely affect the universe of facilities regulated by the proposed rule. 
6.1  Regulatory Planning and Review  
Under Executive Order 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], EPA, in conjunction 
with the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA), must determine whether a regulatory action is “significant” and therefore 
subject to OMB review and the full requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines 
“significant regulatory action” as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  
(1)  Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect 
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
tribal governments or communities;  
(2)  Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency;  
(3)  Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  
(4)  Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s 
priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the Agency has determined that this 
proposed rule is an economically significant regulatory action because it may have an annual 
  6-2 
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, as defined under part 3(f)(1) of the Order.  
Findings of the regulatory cost analysis (Chapter 3) indicate that the rule, as proposed, is 
projected to result in aggregate annual compliance costs of approximately $210 million under the 
Preferred Option, $520 million under Alternative 1, and $130 million under Alternative 2.  
Separately, this analysis concludes that the proposed rule is expected to have cost savings related 
to avoided costs of $300 million to $740 million under the Preferred Option, $310 million to 
$770 million under Alternative 1, and $110 million to $590 million under Alternative 2, but for 
the purposes of addressing Executive Order 12866, these cost savings are considered to be 
separate impacts rather than direct reductions in the total cost of the rule.    
6.2 Unfunded Mandates Analysis 
Signed into law on March 22, 1995, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) calls 
on all federal agencies to provide a statement supporting the need to issue any regulation 
containing an unfunded federal mandate and describing prior consultation with representatives of 
affected state, local, and tribal governments.   
The proposed rule is subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of UMRA.  In 
general, a rule is subject to the requirements of these sections if it contains “Federal mandates” 
that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by 
the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. The proposed rule results in 
approximately $180 million of costs to the private sector under the Preferred Option, $350 
million under Alternative 1, and $120 million under Alternative 2  in expenditures for the private 
sector and is thus subject to the following requirements of these sections.1 
• An identification of the provision of Federal law under which the proposed rule is 
being promulgated. 
 
• A qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of 
the Federal mandate; 
 
o Costs and benefits to State, local, and tribal governments and the private 
sector 
o Effect on health, safety, and the natural environment 
o Analysis of extent to which such costs may be paid with Federal financial 
assistance (or otherwise paid for by the Federal government)

6.3 Federalism Analysis 
Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires 
EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by state and local 
officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.”  “Policies 
that have federalism implications” is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that 
have “substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government 
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government.”  EPA typically considers a policy to have federalism implications if it results in the 
expenditure by State and/or local governments in the aggregate of $25 million or more in any 
one year. 
Under Executive Order 13132, EPA may not issue a regulation that has federalism 
implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs, and that is not required by statute, 
unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs 
incurred by State and local governments, or EPA consults with State and local officials early in 
the process of developing the regulation. 
Exhibit 6-2 summarizes annual government costs. Direct compliance costs for local and 
State governments reflect average costs per UST system; the analysis assumes that states 
collectively own one percent of total UST systems (6,114), and local governments own 24,458 
UST systems (four percent).   
  6-4 
In addition, under the proposed rule, each state will incur labor costs for reading the new 
regulations, applying for State Program Approval (SPA), and processing one-time notification of 
existence for EGTs, AHFDSs, and FCTs.  States that do not already require notification of UST 
ownership change will also incur costs to process and review all ownership change notifications 
of UST system ownership change.  
In this scenario, total costs to all affected state and local governments (including direct 
compliance costs, notification costs, and state program costs) are approximately $9.3 million 
under the Preferred Option, $19 million under Alternative 1, and $6.5 million under Alternative 
2 in 2008 dollars; this is not considered to be a substantial compliance cost under federalism 
requirements.

6.4 Tribal Governments Analysis 
 Executive Order 13175, entitled “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments” (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), requires EPA to develop an accountable 
process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of 
regulatory policies that have tribal implications.”  EPA has concluded that this action will have 
tribal implications to the extent that tribally-owned entities with UST systems on Indian country 
would be affected.  However, it will neither impose substantial direct compliance costs on tribal 
governments, nor preempt Tribal law.      
 The data sources for the Indian country analysis are the same as those used in the small 
business analysis.  Based on a review of information available about the types of business 
entities in Indian country, it is assumed that UST systems in Indian country represent a subset of 
the rest of the universe and are distributed similarly across the same sectors.2 The total number 
of UST systems in Indian country is distributed proportionally among the NAICS sectors.  
 The cost per UST system is higher in Indian country, as the universe is smaller, and all 
UST systems are assumed to incur costs associated with all the requirements of the proposed 
rule.  At a 2008 cost of $795 per UST system, the total cost for UST systems in Indian country is 
                                                          
2 For more detail, see Industrial Economics, Inc., "Detailed Assessment of UST Universe by Tank Purpose 
and Design," WA 1-25, Task 6, March 24, 2009.  Note that because tribal ownership and operation is defined 
differently than other types of government ownership, no attempts are made to isolate or identify “government” 
UST systems in Indian country. 
  6-5 
approximately $2.1 million. EPA data indicates that 35 percent of all UST systems in Indian 
country are tribally-owned; correspondingly, the total cost to owners and operators of tribally-
owned UST systems is $0.7 million.  
 EPA consulted with tribal officials early in the process of developing this regulation to 
permit them to have meaningful and timely input into its development.  EPA began its 
consultation with tribes on possible changes to the UST regulations shortly after the passage of 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct).  EPAct directed EPA to coordinate with tribes to 
develop and implement an UST program strategy in Indian country to supplement the program’s 
existing approach.  EPA and the tribes worked collaboratively to develop this tribal strategy. 
 EPAct also included key provisions that apply to states receiving federal funding but the 
Act did not specify Indian country. Nonetheless, EPA’s goal is to implement the objectives of 
these provisions in Indian country as an important step in achieving more consistent program 
results in release prevention. Both EPA and tribes recognize the importance of having policies 
that can help to ensure parity in program implementation between states and in Indian country.  
EPA committed to the tribes that we would fully implement the new provisions of the EPAct, 
and the proposed regulations will realize that commitment. 
 In addition to our early consultation with the tribes, EPA also reached out again to the 
tribes as we started the official regulatory process and throughout the development of these 
proposed regulations.  EPA sent letters to leaders of over 500 tribes as well as to tribal regulatory 
staff to invite their participation in the development of the regulations.  EPA heard from both 
tribal officials who work as regulators as well as representatives of owners and operators of UST 
systems in Indian country.  The tribal regulators raised concerns about ensuring parity of 
environmental protection between states and Indian country. 
 The proposed changes to the UST regulations are needed to ensure parity between sites in 
states and in Indian country.  These regulations are also needed to ensure equipment is not just 
installed but is working properly to protect the environment from potential releases. 
6.5 Joint Impacts of Rules 
 Executive Order 12866 requires that the Agency review whether the proposed rule 
creates “a serious inconsistency” or otherwise interferes “with an action taken or planned by 
another agency.”  We do not believe that the proposed rule creates a serious inconsistency or 
interferes with any other actions planned or undertaken by other agencies.  The following are the 
existing regulations that currently affect UST systems:  
 
• State UST Regulations:  A number of states have existing UST regulations that 
are more demanding than existing regulations under 40 CFR Part 280.  To the 
extent that these policies are at least as demanding as the regulations under 
consideration, the systems in these states may already be in partial or full 
compliance with portions of the proposed rule.   Chapter 2 identifies the number 
of UST systems in states with existing (baseline) regulations; cost estimates in 
Chapter 3 reflect the state regulatory programs that exist in the baseline.   
 
  6-6 
• SPCC Regulations:  Currently, a subset of UST systems in the universe is 
regulated by Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rules (SPCC); these 
include emergency generator tanks, airport hydrant fuel distribution systems and 
UST systems with field-constructed tanks. Specifically, SPCC rules in 40 CFR 
Part 112 apply to above-ground containers and completely buried tanks that are 
not otherwise covered by the regulations of 40 CFR Part 280. SPCC rules do not 
specify particular leak detection protocols, but require that plans conform to 
industry standards, which can often be consistent with the requirements of the 
proposed rule.  To the extent that the requirements imposed on these UST systems 
via the proposed rule are more or less stringent than the SPCC rules currently 
governing them, the proposed rule may cause an increase or a reduction in overall 
inspection and monitoring requirements (and costs) for these UST systems.  To 
account for this, EPA has generated baseline assumptions for these systems using 
information from the Department of Defense (the owner of the majority of all 
FCTs and AHFDSs).  EGTs are assumed to incur all incremental costs beyond 
state regulatory baseline costs; to the extent that these systems are regulated under 
SPCC, this may overstate costs. 
  7-1 
Chapter 7.  Comparison of Costs, Benefits, and Other Impacts 
This chapter provides several analyses that compare the costs and beneficial impacts of 
the proposed rule.  Cost-benefit analysis is a central feature of virtually all economic assessments 
and evaluates the economic efficiency of environmental policies by measuring their costs and 
benefits, and hence their net impacts on society.  From an economic viewpoint, the proposed rule 
would enhance economic efficiency if beneficial impacts exceed costs.   
A traditional cost-benefit comparison weighs society’s willingness to pay for the benefits 
of a regulation against the opportunity costs of the rule. Analyses of this type typically do not 
consider distributional issues, although they can be adapted to do so. Adherence to a strict 
benefit-cost approach provides an incomplete assessment of the effects of this proposed rule for 
two reasons: 
• The majority of positive effects from new requirements occur as avoided 
remediation costs, not social benefits such as improved water quality.  
Monetizable social benefits occur only in the form of avoided cancer cases and 
constitute only a very small part of overall effects. Nevertheless, as discussed in 
Chapter 4, avoided costs provide a reasonable measure of the positive effects of 
the proposed rule. 
• A key effect of the proposed rule is to reallocate costs from the public to 
responsible parties. This is likely to improve behavioral incentives, as the parties 
most likely to cause releases will also be responsible for preventing them. As we 
discussed in Chapter 5, savings to state financial assurance funds could exceed 
$150 million per year. 
 While this chapter presents a comparison of costs and benefits, the principal comparison 
is between avoided remediation costs and the cost of the proposed rule. This chapter uses two 
approaches to assess the effectiveness of the proposed requirements.  First, we compare the 
compliance costs of the proposed rule with its total monetized avoided costs and benefits.  We 
then consider cost-effectiveness measures which provide estimates of expenditures per unit 
reduction of releases and estimates of the cost per unit of benefit achieved by the proposed rule.   
Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, however, should not be the only tools used 
in the establishment of any final regulatory action.  The proposed rule is expected to provide 
other benefits that are not expressed in monetary terms.  When these benefits are taken into 
account, along with equity-enhancing effects such as reduction in demand for publicly-funded 
remediation, the benefit-cost comparison becomes more complex.  Consequently, the final 
regulatory decision becomes a policy judgment that takes into account efficiency as well as 
equity concerns. 
In addition, the selection of a discount rate for estimating the present value of future costs 
and benefits is a complex issue.  To reflect a range of possible future costs and benefits, we 
present two estimates of discounted costs and benefits; one based on a seven percent discount 
rate, and one based on a three percent discount rate. 
  7-2 
7.1  Cost Benefit Comparison 
In this section, we compare the total costs of the rule with its total monetized and non-
monetized benefits and avoided costs.  The total costs and monetized avoided costs of the 
proposed rule are summarized in Exhibit 7-1.  The costs in the exhibit represent the compliance 
costs of the proposed rule, including state government administrative costs.   
The exhibit also shows the social benefits of the proposed requirements that are not 
captured in avoided costs. Monetized social benefits are calculated only for avoided cancer risks 
related to benzene due to the difficulty in measuring other types of benefits. Avoided cancer risks 
are estimated to be minimal, as they address only the uncontrolled human health risks that occur 
before discovery and remediation of a release under existing programs. EPA estimates less than 
$5,000 in measurable, monetized social benefits per year, regardless of the option. However, as 
Exhibit 7-1 notes and discussed in Chapter 4, a number of benefits could not be monetized, 
including groundwater protection, mitigation and avoidance of acute events, ecological benefits, 
and non-benzene human health risks. 
Exhibit 7-1 demonstrates that the proposed rule may avoid more costs than it creates, 
potentially generating cost savings to society. EPA estimates that the Preferred Option could 
generate $90 million to $530 million per year in savings to society. Alternative 1 could have a 
net benefit of $250 million to a net cost of $210 million, while Alternative 2 could generate 
savings of $460 million to costs of $20 million.

7.1.1 Cost-Benefit Comparison under the Alternative Baseline Scenario 
Exhibit 7-2 depicts the comparison of costs and benefits of the proposed rule in the 
alternative baseline scenario, where the universes of releases and UST systems decline over time 
in accordance with historical trends. In this alternative baseline, the universe of releases is 
smaller relative to the original baseline than the universe of UST systems; however, Exhibit 7-2 
demonstrates that even in this case, the proposed rule may avoid more costs than it creates, 
potentially generating cost savings to society. EPA estimates that the Preferred Option in the 
alternative baseline could generate between $240 million per year in savings to $20 million per 
year in costs to society. Alternative 1 could have a net cost of $50 million to $330 million, while 
Alternative 2 could generate savings of $240 million to costs of $56 million.

7.2 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
We measure cost-effectiveness by considering the expected cost per release avoided.  
This cost-effectiveness measure is useful for comparing the resources required to eliminate a 
single release under each alternative. For the purpose of this analysis, we consider avoided 
releases to be both releases altogether avoided and groundwater incidents averted due to the 
proposed rule. As presented in Exhibit 7-3, we find that the cost per release avoided is 
approximately $38,000 to $120,000 under the Preferred Option, compared with $90,000 to 
$290,000 under Alternative 1 and $33,000 to $200,000 under Alternative 2. This compares 
favorably with average release remediation costs presented in Exhibit 4-2 in Chapter 4, which 
range between $92,000 and $194,000. This regulatory impact analysis suggests that, in addition 
to improving the alignment of incentives, release prevention is likely to be less costly than 
release remediation under the Preferred Option and Alternative 2 and in some instances under 
Alternative 1.

b Compliance cost includes direct compliance costs and state oversight costs.  For this regulatory impact analysis, direct 
compliance costs and state oversight costs provide a reasonable proxy to assess the proposed rule’s social costs.  See Chapter 
3.1 for further discussion.   
 
7.3 Costs and Beneficial Effects Under Alternative Discount Rates 
The selection of the rate at which to discount future costs and benefits is complex. To 
assess the sensitivity of our results to our choice of discount rate, Exhibit 7-4 presents a 
summary of total compliance costs and avoided remediation costs considering alternate discount 
rates of three percent and zero percent (i.e., no discounting).  Costs change little because a 
reduction in interest rates both reduces time value of money (TVM) costs and increases costs that 
have a delay before implementation.1,2  The net result of a change from a discount rate of seven 
                                                          
1 When amortizing a value over time, if all other factors are held constant, a reduction in the rate of interest 
decreases the annual payment. 
2 The rate of discount enters into our calculation of time value of money costs. Higher discount rates 
increase these costs, while lower discount rates cause them to decrease. See Appendix D for details. 
  7-6 
percent to a discount rate of zero percent is an overall increase in the cost of the rule of less than 
$10 million per year, indicating that TVM and delayed-implementation cost effects essentially 
offset each other.  
Discount rates are also involved in our estimate of annual avoided costs. In particular, we 
use them only to obtain constant annual avoided costs for those requirements in which the 
affected universe grows over time and calculate the delay until positive impacts accrue.3 Here, 
the effect of lowering interest rate is more significant, as all requirements are discounted by at 
least one period. As Exhibit 7-4 shows, a change in the rate of discount from seven percent to 
zero percent increases avoided costs from a range of $300 million - $740 million to $340 million 
- $810 million. This increase is largely due to the fact that we discount all avoided costs by at 
least one year, as outlined in Exhibit 1-2. 
We conclude that, while a reduction in the discount rate leaves annual compliance costs 
essentially unchanged at $210 million, avoided costs increase from by $40 million to $70 million 
per year. As such, annual savings to society would increase from a range of $90 million - $530 
million to $130 million - $600 million if EPA relies on a zero rate of discount.
