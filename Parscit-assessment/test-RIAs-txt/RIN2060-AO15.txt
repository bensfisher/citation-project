SECTION 1  
INTRODUCTION 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the 
current National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Portland 
cement manufacturing industry. The proposed amendments add or revise, as applicable, emission 
limits for mercury, total hydrocarbons, hydrogen chloride, and particulate matter from kilns and 
in-line/raw mills located at a major or area sources. The proposed amendments also remove the 
operating limit for the average hourly recycle rate for cement kiln dust and remove the work 
practice requirement for using certain mercury-containing fly ash in cement kilns. EPA 
developed these proposed amendments in response to the notice of reconsideration published on 
December 20, 2006, and other requirements. As part of the regulatory process of preparing these 
amendments, EPA is required to develop a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). This RIA includes 
an economic impact analysis (EIA) and a small entity impacts analysis. This report documents 
the RIA methods and results.  
1.1 Executive Summary 
The key results of the RIA are as follows: 
 Engineering Cost Analysis: EPA estimates total annualized costs with the NESHAP 
will be $368 million (2005$). 
 Market Analysis: The partial-equilibrium economic model suggests the average 
national price for Portland cement could be 4% higher with the NESHAP, or $3.30 
per metric ton, while annual domestic production may fall by 8%, or 7 million tons 
per year. Because of higher domestic prices, imports rise by 2 million metric tons per 
year.  
 Industry Analysis: As domestic production falls, cement industry revenues are 
projected to decline by 4%, or $341 million. Overall, net production costs also fall by 
$137 million with compliance cost increases ($235 million) offset by cost reductions 
associated with lower cement production. Operating profits fall by $204 million, or 
16%. Other consequences include reduced demand for labor. Employment falls by 
approximately 8%, or 1,167 employees. EPA identified six domestic plants with 
negative operating profits and significant utilization changes that could temporarily 
idle until market demand conditions improve. The plants are small capacity plants 
with unit compliance costs close to $5 per ton and $50 million total change in 
operating profits. Since these plants account for approximately 2.5% of domestic 
capacity, a decision to permanently shut down these plants would reduce domestic 
supply and lead to additional projected market price increases.  
 Social Cost Analysis: The estimated social cost of the proposed amendments is $605 
million (2005$). This estimate includes: the results for existing kilns included in the 
partial-equilibrium analysis ($606 million surplus loss in domestic surplus and $89 
 1-2 
million surplus gain for other countries producing cement); the direct compliance 
costs for white cement kilns ($2 million); and the direct compliance costs for 20 
additional kilns projected to come on line in 2013 ($86 million). The social cost 
estimates are significantly higher than the engineering analysis estimates, which 
estimated annualized costs of $368 million. This is a direct consequence of EPA’s 
assumptions about existing domestic plants’ pricing behavior discussed extensively in 
previous cement industry rulemakings, Section 2, Appendix A, and Appendix B of 
this RIA. Under baseline conditions without regulation, the existing domestic cement 
plants are assumed to choose a production level that is less than the level produced 
under perfect competition. As a result, a preexisting market distortion exists in the 
markets covered by the proposed rule (i.e., the observed baseline market price is 
higher than the [unobserved] market price that a model of perfect competition would 
predict). The imposition of additional regulatory costs tends to widen the gap between 
price and marginal cost in these markets and contributes to additional social costs.  
 Energy Impacts: EPA concludes that the rule when implemented will not have a 
significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The cement 
industry accounts for less than 0.3% of the U.S. total energy consumption. Although 
EPA estimates the additional add-on controls may increase electricity consumption by 
926 million kWh, this is less than 0.1% of the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2009 
(Department of Energy [DOE], 2008) 2013 electricity forecasts of total electricity use 
(4,091 billion kWh). 
 Small Business Analysis: EPA performed a screening analysis for impacts on small 
entities by comparing compliance costs to average company revenues. EPA’s analysis 
found that the ratio of compliance cost to company revenue falls below 1% for one of 
the four small entities included in the screening analysis. Two small entities 
(including a tribal government) would have an annualized cost of between 1% and 
3% of sales. One small business would have an annualized cost greater than 3% of 
sales. In addition to the screening analysis, EPA also examined small entity effects 
after accounting for market adjustments. Under this assumption, the entities recover 
some of the regulatory program costs as the market price adjusts in response to higher 
cement production costs. Even after accounting for these adjustments, small entity 
operating profits fall by $4 million, or 9%. As cement production falls, employment 
may decline by up to 23 employees, a 5% reduction.  
 Benefits Analysis: In the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates the 
benefits of this proposal are $4.4 billion to $11 billion and $4.0 billion to $9.7 billion, 
at 3% and 7% discount rates respectively.1 Annualized domestic social costs are $694 
million at a 7% discount rate as mentioned in Section 4 of this RIA.2 Thus, the net 
benefits (i.e., benefits in 2013 minus annualized costs) are $3.7 billion to $11 billion 
and $3.3 billion to $9.0 billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates respectively. 
                                                 
1 The benefits are discounted to account for the cessation lag in PM2.5 benefits from premature mortality and acute 
myocardial infarctions (AMIs), rather than a discounted stream of future benefits; whereas discounting the costs 
reflects the lifetime costs of the equipment. For this reason, it is appropriate in this context to use two different 
discount rates for the benefits and costs.  
2 The domestic cost does not include the estimated $89 million surplus gain for foreign producers.

SECTION 2  
INDUSTRY PROFILE 
Hydraulic cement (primarily Portland cement) is a key component of an important 
construction material: concrete. Concrete is used in a wide variety of applications (e.g., 
residential and commercial buildings, public works projects), and cement demand is influenced 
by national and regional trends in these sectors. Recent data for 2007 show that the U.S. cement 
industry produced over 90 million metric tons of Portland cement (Department of Interior [DOI], 
U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 2008b). The value of total U.S. sales, including imported 
cement, was about $11.8 billion, with an average value of approximately $100 per metric ton. 
The vast majority of cement sales went to ready-mixed concrete producers and concrete product 
manufacturers (88%). Since 2003, the United States has relied on cement imports to meet 
approximately 20% to 23% of its consumption needs. However, this share dropped to 
approximately 17% in 2007 as overall construction demand for cement fell (DOI, USGS, 2008b). 
The remainder of this section provides an introduction to the Portland cement industry. 
The purpose is to give the reader a general understanding of the technical and economic aspects 
of the industry that must be addressed in the economic impact analysis. Section 2.1 provides an 
overview of the production processes and costs data. Section 2.2 discusses the uses, consumers, 
and substitutes for cement. Section 2.3 summarizes the organization of the Portland cement 
industry. The industry profile concludes with a discussion of historical market data and the 
current industry outlook. 
2.1 The Supply Side 
2.1.1 Production Process 
As shown in Figure 2-1, the manufacturing process of an integrated cement plant includes 
 quarrying and crushing the raw materials, 
 grinding the carefully proportioned materials to a high degree of fineness, 
 firing the raw materials mixture in a rotary kiln to produce clinker, and 
 grinding the resulting clinker to a fine powder and mixing with gypsum to produce 
cement. 
 2-2 
 
Figure 2-1. Simplified Flow Sheet of Clinker and Cement Manufacture 
There are two processes for manufacturing cement: the wet process and the dry process. 
In the wet process, water is added to the raw materials during the blending process and before 
feeding the mixture into the rotary kiln. In contrast, the dry process feeds the blended materials 
directly into the rotary kiln in a dry state. Newer dry process plants also use preheater and 
precalciner technologies that partially heat and calcine the blended raw materials before they 
enter the rotary kiln. These technologies can increase the overall energy efficiency of the cement 
plant and reduce production costs.  
The fuel efficiency differences between the wet and dry processes have led to a 
substantial decline in clinker capacity provided by the wet process over the last 3 decades. 
Historical data show capacity shares falling from 52% in 1980 to approximately 22% in 2000 
(Van Oss and Padovani, 2002). Data also show that the number of wet process plants fell from 
32 in 2000 to 23 in 2005 (Van Oss and Padovani, 2002; DOI, USGS, 2007). 
 2-3 
2.1.2 Types of Portland Cement 
Portland cement manufacturers produce a variety of types of cement in the United States 
designed to meet different requirements. The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) 
specification C-150 provides for eight types of Portland cement: five standard types (I, II, III, IV, 
V) and three additional types that include air-entraining properties (IA, IIA, IIIA) (PCA, 2008a). 
We describe these below. 
Types I and IA: These types are the usual product used in general concrete construction, 
most commonly known as gray cement because of its color.  
Types II and IIA: These types are intended for use when moderate heat of hydration is 
required or for general concrete construction exposed to moderate sulfate action. 
Type III and IIIA: These types are made from raw materials with a lime-to-silica ratio 
higher than that of Type I cement and are ground finer than Type I cements. They contain a 
higher proportion of tricalcium silicate than regular Portland cements. 
Type IV: This type contains a lower percentage of tricalcium silicate and tricalcium 
aluminate than Type I, thus lowering the heat evolution. Consequently, the percentage of 
tetracalcium aluminoferrite is increased. Type IV cements are produced to attain a low heat of 
hydration. 
Type V: This type resists sulfates better than the other four types. 
As shown in Table 2-1, the vast majority of Portland cement shipments1 in 2005 were 
Types I and II grey cement. However, Type V (sulfate-resisting) is a growing market (DOI, 
USGS, 2007a); since 2000, Type V cement has increased its share of shipments from 4% to 
15%. Shipment shares for other types of cement remained constant during this period. 
2.1.3 Production Costs 
Portland cement is produced using a combination of variable inputs such as raw 
materials, labor, electricity, and fuel. U.S. Census data for the cement industry (North American 
Industry Classification System [NAICS] 32731: cement manufacturing) provides an initial 
overview of aggregated industry expenditures on these inputs (Department of Commerce [DOC], 
Bureau of the Census, 2008). In 2006, the total value of shipments was $10.7 billion, and the 
industry spent approximately $2.1 billion on materials, parts, and packaging, or 20% of the value 
of shipments. Total compensation for all employees (includes payroll and fringe benefits)  
                                                 
1 USGS notes these shipment data include cement imports (primarily Types I, II, and V).

Amounted to $1.3 billion (12%).1 Fuels and electricity expenditures were approximately $1.6 
billion (15%). 
2.1.3.1 Raw Material Costs 
According to the USGS, approximately 159.7 million tons of raw materials were required 
to produce approximately 95.5 million tons of cement in 2005 or 1.67 tons of raw materials per 
ton of cement. Table 2-2 summarizes the amount of raw material inputs used per ton of cement 
produced in the United States between 2000 and 2005. As the data show, the amount of raw 
materials required to produce one ton of cement has remained essentially constant during this 
6-year period.  
                                                 
1 Wages paid to production workers were $0.7 billion (6% of the value of shipments) at an average hourly rate of 
$25.

The price of these raw materials varies across regions. Table 2-3 lists the average price of 
raw materials per metric ton by state. In 2005, the prices of raw materials were highest in Hawaii 
where they sold for an average of $13.34 per metric ton. The prices of raw materials were lowest 
in Michigan, where they sold for an average of $3.89 per metric ton. 
2.1.3.2 Labor Costs 
In 2005, the Portland Cement Association (PCA) reported labor productivity measures (in 
terms of metric tons of cement per employee hour)1 for 2000 to 2005 in its U.S. and Canadian 
Labor-Energy Input Survey. Using these data, we computed a measure of labor hour 
requirements to produce cement (see Table 2-4). As these data show, wet process plants are 
typically more labor intensive, requiring approximately 45% more labor hours to produce a 
metric ton of cement than dry process plants. 
In addition, labor productivity has been improving more quickly in dry process plants 
than in those using a wet manufacturing process. Between 2000 and 2005, labor requirements 
decreased by 15% in dry process plants, while in wet process plants labor requirements remained 
constant. As a result, the wet process labor costs relative to dry process plants labor costs have 
risen in recent years (Figure 2-2).2 
                                                 
1 Throughout this report, we use PCA’s method to calculate labor and energy efficiency. This measure is a weighted 
sum of clinker and finished cement production. Weights for labor are 85% clinker and 15% finished cement 
production. Weights for energy are 92% clinker and 8% finished cement production (PCA, 2005). 
2 The labor costs reported in Figure 2-3 were calculated by first multiplying the number of employee hours per 
metric ton of cement reported in Table 2-4 by the average hourly earnings of production workers for each year 
(BLS, 2007). Next, these cost estimates were adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2005 dollars by using the 
consumer price index (CPI) (DOC, BLS, 2008).

2.1.3.3 Energy Costs 
Figure 2-3 provides a detailed breakdown of U.S. energy consumption in 2005. As this 
figure shows, the vast majority of energy in U.S. cement plants is derived from coal and coke 
(75%). The remaining 25% of energy consumption is derived from electricity, waste, natural gas, 
and petroleum products.  
PCA also reported energy consumption data by type of U.S. cement plant (in terms of 
millions of BTUs per metric ton of cement) (see Table 2-5). As these data show, wet process 
plants are typically more energy intensive, consuming approximately 44% more energy per ton 
of cement than dry process plants. In addition, the trends in energy consumption continue to 
show that dry plants have become more energy efficient than wet process plants. Between 2000 
and 2005, energy consumption per ton of cement in dry process plants decreased by 5%; in 
contrast, wet process plants’ energy consumption increased slightly during this period.

2.2 The Demand Side 
The demand for Portland cement is considered a “derived” demand because it depends on 
the construction demands for its end product—concrete. A recent study by the U.S. International 
Trade Commission suggests that 0.192 metric tons of grey Portland cement were used per $1,000 
of construction in 1998 (USITC, 2006). Given cement prices at this time (approximately $75 per 
metric ton), Portland cement costs represented only a small share of the total value of 
construction expenditures (less than 2%). 
Concrete is used in a wide variety of construction applications, including residential and 
commercial buildings, and public works projects such as the national highway system. As shown 
in Figure 2-4, ready-mixed concrete producers have historically accounted for over half of the 
Portland cement consumption. Although government and miscellaneous expenditures saw 
substantial increases in the early 1990s, their consumption share returned to pre-1990s levels 
after 1996. The latest USGS use data show that ready-mixed concrete producers accounted for

74% of cement sales in 2005, followed by concrete product manufacturers (14%), contractors 
(6%), and other (6%) (Kelly and Matos, 2007a). 
Cement competes with other construction materials such as steel, asphalt, and lumber. 
Lumber is the primary substitute in the residential construction market, while steel is the primary 
substitute in commercial applications. Asphalt is a key substitute in transportation projects such 
as road and parking lot surfacing. However, concrete has advantages over these substitutes 
because it tends to be available locally and has lower long-term maintenance costs (Van Oss and 
Padovani, 2002).  
The PCA regularly reports price trends for these competing building materials (PCA, 
2008b). As shown in Figure 2-5, steel and asphalt have risen sharply relative to cement since 
2003 while lumber has declined.

2.3 Industry Organization 
2.3.1 Market Structure 
A review and description of market characteristics (i.e., degree of concentration, entry 
barriers, and product differentiation) can enhance our understanding of how U.S. cement markets 
operate. These characteristics provide indicators of a firm’s ability to influence market prices by 
varying the quantity of cement it sells. For example, in markets with large numbers of sellers and 
identical products, firms are unlikely to be able to influence market prices via their production 
decisions (i.e., they are “price takers”). However, in markets with few firms, significant barriers 
to entry (e.g., licenses, legal restrictions, or high fixed costs), or products that are similar but can 
be differentiated, the firm may have some degree of market power (i.e., set or significantly 
influence market prices). 
Cement sales are often concentrated locally among a small number of firms for two 
reasons: high transportation costs and production economies of scale.1 Transportation costs 
significantly influence where cement is ultimately sold; high transportation costs relative to unit 
value provide incentives to produce and sell cement locally in regional markets (USITC, 2006). 
                                                 
1 The 2002 Economic Census reports that the national Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for cement (North 
American Industry Classification System [NAICS] 32731) is 568. However, this measure is likely not 
representative of actual concentration that exists in regional markets. 
 2-11 
To support this claim, the empirical literature has typically pointed to Census of Transportation 
data showing over 80% of cement shipments were made within a 200-mile radius (Jans and 
Rosenbaum, 1997)1 and reported evidence of high transportation costs per dollar of product value 
from case studies (Ryan, 2006). The cement industry is also very capital intensive and entry 
requires substantial investments. In additional, large plants are typically more economical 
because they can produce cement at lower unit costs; this reduces entry incentives for small-
sized cement plants. Using recent data for planned capacity expansions between 2008 and 2012, 
the PCA reports these expansions will cost $5.9 billion and add 25 million metric tons (PCA, 
2007), or $240 per metric ton, of new capacity.  
For a given construction application, consumers are likely to view cement produced by 
different firms as very good substitutes. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
specifications tend to ensure uniform quality, and recent industry reviews (USITC, 2006) suggest 
that there is little or no brand loyalty that allows firms to differentiate their products. 
2.3.2 Manufacturing Plants 
During 2005, 107 cement manufacturing plants with 186 cement kilns were operating in 
the United States. This section describes the location, age, production capacity, and employment 
of these manufacturing facilities. Section 2.3.2 concludes with a discussion of future trends. 
Section 2.3.3 provides a detailed discussion of the characteristics of the firms owning these 
facilities.  
2.3.2.1 Location  
Table 2-6 summarizes the geographic location of cement kilns in the United States and 
clinker capacity. The top five states in order of clinker capacity are California, Texas, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama. Together these states account for 75 (40%) of the kilns in 
the United States and 41 million metric tons (44%) of clinker capacity. Figure 2-6 provides a 
graphical depiction of the number of kilns distributed by state.  
Fourteen states (Alaska, Hawaii, Connecticut, Louisiana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, 
Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Minnesota, North Carolina, and 
Vermont) and the District of Columbia had no clinker-producing facilities in 2005.  
                                                 
1 A recent USITC study of California cement markets found more than 75% of gray Portland cement shipments in 
the state were shipped to customers within 200 miles of the cement producer (USITC, 2006).

2.3.2.2 Age 
In 2005, 72% (134) of all kilns in the United States used the dry manufacturing process, 
and it accounted for 83% (78 million metric tons) of national clinker capacity. The growing 
prevalence of the dry process among cement manufacturers is part of a long-term trend. As the 
data in Table 2-7 indicate, no new wet clinker capacity has been added within the past 30 years.

All 68 kilns that have become operational within the past 30 years use the dry manufacturing 
process. These new kilns account for 64% (60 million metric tons) of national clinker capacity. 
2.3.2.3 Production Capacity and Utilization 
Between 2000 and 2005, apparent annual clinker capacity grew approximately 17%, 
while clinker production grew by approximately 14% (Table 2-8). Because capacity tends to 
grow more rapidly than production, total capacity utilization decreased slightly in this period 
from 87.5% in 2000 to 85.4% in 2005.

commodity/cement/>. As obtained on March 14, 2008. 
Much of the vast majority of the growth in clinker capacity came in 2001 when existing 
Portland cement plants completed major capacity upgrade projects, resulting in a 12% increase in 
clinker capacity over the previous year (USGS, 2002). As a result, capacity utilization fell to 
79.7% that year. After 2001, clinker capacity grew an average of 1% each year, while production 
grew an average of 2%. As a result, capacity utilization has risen slowly since 2001. However, 
 2-16 
throughout these movements in clinker capacity and production, capacity utilization tended to 
remain between 80% and 85%. 
Capacity utilization often varies by geographic region as a result of fluctuations in 
regional construction activity. For example, 2005 data show that Idaho, Montana, and Nevada 
shared a capacity utilization rate of 95.5%—well above the national average. In contrast, South 
Carolina used only 64.5% of its clinker capacity. Table 2-9 provides a complete listing of 
capacity utilization rates by state in 2005. 
2.3.2.4 Employment 
Each year, the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) collects employment, payroll, 
sales, and other data for all manufacturing establishments. Table 2-10 summarizes the 
employment data collected by the ASM for the cement manufacturing industry (NAICS 327310) 
from 2000 to 2005. As these data indicate, total employment fell approximately 2% over this 
6-year period, from approximately 17,000 employees in 2000 to 16,900 in 2005.  
2.3.2.5 Trends 
As previously discussed, clinker capacity has been increasing at a slower pace since 
2001. However, according to the PCA, the cement industry has announced that it will increase 
clinker capacity by nearly 25 million metric tons between 2007 and 2012. This represents a 27% 
increase over U.S. 2006 clinker capacity and amounts to a $5.9 billion investment (PCA, 2007).  
In addition to these expected capacity expansions, likely changes in U.S. specifications 
allowing the use of limestone in Portland cement could also increase production capacity. 
According to the PCA, domestic cement supply could increase by as much as 2 million 
additional tons by 2012. Increases in EPA production variances could also add another 1.1 
million metric tons of domestic supply (PCA, 2007). 
2.3.3 Firm Characteristics 
EPA has reviewed industry information and publicly available sales and employment 
databases to identify the chain of ownership by accounting for subsidiaries, divisions, and joint 
ventures to appropriately group companies by size. Table 2-11 provides sales and employment 
data for 27 ultimate parent companies operating Portland cement manufacturing plants in 2005.

2.3.3.1 Distribution of Small and Large Companies 
Firms are grouped into small and large categories using Small Business Administration 
(SBA) general size standard definitions for NAICS codes. These size standards are presented 
either by number of employees or by annual receipt levels, depending on the NAICS code. The 
manufacture of Portland cement is covered by NAICS code 327310 for cement manufacturing. 
Thus, according to SBA size standards, firms owning Portland cement manufacturing plants are 
categorized as small if the total number of employees at the firm is less than 750; otherwise, the 
firm is classified as large. As shown in Table 2-11, potentially affected firms range in size from 
160 to 71,000 employees. A total of 4 firms, or 15%, are categorized as small, while the 
remaining 23 firms, or 75%, are large.1 
2.3.3.2 Capacity Share 
As shown in Table 2-11, the leading companies in terms of capacity at the end of 2005 
were Holcim (U.S.) Inc.; CEMEX, Inc.; Lafarge North America, Inc.; Buzzi Unicem USA, Inc.; 
HeidelbergCement AG (owner of Lehigh Cement Co.); Ash Grove Cement Co.; Texas 
Industries, Inc.; Italcementi S.p.A.; Taiheiyo Cement Corporation; Titan Cement; and VICAT. 
The top 5 had about 57% of total U.S. clinker capacity, and the top 10 accounted for 83% of total 
capacity. Small companies accounted for less than 5% of clinker capacity.

2.3.3.3 Company Revenue and Ownership Type 
Cement manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry. The vast majority of stakeholders 
are large global companies with sales exceeding $1 billion. In 2005, ultimate parent company 
sales ranged from $30 million to $22.3 billion (Table 2-11), with average (median) sales of 
$4,565 ($1,589) million. Small companies accounted for 0.3% share by sales. Ultimate parent 
companies were either privately or publicly owned or jointly operated by several companies. A 
majority of the companies (52%) were publicly owned. Private companies had a slightly smaller 
share (41%), and only two (or 7%) were joint ventures. 
2.4 Markets 
Portland cement is produced and consumed domestically as well as traded internationally. 
The United States meets a substantial fraction of its cement needs through imports; in contrast, it 
exports only a small fraction of domestically produced cement to other countries. We provide 
value, quantity, and price trends over the past decade for Portland cement when detailed statistics 
 2-21 
are available. In the case of international trade, we can report data only for hydraulic cement, 
which includes Portland and masonry cement. 
2.4.1 Market Volumes  
2.4.1.1 Domestic Production  
In 2007, the domestic shipments of Portland cement were 90.6 million metric tons, 
reflecting an 8.5% increase from 2000 and, more recently, a 3% decrease from 2006 (see 
Table 2-12). Year-end stocks remained relatively level during this period at 7.4 million metric 
tons. Stocks fell slightly by 5% since 2006 and equaled 8.9 million tons in 2007. As Table 2-12 
shows, shipments to final customers increased steadily since 2000, reaching 128 million tons in 
2006. However, affected by declines in the housing market, the shipments fell by 9% in 2007.

2.4.1.2 International Trade 
Cement imports are a significant share of domestic consumption (approximately 20%); 
they also grew by 30% from 2000 to 2006 (see Table 2-13). Major importing countries in 2007 
included Canada (18% of total imports in 2006), China (16%), and Thailand (11%) (DOI, USGS, 
2008b). In 2007, the falling value of the dollar and construction activity declines in the housing 
market tempered the quantity of import demanded. As a result, the share of U.S. consumption 
met by imports fell to its lowest level in 10 years.

During the period from 2000 to 2005, U.S. exports remained relatively constant at about 
800,000 tons and typically did not exceed 1% of production. However, the level of U.S. exports 
has increased during the last 2 years. In 2007, U.S. exports totaled 1.9 million metric tons. The 
vast majority of U.S. exports of hydraulic cement are supplied to Canada: U.S. producers 
shipped a total of 650,000 tons to Canada in 2005, or 85% of total U.S. exports. The remaining 
fraction of U.S. exports in 2005 went to the Bahamas, Mexico, and 33 other countries around the 
world (DOI, USGS, 2008b). 
2.4.2 Market Prices 
Correcting for the effects of inflation, we find that the real price of cement per metric ton 
(2005 dollars) has typically ranged between $75 and $95 since 1990 (see Figure 2-7). However, 
data for the last 2 years suggest the average price of cement is at its highest level in over 2 
decades (approximately $100). Because of transportation constraints, there are regional 
differences in the price of cement across states. For example, remote locations such as Alaska 
and Hawaii had the highest deviation from the national average ($48 in 2005) (see Figure 2-8). 
In the contiguous states, prices in Arizona, New Mexico, and California were higher than the 
national averages, while prices in Texas, Indiana, and South Carolina were among the lowest.  
2.4.3 Future Projections  
Although estimates of future cement demand are not publicly available, the Energy 
Information Administration provides projections for the real value of shipments for the stone, 
clay, and glass industry in its AEO (DOE, 2007). The forecasted annual average growth rate for 
2005 to 2030 is approximately 1.7%.

SECTION 3  
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
EPA prepares an EIA to provide decision makers with a measure of the social costs of 
using resources to comply with a program (EPA, 2000). The social costs can then be compared 
with estimated social benefits (as presented in Section 5). As noted in EPA’s (2000) Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses, several tools are available to estimate social costs and range 
from simple direct compliance cost methods to the development of a more complex market 
analysis that estimates market changes (e.g., price and consumption) and economic welfare 
changes (e.g., changes in consumer and producer surplus).  
The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has adopted the standard 
industry-level analysis described in the Office’s resource manual (EPA, 1999a). This approach is 
consistent with previous EPA analyses of the Portland cement industry (EPA, 1998; EPA, 
1999b) and uses a single-period static partial-equilibrium model to compare prepolicy cement 
market baselines with expected postpolicy outcomes in these markets. The benchmark time 
horizon for the analysis is the intermediate run where producers have some constraints on their 
flexibility to adjust factors of production. This time horizon allows us to capture important 
transitory impacts of the program on existing producers. Key measures in this analysis include 
 market-level effects (market prices, changes in domestic production and 
consumption, and international trade), 
 industry-level effects (changes in revenues, costs, profits, employment), 
 facility-level effects (plant utilization changes), and 
 social costs (changes in producer and consumer surplus). 
3.1 Regulatory Program Costs 
EPA is proposing the new emission limits for mercury, total hydrocarbons (THC), 
particulate matter, and hydrochloric acid. For the year 2013, EPA’s engineering cost analysis 
estimates the total annualized costs of the proposed rule are $368 million (in 2005 dollars) (see 
Table 3-1). These costs include a variety of pollution control expenditures: equipment 
installation, operating and maintenance, recordkeeping, and performance-testing activities. 
Figure 3-1 illustrates the distribution of annualized compliance costs per metric ton of capacity 
for existing grey and white cement kilns.  For analytical convenience, the analysis assumes the

capital costs will take place at the beginning of 2013.  However, costs may actually begin being 
phased in a year or two earlier.1 
3.2 Partial-Equilibrium Analysis for Costs Applying to Existing Kilns 
The partial-equilibrium analysis performed for this rule develops a cement market model 
that simulates how stakeholders (consumers and firms) might respond to the additional 
regulatory program costs. In this section, we provide an overview of the economic model. 
Appendix A provides additional details on the behavioral assumptions, data, parameters, and 
model equations. 
                                                 
1 These costs are actually draft compliance costs. The final compliance cost estimate for this rule are somewhat 
lower, at $317 million; this difference is not expected to have an impact on the results of the market analysis, 
emissions reductions,  or on the expected distribution of social costs among stakeholders.

3.2.1 Regional Structure and Baseline Data 
Cement sales are often concentrated locally among a small number of firms for two 
reasons: high transportation costs and production economies of scale.2 Transportation costs 
significantly influence where cement is ultimately sold; high transportation costs relative to unit 
value provide incentives to produce and sell cement locally in regional markets (USITC, 2006). 
To support this claim, the empirical literature has typically pointed to Census of Transportation 
data showing over 80% of cement shipments were made within a 200-mile radius (Jans and 
Rosenbaum, 1997)3 and reported evidence of high transportation costs per dollar of product value 
from case studies (Ryan, 2006). Based on this literature, the Agency assumes that the U.S. 
Portland cement industry is divided into a number of independent regional markets with each 
having a single market-clearing price. 
                                                 
2 The 2002 Economic Census reports that the national Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for cement—North 
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 32731—is 568. However, this measure is likely not 
representative of actual concentration that exists in regional markets. 
3 A recent USITC study of California cement markets found more than 75% of gray Portland cement shipments in 
the state were shipped to customers within 200 miles of the cement producer (USITC, 2006). 
 3-4 
The need for a complete set of statistics makes the use of a 2005 baseline the best choice; 
it was the latest year for which the PCA had published their plant information summary and 
complete statistics for updating variable cost functions were available. However, EPA recognizes 
that the demand for cement is a derived demand because it is dependent on demand for sectors 
such as housing and construction. As a result, business cycles also influence the cement industry. 
If 2013 is more or less favorable for the cement industry than 2005, then impacts would be 
expected to change accordingly. 
The freight-on-board (f.o.b.) price of Portland cement for each regional market is derived 
as the production weighted average of the state level f.o.b. prices reported by the USGS for 
cement (see Table 3-2). The production of Portland cement within each market is the sum of 
estimated individual kiln production levels (see Appendix A for additional details) (see Table 3-
3). We obtained estimates of Portland cement imports from the USGS and mapped them to each 
market based on the port of entry.

3.2.2 Seller Pricing Behavior 
Once the markets were defined, we examined the evidence supporting the appropriate 
supplier pricing behavior assumptions in these markets. For example, the degree of 
concentration, entry barriers, and product differentiation can indicate a firm’s ability to influence 
market prices by varying the quantity of cement it sells. In markets with large numbers of sellers 
and identical products, firms are unlikely to be able to influence market prices via their 
production decisions (i.e., they are “price takers”). However, in markets with few firms, 
significant barriers to entry (e.g., licenses, legal restrictions, or high fixed costs) or with products 
that are similar but can be differentiated, the firm may have some degree of market power (i.e., 
set or significantly influence market prices). 
Although perfect competition on the supply side (and demand side) is widely accepted 
for modeling many industries (EPA, 2000), the cement industry has unique characteristics that 
lead us to use an alternative assumption about supplier pricing behavior. First, high 
transportation costs and other production economics limit the number of sellers, so each seller 
has a substantial market share. Potential entry is constrained by the high capital costs that involve 
purchases and construction of large rotary kilns that are not readily movable or transferable to 
other uses. In addition, large plants are typically more economical because they can produce 
cement at lower unit costs; this reduces entry incentives for small-sized cement plants. Second, 
cement producers offer very similar or identical products. American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) specifications tend to ensure uniform quality, and recent industry reviews 
(USITC, 2006) suggest that there is little or no brand loyalty that allows firms to differentiate 
their products. Given this evidence, EPA continued to use the oligopoly framework used in 
previous economic analyses (1998, 1999b).  
One consequence of this assumption is that the seller individually chooses an output level 
that is less than the level produced under perfect competition. As a result, the baseline market 
price will be higher than a model of perfect competition, and there is a preexisting market 
distortion in the industry being regulated.4 The size of the existing distortion depends on the 
seller’s market share and how responsive cement consumers are to changes in the cement price. 
Economic theory suggests that in the model EPA selected for this analysis, the market distortion 
                                                 
4 This ultimately influences the partial-equilibrium model’s estimates of the social cost of the regulatory program 
since bigger existing market distortions tend to widen the gap between price and marginal cost in these markets 
and lead to higher deadweight loss estimates than under the case of perfectly competitive markets. The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) explicitly mentions the need to consider market power–related welfare costs in 
evaluating regulations under Executive Order 12866 (EPA, 1999a).

will typically be higher the smaller the number of sellers and in markets where the quantity

3.2.3 Economic Impact Analysis Results 
3.2.3.1 Market-Level Results 
Market-level impacts include the regional price and quantity adjustments for Portland 
cement, including the changes in imports for the appropriate regions. As shown in Table 3-4, the 
average national price for Portland cement increases by 4% higher, or $3.30 per metric ton, while 
domestic production falls by 8%, or 7 million tons per year.

Market Output (106 metric tons) 127 −4 −3.3% 
Domestic production 94 −7 −7.8% 
Imports 33 2 7.1% 
 
As shown in Table 3-5, price increases are the highest in regions with high compliance 
costs per metric ton. For example, the Cincinnati market price increase ($8.00 per metric ton) 
also includes kilns with higher average compliance costs and a kiln with the highest per-unit 
compliance costs ($15.10 per metric ton). 
Imports of Portland cement increase in response to higher domestic cement prices. As 
shown in Table 3-4, imports increase by 7%, or 2 million metric tons. Imports also tend to limit 
price increases in certain regions. Cement plants in these regions have more difficulty passing on 
compliance costs in the form of higher prices when compared with similar plants operating in 
regions without import competition. As shown in Table 3-6, median price increases in regions 
with imports are approximately 17% lower than the median price increases in regions without 
import competition.

3.2.3.2 Industry-Level Results 
As domestic production falls, cement industry revenues are projected to decline by 4%, 
or $341 million (see Table 3-7). Overall, net production costs also fall by $137 million with 
compliance cost increases ($235 million) offset by cost reductions associated with lower cement 
production. Operating profits fall by $204 million, or 16%. Other consequences include reduced 
demand for labor. Employment falls by approximately 8%, or 1,167 employees.

As shown in Table 3-8, compliance costs vary by cement plant, and this variation 
suggests some plants will be more adversely affected than others. To assess these differences, 
EPA collected industry operating profit data and identified plants with operating profit increases 
and losses. Absent plant-specific data, EPA assumed each plant’s baseline profits were consistent 
with the median operating profit margin reported by the PCA (2008c, Table 44). In 2005, this 
value was $18 per metric ton, or 15.7%. Using this assumption, total operating profits for 67 
plants (64%) decrease by $328 million with regulation. These plants tend to be larger major 
sources and have higher unit compliance costs. The remaining plants’ compliance burden is

offset by higher cement prices, and total plant operating profits increase by $125 million. These 
plants are typically smaller area sources and have lower unit compliance costs compared with 
their competitors. 
Within the group of plants with operating losses, EPA identified six domestic plants with 
negative operating profits and significant utilization changes that could temporarily idle until 
market demand conditions improve (see Table 3-9). The plants are small capacity plants with 
unit compliance costs close to $5 per ton; they account for approximately 2.5% of domestic

capacity. If the plant owners did decide to permanently shut down these plants, the reduction in 
domestic supply would lead to additional projected market price increases. Reducing national 
supply by an additional 2 million metric tons and holding other domestic and foreign supply 
fixed, EPA calculations suggest the national cement price could rise by 6.5% ($5.80 per metric 
ton). 
3.3 Direct Compliance Cost Method for White Cement Kilns and Kilns Coming On 
Line in 2013 
The partial-equilibrium analysis is an illustrative example of the economic impacts 
associated with the engineering cost analysis for existing kilns ($280 million in direct 
compliance costs). In addition, EPA developed a separate engineering cost analysis for four 
white cement kilns and an additional 20 kilns that are likely to come on line by 2013. These costs 
were not included in the EIA because of uncertainties associated with cement market conditions 
in 2013. 
The total annualized costs for white cement kilns are $1.5 million, or $4.90 per metric ton 
of clinker capacity. Using reported 2005 data from the USGS on the average mill net value of 
white cement ($176 per metric ton), this cost represents between 2.5 and 2.8% of the product 
value. 
 3-12 
Using a model kiln with a clinker capacity of 1.2 million metric tons, EPA estimates the 
total annualized costs for 20 additional kilns coming on line in 2013 to be $86 million. The 
average cost per ton of clinker capacity is approximately $4.00.5 
Using a range of historical national price data and unit cost data, EPA conducted sales 
tests for a representative kiln: 
Sales Test Ratio = Control Costs ($/ton)/F.O.B Cement Prices ($/ton). 
The USGS reports that the real price of cement per metric ton (2005 dollars) has typically 
ranged between $75 and $100 since 1990. A sales test using these data shows cost-to-sales ratios 
(CSRs) between 3 and 5% (see Figure 3-2).

5 Using a cement/clinker ratio of 1.14, this is approximately $3.50 per ton of cement. 
 3-13 
From 2000 to 2006, the PCA reports that the average operating profit rates for the 
industry ranged from 17 to 21% (PCA, 2008c). If these profit data are representative of operating 
profit rates for new kilns, kilns could potentially significantly reduce their operating profit rates. 
As a result, companies may have the incentive to look for less expensive alternatives to meet the 
emission standards. If these alternatives are limited or not cost effective, the NESHAP may lead 
companies to consider delaying rates of construction of these new kilns until market conditions 
change (e.g., increases in demand that lead to rising cement prices) to cover these additional 
control costs.  
3.4 Social Cost Estimates 
The market adjustments in price and quantity were used to estimate the changes in 
aggregate economic welfare using applied welfare economics principles (see Appendix C). Table 
3-10 presents the estimates of the social costs and their distribution. Higher cement prices and 
reduced consumption lead to consumer welfare losses ($402 million). Domestic producers (in 
aggregate) experience a net loss of $204 million. As noted in the previous section, individual 
domestic producers will gain or lose depending on the change in costs versus the change in the 
regional market prices. The total domestic surplus loss (consumer and producers) totals $606 
million. Other countries selling cement to the United States will benefit from higher cement 
prices (a surplus gain of $89 million). The resulting net change in total surplus estimated by the 
partial-equilibrium analysis is $517 million.  
The estimated social cost of the proposed NESHAP is $606 million. This estimate 
includes the results for existing kilns included in the partial-equilibrium analysis ($517 million) 
and the direct compliance costs for white cement kilns ($2 million) and 20 additional kilns 
projected to come on line in 2013 ($86 million). The social estimates are significantly higher 
than the engineering analysis estimate of annualized costs totaling $368 million. This is a direct 
consequence of EPA’s assumptions about existing domestic plants’ pricing behavior discussed 
extensively in previous cement industry rulemakings and in Section 2 and Appendix B of this 
RIA. Under baseline conditions without regulation, the existing domestic cement plants are 
assumed to choose a production level that is less than the level produced under perfect 
competition. As a result, a preexisting market distortion exists in the markets covered by the 
proposed rule (i.e., the observed baseline market price is higher than the [unobserved] market 
price that a model of perfect competition would predict). The imposition of additional regulatory 
costs tends to widen the gap between price and marginal cost in these markets and contributes to 
additional social costs. The above social costs for 2013 include annualized capital costs over the 
expected lifetime of the equipment and an opportunity cost of capital (7%) discount rate. To 
 3-14 
facilitate comparisons of benefits and costs when estimates vary of time across multiple years, 
EPA typically estimates a “consumption equivalent” present value measure of costs. This could 
be computed using a consumption rate of interest of 3% and 7%. However, this calculation was 
not necessary since the cost and benefit analyses only produce estimates for a single year 
(OAQPS, 1999a).

3.5 Energy Impacts 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) provides that agencies will prepare 
and submit to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, a 
Statement of Energy Effects for certain actions identified as “significant energy actions.” Section 
4(b) of Executive Order 13211 defines “significant energy actions” as any action by an agency 
(normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the 
promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of 
proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking: (1) (i) that is a significant regulatory 
action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order, and (ii) is likely to have a significant 
adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (2) that is designated by the 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as a significant energy action. 
This rule is not a significant energy action as designated by the Administrator of the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs because it is not likely to have a significant adverse 
impact on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. EPA has prepared an analysis of energy 
impacts that explains this conclusion below. 
 3-15 
To enhance understanding regarding the regulation’s influence on energy consumption, 
EPA examined publicly available data describing the cement sector’s energy consumption. The 
AEO 2009 (DOE, 2008) provides energy consumption data. As shown in Table 3-11, this 
industry accounts for less than 0.4% of the U.S. total energy consumption. As a result, any 
energy consumption changes attributable to the regulatory program should not significantly 
influence the supply, distribution, or use of energy. EPA has also estimated the

SECTION 4  
SMALL BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency 
certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities (SISNOSE). The first step in this assessment was to determine whether the rule 
will have SISNOSE. To make this determination, EPA used a screening and market analysis to 
indicate whether EPA can certify the rule as not having a SISNOSE. The elements of this 
analysis included 
 identifying affected small entities, 
 selecting and describing the measures and economic impact thresholds used in the 
analysis, and 
 completing the assessment and determining the SISNOSE certification category. 
4.1 Identify Affected Small Entities 
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, small 
entity is defined as (1) a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration’s 
regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; according to these size standards, ultimate parent companies 
owning Portland cement manufacturing plants are categorized as small if the total number of 
employees at the firm is fewer than 750 (see Table 4-1 for list); (2) a small governmental 
jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a 
population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise 
that is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field. As reported in Section 
2, EPA has identified four small entities (see Table 4-1). One of the four entities is owned by a 
small Tribal government (Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community). The remaining three 
entities are small businesses. 
4.2 Sales and Revenue Test Screening Analysis 
In the next step of the analysis, EPA assessed how the regulatory program may influence 
the profitability of ultimate parent companies by comparing pollution control costs to total sales 
(i.e., a “sales” test). To do this, we divided an ultimate parent company’s total annualized 
compliance costs by its reported revenue:

TRj = total sales from all operations of ultimate parent company j or annual 
government revenue. 
This method assumes the affected entity cannot shift pollution control costs to consumers 
(in the form of higher market prices). Instead, the owning entity experiences a one-for-one 
reduction in profits. For small entities, the total reduction in profits under this method is 
approximately $7, and the average loss is $0.7 million per kiln. 
 4-3 
The results of the screening analysis, presented in Figure 4-1 and Table 4-2, show that 
one small business has a CSR greater than 3%. One small business and one small government 
have an estimated CSR between 1 and 3%. The average (median) CSR for small entities is 2.0% 
(1.5%), and the average and median CSR for all large entities is 0.5% (0.3%).

4.3 Additional Market Analysis 
In additional to the screening analysis, EPA also examined small entity effects after 
accounting for market adjustments. Under this assumption, the entities recover some of the 
regulatory program costs as the market price adjusts in response to higher cement production 
costs. Even after accounting for these adjustments, small entity operating profits fall by $4 
million, or 9% (see Table 4-3). However, all nine cement kilns continue to operate under with-
regulation conditions. As cement production falls, employment may decline by up to 23 
employees, a 5% reduction.

SECTION 5  
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
5.1 Summary 
EPA benefits estimates are the monetized human health co-benefits of reducing cases of 
morbidity and premature mortality among populations exposed to PM2.5 from installing controls 
to limit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), such as mercury, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbons.  
For the proposed Portland Cement NESHAP, EPA estimates the PM2.5-related co-benefits of to 
be $4.4 billion to $11 billion (2005$) in the year of full implementation (2013).1  These are our 
preferred estimates, which reflect EPA’s most current interpretation of the scientific literature on 
PM2.5 and mortality.  They reflect our updated benefits methodology (i.e., a no-threshold model 
that calculates incremental benefits down to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air quality levels and 
incorporates two technical updates) compared to the estimates in previous RIAs that did not 
include these changes. 2  The anchor points for these estimates are derived from two empirical 
(epidemiological) studies of the relationship between ambient PM2.5 and premature mortality (the 
extended analyses of the Harvard Six Cities study by Laden et al (2006) and the American 
Cancer Society cohort by Pope et al (2002)).  Since 2006, EPA had calculated benefits based on 
these two empirical studies, but derived the range of benefits, including the minimum and 
maximum results, from an expert elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and 
premature mortality (Roman et al., 2008).  Using alternate relationships between PM2.5 and 
premature mortality supplied by experts, higher and lower benefits estimates are plausible (see 
Figure 5-1 below), but most of the expert-based estimates fall between the two epidemiology-
based estimates (Roman et al., 2008).  Methodological limitations prevented EPA from

1 These benefits results use a 3% discount rate.  Using a 7% discount rate, the benefits are about 9% to 10% less.

estimates the PM2.5-related co-benefits of the proposed Portland Cement NESHAP to be $ 3.1 billion to $ 6.5 
billion (2005$) in the year of full implementation (2013).

5.2 Calculation of Human Health Benefits 
To estimate the PM2.5-related human health benefits of reducing emissions from the 
proposed NESHAP for Portland Cement kilns, EPA used the benefits transfer approach it created 
for the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) accompanying the recent National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone.1,2  This methodology incorporates the best available science, 
which is described in detail below.  In that RIA, EPA developed and applied PM2.5 benefit-per-
ton coefficients to estimate the PM2.5 co-benefits resulting from reductions in emissions of NOX.

EPA has followed that same approach to estimate the health benefits for the projected emission 
reductions of PM2.5 precursor pollutants associated with this proposal, but has made incremental 
updates to the benefit-per-ton estimates to reflect new science and data, as discussed below. 
EPA did not perform an air quality modeling assessment of the emission reductions 
resulting from installing controls on these kilns because of the time and resource constraints and 
the limited value of such an analysis for the purposes of developing the regulatory approach for 
this proposal.  This lack of air quality modeling limited EPA’s ability to perform a 
comprehensive benefits analysis for this proposal because our benefits model BenMAP requires 
either air quality modeling or monitoring data.  In the absence of formal air quality modeling, we 
applied PM2.5 benefit-per-ton coefficients to estimate benefits.  In addition to the 2008 Ozone 
NAAQS RIA, this benefit-per-ton approach has been used in RIAs prepared for a number of 
previous EPA rulemakings (e.g., the 2002 large industrial spark ignition engine and recreational 
vehicles rule, the 2004 Industrial Boilers and Process Heaters MACT, and the 2008 Petroleum 
Refineries NSPS). 
The benefit per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human health benefits (the sum 
of premature mortality and morbidity related benefits) of reducing one ton of PM2.5 or PM2.5 
precursor emissions from a specified source.  We include direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursor 
emissions (SOX).  These PM benefits are actually co-benefits, which result from the installing 
controls to limit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).  Methodological limitations prevented EPA 
from quantifying the monetized benefits of other emissions reductions from this proposed 
NESHAP, including 8 tons of mercury, 3,900 tons of hydrochloric acid, and 14,780 tons of total 
hydrocarbons annually.  In addition, these monetized benefits do not incorporate additional 
emission reductions that would occur if cement facilities temporarily idle or reduce capacity 
utilization as a result of this regulation.  Using the benefit-per-ton approach, we are unable to 
monetize the anticipated improvements in visibility due to reductions in PM2.5 and PM2.5 
precursors. 
The PM co-benefits estimates in this proposal analysis utilize the same concentration-
response functions as described in the PM NAAQS RIA analysis.1  Each data source is described 
below: 
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported in Pope

et al. (2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary benefits 
estimate.  When calculating the preferred estimate, EPA applied the effect coefficient 
as reported in the study without an adjustment for assumed concentration threshold of 
10 µg/m3 as was done in recent (post 2006) RIAs. 
 One estimate is based on the C-R function developed from the extended analysis of 
the Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by Laden et al (2006).  This study, 
published after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM NAAQS, has been 
used as an alternative estimate in the PM NAAQS RIA and PM co-benefits estimates 
in RIAs completed since the PM NAAQS.  When calculating the preferred estimate, 
EPA applied the effect coefficient as reported in the study without an adjustment for 
assumed concentration threshold of 10 µg/m3 as was done in recent (post 2006) RIAs.  
 Twelve estimates are based on the C-R functions from EPA’s expert elicitation 
study1,2 on the PM-mortality relationship and interpreted for benefits analysis in 
EPA’s final RIA for the PM NAAQS.  For that study, twelve experts (labeled A 
through L) provided independent estimates of the PM-mortality concentration-
response function.  EPA practice has been to develop independent estimates of PM-
mortality estimates corresponding to the concentration-response function provided by 
each of the twelve experts, to better characterize the degree of variability in the expert 
responses. 
The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 
population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006)3.  These are logical choices for anchor points in our 
presentation because, while both studies are well designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths 
and weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for using both studies to generate  
benefits estimates.  Using estimates from both cohorts substantially narrows the range of benefits 
estimates when compared to the range of estimates from the expert elicitation..  Because the 
experts used these studies based on these cohorts to inform their concentration-response 
functions, benefits estimates using these functions generally fall between results using these 
epidemiology studies.  As Figure 5-1 illustrates, the Pope et al. (2002) and Laden et al. (2006) 
estimates, based on the ACS and Six Cities cohorts, respectively, capture the  mass of expert

opinion, while preserving the empirical basis of our estimates.  This presentation style is flexible 
enough to incorporate future epidemiology studies based on these cohorts.  
In recent RIAs, EPA presented benefits estimates using concentration response functions 
derived from the PM2.5 Expert Elicitation as a range from the lowest expert value (Expert K) to 
the highest expert value (Expert E) (Roman et al., 2008; IEc, 2006).  Although this approach 
characterized the bounds of the expert elicitation, it generated a range of benefits estimates 
extending nearly an order of magnitude.  In addition, this approach did not indicate the agency’s 
judgment on what the best estimate of PM benefits may be.  According to EPA’s Science 
Advisory Board, this presentation was misleading because:  
1. “…[T]his is, in fact, a form of aggregation that assigns positive weight to the most 
extreme judgments and zero weight to all the others…,”1 and  
2. “…[T]he casual reader could easily infer substantial differences in scientific opinion 
when, in fact, there was a pronounced central cluster of views on PM2.5 mortality.”2 
The SAB advice captures the tension between providing readers with a coherent estimate 
of total benefits while also respecting the underlying uncertainty in the epidemiology-derived 
estimates of PM mortality.  For this reason, above we present the cohort-based benefits estimates 
as well as the results of the Expert Elicitation jointly (see Figure 5-1).3   
 The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 
population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).4  These two studies are logical choices, given that EPA has 
previously applied effect coefficients from each analysis and these studies informed the 
judgment of the twelve experts as they developed their estimates.5  While both studies are well 
designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths and weaknesses inherent in each, which we

3 In the near term, we are using two alternate PM mortality estimates as a surrogate for a single central estimate, 
which will likely be interpreted as a range.  We are still trying to determine how to present two alternate benefits 
estimates without implying a range, and we will continue to develop methods to improve the clarity of the 
benefits presentation.  
4 The American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort analyzed by Pope et al. includes a larger number of cities, and a 
greater population size, than the Harvard Six Cities cohort.  However, the ACS cohort is also more affluent and 
less diverse, than the average population.  Alternately, the Six Cities cohort offers a superior estimate of PM 
exposure. 
5 According to the expert elicitation report, “All of the experts cited the long-term cohort-based studies as major 
evidence in support of a positive relationship between ambient annual average PM2.5 concentrations and 
mortality” (IEc, 2006, page 3-10). 
 5-6 
believe argues for using both studies to generate the benefits estimates.  Using both estimates 
from each cohort substantially narrows the range of benefits estimates.  Because the experts used 
these studies based on these cohorts to inform their concentration-response functions, benefits 
estimates using these functions generally fall between results using these epidemiology studies.  
As Figure 5-1 illustrates, the Pope et al. (2002) and Laden et al. (2006) estimates, based on the 
ACS and Six Cities cohorts, respectively, capture the  mass of expert opinion, while preserving 
the empirical basis of our estimates.  This presentation style is flexible enough to incorporate 
future epidemiology studies based on these cohorts.  Finally, this approach is generally 
consistent with advice from both the National Academy of Sciences (NRC, 2002) and the 
Science Advisory Board (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004) directing EPA to rely upon prospective cohort 
studies as the basis for estimating PM mortality effects.  
Within this benefits chapter, EPA presents independent estimates of PM-mortality 
estimates corresponding to the concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve 
experts to better characterize the degree of variability in the expert responses.  Because in this 
RIA we estimate benefits using benefit-per-ton estimates, technical limitations prevent us from 
providing the associated credible intervals with the expert functions.  EPA believes that the 
estimates derived from the expert elicitation are indicative of the uncertainty associated with a 
major component of the health impact functions; whereas, the benefits represented by estimates 
derived from Pope et al. and Laden et al. represent the preferred estimates of PM co-benefits.  In 
general, the expert elicitation results support the conclusion that the benefits of PM2.5 control are 
very likely to be substantial. 
To develop the estimate of the co-benefits of reducing emissions from this proposal, we 
calculated the monetized benefits-per-ton of emissions reduction estimates for direct PM2.5 and 
each PM2.5 precursor pollutant.  Readers interested in the complete methodology for creating the 
benefit-per-ton estimates used in this analysis may consult the Technical Support Document 
(TSD) accompanying the final Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008c).  In the TSD, we describe 
in detail how we generated the benefit-per-ton estimates.  In summary, we used a model to 
convert emissions of direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (i.e., SO2, NOX, and VOCs) into changes 
in PM2.5 air quality.  Next, we used the benefits model (BenMAP) to estimate the changes in 
human health based on the change in PM2.5 air quality.  Finally, the monetized health benefits 
were divided by the emission reductions to create the benefit-per-ton estimates.  Even though all 
fine particles are assumed to have equivalent health effects, the benefit-per-ton estimates vary 
between precursors because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form 
PM2.5.  For example, SOX has a lower benefit-per-ton estimate than direct PM2.5 because it may 
 5-7 
form PM2.5 further from population centers than directly emitted PM2.5 and thus and the 
monetized health benefits would be lower.  After generating the benefit-per-ton estimate, we 
then multiply this estimate by the number of tons of each pollutant reduced to derive an overall 
monetary value of benefits. 
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits 
modeling assumptions.  Use of these $/ton values to estimate benefits associated with different 
emission control programs (e.g., for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) 
may lead to higher or lower benefit estimates than if benefits were calculated based on direct air 
quality modeling.  Great care should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions 
occurring in any specific location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission 
reduction programs and therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United 
States.  The benefits-per-ton for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different 
from the national average. 
5.3 Assumptions regarding Thresholds in the Health Impact Function 
The preferred benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified 
versions of the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis.  
Specifically, EPA selected the same mortality and morbidity studies as were used in that RIA, 
but used models both with and without an assumed threshold for PM2.5 related threshold adverse 
effects to test the sensitivity of this assumption.  The Agency’s peer review process conducted 
through the Science Advisory Board has provided advice regarding analytic treatment of 
thresholds for PM multiple times. 
 In 1999, the SAB Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis (ACCACA) 
concluded that there was currently no scientific basis for selecting any specific 
threshold (EPA-SAB, 1999). 
 In 2004, the Health and Environmental Effect subcommittee of ACCACA concluded, 
“it is reasonable for EPA to assume a no threshold model down to, at least, the low 
end of the concentrations reported in the studies” (EPA-SAB, 2004). 
 In 2005, CASAC indicated that “[t]he available epidemiological database on daily 
mortality and morbidity does not establish either the presence or absence of threshold 
concentrations for adverse health effects” (EPA-SAB, 2005). 
In addition, in 2002, as a part of their review of EPA benefits methods, the National 
Research Council concluded that there is no evidence for any departure from linearity in the 
observed range of exposure to PM10 or PM2.5, nor any indication of a threshold (NRC, 2002).  
 5-8 
They cite the weight of evidence available from both short- and long-term exposure models and 
the similar effects found in cities with low and high ambient concentrations of PM. 
These conclusions were based on a wide body of peer-reviewed literature on health 
effects of short and longer term PM exposures (Daniels et al., 2000; Pope, 2000; Pope et al., 
2002; Rossi et al., 1999; Schwartz and Zanobetti, 2000; Schwartz et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2000; 
Krewski et al., 2000). 
In the time since the CASAC advice was received, the EPA, with close OMB 
collaboration, conducted a PM2.5 Expert Elicitation in which experts were asked to describe the 
true relationship between PM2.5 exposure and premature mortality (Roman, 2008; I.Ec., 2006).  
Of the 12 experts included in the elicitation, only one expert (Expert K) elected to specify a 
threshold, as the rest cited a lack of empirical and/or theoretical basis for a population threshold.  
Expert K specified a 50% chance of no threshold, a 40% chance that there would be a threshold 
at a concentration of less than 5 µg/m3, and only a 10% chance that there would be a threshold 
between 5 and 10 µg/m3.  No expert thought that there was any chance that there would be a 
threshold in excess of 10 µg/m3.  In addition, a recent extended follow-up of the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort concluded that the concentration response function is linear with no threshold 
(Schwartz, 2008).  
In its December 2008 draft Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), EPA's Office of 
Research and Development concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-
threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response 
relationship, while recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-
response function.  CASAC is currently considering EPA's assessment (in the PM2.5 ISA) of the 
body of evidence on the shape of the C-R function relating PM2.5 and mortality, including the 
evidence regarding the existence of a threshold.  The CASAC is also currently considering EPA's 
draft scope and methods document for the PM risk and exposure assessment, which proposes to 
use the no-threshold model as the primary model for estimating mortality risk from PM2.5 
exposures.   The ISA is being revised and will be reviewed again by the CASAC in October 
2009, concurrent with the review of the first draft risk assessment.  Although this document does 
not represent final agency policy that has undergone the full agency scientific review process, it  
provides a basis for reconsidering the application of thresholds in PM2.5 concentration-response 
functions used in EPA’s RIAs. 
 5-9 
5.4 Updating the Benefits Data Underlying the Benefit-per-Ton Estimates 
As described above, the estimates provided are derived through a benefits transfer 
technique that adapts monetized benefits from reductions in PM2.5 precursor pollutants that were 
estimated for the Ozone RIA utilizing nationally distributed emissions reductions.  Our preferred 
benefit-per-ton estimates for this analysis have been updated since the Ozone RIA was 
completed, and they reflect EPA’s most current interpretation of the scientific literature on PM2.5 
and mortality.  These estimates include a new population dataset, an expanded geographic scope 
of the benefit-per-ton calculation, and the functions directly from the epidemiology studies 
without a threshold adjustment.   They reflect our updated benefits methodology (i.e., a no-
threshold model that calculates incremental benefits down to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air 
quality levels and incorporates two technical updates) compared to the estimates in previous 
RIAs that did not include these changes.  Because the benefits are sensitive to the assumption of a 
threshold, we also provide a sensitivity analysis using the previous methodology (i.e., a threshold 
model at 10 µg/m3 without the two technical updates) as a historical reference.  Approximately 
75% of the difference between the previous methodology and the updated methodology for this 
rule is due to removing thresholds with 25% due to the two technical updates.  This percentage 
breakdown would vary for other rules depending on the combination of emission reductions 
from different sources and PM2.5 precursor pollutants. 
EPA is currently in the process of generating localized benefit-per-ton estimates to better 
account for the spatial heterogeneity of benefits for a small number of urban areas.  EPA believes 
that these estimates may better represent the localized benefits of emission reductions at a 
specific location than benefits estimates that use national averages.  However, because the kilns 
affected by this rule are widely distributed nationally, we believe that the national estimates are 
most appropriate for this analysis. 
5.5 Results of Benefits Analysis 
Using the preferred no-threshold model, in the year of full implementation (2013), EPA 
estimates the benefits of this proposal to be $4.4 billion to $11 billion and $4.0 billion to $9.7 
billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates respectively.1  Using the threshold model without technical 
updates, EPA estimates the benefits of this proposal to be $3.1 billion to $6.5 billion and $2.8 
billion to $5.9 billion, at 3% and 7% discount rates respectively.  Because the benefits are 
sensitive to the assumption of a threshold, we present the results using the threshold model below 
                                                 
1 The benefits are discounted to account for the cessation lag in PM2.5 benefits from premature mortality and acute 
myocardial infarctions (AMIs), rather than a discounted stream of future benefits; whereas discounting the costs 
reflects the lifetime costs of the equipment.  For this reason, it is appropriate in this context to use two different 
discount rates for the benefits and costs.

to show the sensitivity of this assumption.  Tables 5-1 and 5-2 provide  general summaries of the 
results by precursor pollutant, including the emissions reductions and monetized benefits-per-ton 
using the no-threshold model and the threshold model (without technical updates), respectively.1, 
2  Table 5-3 provides a summary of the reductions in health incidences associated with the 
benefit per ton estimates.  Incidence estimates using the threshold-based benefit-per-ton 
methodology have not been calculated.  Figure 5-3 provides a visual representation of the range 
of benefits estimates by precursor pollutant at a 3% discount rate using the no-threshold model.  
More details on the regulatory scenario, emissions, and emission reductions can be found in 
Section 4 of this RIA.

2 Because of the absence of data, we are unable to quantify the amount of reductions in condensable PM. PM 
emissions consist of both a filterable fraction and a condensable fraction, which exists as a gas in an exhaust 
stream and condenses to form particulate once the gas enters the ambient air.  Most condensable PM is PM2.5.  In 
this analysis, all emission reductions and the corresponding benefits estimates reflect only the filterable fraction.

PM2.5 Precursor in 2013 using the no-threshold model a 
a This graph shows the estimated benefits by precursor pollutant using effect coefficients derived from the Pope et 
al. study and the Laden et al, study at a 3% discount rate.  The breakdown by precursor pollutant would be similar 
at a 7% discount rate and using the threshold model.  All fine particles are assumed to have equivalent health 
effects, but the benefit-per-ton estimates vary because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to 
become PM2.5 
 
5.6 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Benefits Estimates 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty.  Many inputs 
are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior).  There is uncertainty at each stage of the analytic process to generate benefits 
estimates.  For some parameters or inputs, it may be possible to provide a statistical 
representation of the underlying uncertainty distribution.  For other parameters or inputs, the 
 5-13 
necessary information is not available.  Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the relative 
importance of each source of uncertainty, particularly when using benefit-per-ton estimates.  
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year.  Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately.  As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5-5), there is a variety 
of uncertainties associated with these PM benefits.  Therefore, the estimates of annual benefits 
should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of benefits expected, rather than the actual 
benefits that would occur every year. 
The benefits estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.  For 
example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for premature mortality, which typically 
account for at least 90% of the total PM benefits, we were able to identify the following 
uncertainties:  
1. Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature death at 
concentrations near those experienced by most Americans on a daily basis.  Although 
biological mechanisms for this effect have not been established definitively yet, the 
weight of the available epidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality. 
2. All fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in 
causing premature mortality.  This is an important assumption, because PM produced 
via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ significantly from direct 
PM released from diesel engines and other industrial sources, but no clear scientific 
grounds exist for supporting differential effects estimates by particle type.  
3. The impact function for fine particles is approximately linear within the range of 
ambient concentrations under consideration.  Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard.  
4. The forecasts for future emissions and associated air quality modeling are valid.  
Although recognizing the difficulties, assumptions, and inherent uncertainties in the 
overall enterprise, these analyses are based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and 
up-to-date assessment tools, and we believe the results are highly useful in assessing 
this proposal.  
5. Benefits estimated here reflect the application of a national dollar benefit-per-ton 
estimate of the benefits of reducing directly emitted fine particulates from point 
sources.  Because they are based on national-level analysis, the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used here do not reflect local variability in population density, meteorology, 
 5-14 
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an 
over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted 
fine particulates.  
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the 
benefits model (BenMAP).  Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and 
associated estimates of uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the 
significant differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here.  
However, the results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in 
Chapter 5 of the PM RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the benefits 
results presented in this analysis.  In this analysis, we provide additional benefits results that use 
the functions obtained in the expert elicitation as a reasonable characterization of the uncertainty 
in the relationship between PM2.5 and mortality.  Because this analysis uses benefit-per-ton 
estimates, we are only able to present the mean benefits results using the expert functions 
without the associated credible intervals.  We recognize that this captures only a fraction of the 
overall uncertainty.  We also recognize that the magnitude of the mortality C-R function is a 
critical parameter in the analysis, and the uncertainty in that parameter is likely to contribute a 
large fraction of the overall uncertainty in the benefits estimates.  Tables 5-4 and 5-5 show all 14 
benefits estimates for the no-threshold and threshold models, including those based on expert 
functions, at discount rates of 3% and 7%.1  Figures 5-4 and 5-5 show the data from Tables 5-3 
and 5-4 in a graphical form.

5.7 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
Using the no-threshold model, in the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates 
the benefits of this proposal to be $4.4 billion to $11 billion and $4.0 billion to $9.7 billion, at 
3% and 7% discount rates respectively.1  Annualized domestic social costs are $694 million at a 
7% discount rate as mentioned in Section 4 of this RIA.2  Thus, the net benefits (i.e., benefits in 
2013 minus annualized costs) are $3.7 billion to $11 billion and $3.3 billion to $9.0 billion, at 
3% and 7% discount rates respectively.  Using alternate relationships between PM2.5 and 
premature mortality supplied by experts, higher and lower benefits estimates are plausible (see 
Figure 5-6), but most of the expert-based estimates fall between the two epidemiology-based 
                                                 
1 The benefits are discounted to account for the cessation lag in PM2.5 benefits from premature mortality and acute 
myocardial infarctions (AMIs), rather than a discounted stream of future benefits; whereas discounting the costs 
reflects the lifetime costs of the equipment.  For this reason, it is appropriate in this context to use different 
discount rates for the benefits and costs.  
2 The domestic social cost does not include the estimated $89 million surplus gain for foreign producers.

estimates.  EPA believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the costs by a substantial margin 
under this proposal even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.

APPENDIX A 
REGIONAL PORTLAND CEMENT MARKETS AND ECONOMIC MODEL 
 
 A-1 
The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has adopted the standard-
industry level analysis described in the Office’s resource manual (EPA, 1999a). This approach is 
consistent with previous EPA analyses of the Portland cement industry (EPA, 1998; EPA, 
1999b) and uses a single-period static partial-equilibrium model to compare prepolicy cement 
market baselines with expected postpolicy outcomes in these markets. The benchmark time 
horizon for the analysis is the intermediate run where producers have some constraints on their 
flexibility to adjust factors of production. This time horizon allows us to capture important 
transitory impacts of the program on existing producers. Key measures in this analysis include 
 market-level effects (market prices, changes in domestic production and 
consumption, and international trade), 
 industry-level effects (changes in revenues, costs, profits, employment), 
 facility-level effects (plant utilization changes), and 
 social costs (changes in producer and consumer surplus). 
The partial equilibrium analysis performed for this rule develops a cement market model 
that simulates how stakeholders (consumers and firms) may respond to the additional regulatory 
program costs. In this appendix, we provide details on the baseline data, behavioral assumptions, 
parameters, and model equations. 
A.1 Baseline Market Data 
Cement sales are often concentrated locally among a small number of firms for two 
reasons: high transportation costs and production economies of scale.1 Transportation costs 
significantly influence where cement is ultimately sold; high transportation costs relative to unit 
value provide incentives to produce and sell cement locally in regional markets (USITC, 2006). 
To support this claim, the empirical literature has typically pointed to Census of Transportation 
data showing over 80% of cement shipments were made within a 200-mile radius (Jans and 
Rosenbaum, 1997) and reported evidence of high transportation costs per dollar of product value 
from case studies (Ryan, 2006). Based on this literature, the Agency assumed that the U.S. 
Portland cement industry is divided into a number of independent regional markets with each 
having a single market-clearing price. 
To estimate cement demand for each of the 20 cement markets, RTI collected the 
Portland Cement Association’s (2004) reported annual kiln clinker capacity data and state-level 
                                                 
1 The 2002 Economic Census reports that the national Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for cement NAICS 32731 
is 568. However, this measure likely not representative of actual concentration that exists in regional markets. 
 A-2 
utilization rates reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Utilization rates are reported in 
Table A-1. For each kiln, we calculated clinker production as follows: 
 Kiln Clinker Production = State-Level Utilization Rate x Annual Clinker Capacity. 
Next, we summed clinker production across kilns to obtain domestic clinker production 
in the United States. However, to match the 2005 national clinker production data (87,405 metric 
tons) from the USGS (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2006a, Table 1), we applied a scaling 
factor to these USGS utilization rates (value = 1.103). When making this calculation, we did 
constrain each kiln’s clinker production capacity utilization rate to be 95% or less. With this 
adjustment, kiln clinker production is computed as follows: 
Kiln Clinker Production = 
Minimum[(State-Level Utilization Rate x 1.103 x Annual Clinker Capacity), (0.95 x Annual 
Clinker Capacity)]. 
Next, we summed clinker production across kilns in each market to obtain domestic 
clinker production in each cement market (m): 
( )Domestic  Clinker Production  Kiln Clinker Productionm imi= ∑ . 
We calculated Portland cement production by applying a ratio of Portland cement 
production to clinker production (value = 1.07) that leads us to match the reported 2005 national 
Portland cement production data (93,904 metric tons) from the USGS: 
( )Domestic  Portland Cement Production  Kiln Clinker Production Cement Factorm imi= ×∑ . 
A portion of cement market demand is also met by international imports. We collected 
hydraulic cement import data by customs district from the USGS (2006a) and assigned these 
imports to markets using a district-to-market mapping shown in Table A-2. The USGS reports 
hydraulic cement imports were approximately 33.3 million metric tons in 2005. 
Total grey Portland cement demand was 126.8 million metric tons in 2005 and ranged 
from 3.6 million metric tons in the Seattle market to 13.4 million metric tons in the Los Angeles 
market (see Table A-3). White cement demand was 2.1 million metric tons.

For cement prices, we used the district-level average value per metric ton data reported 
by USGS (2006a, Table 11) and assigned a value to each state. Values represent mill net or ex-
plant (free on board plant) valuations of total sales to final customers, including sales from plant. 
To calculate a price for the 20 cement markets in the model (see Table A-4), we computed a 
weighted average price using production and state price information for each kiln.

a Hydraulic cement. The vast majority of these imports are Portland cement (approximately 29 million metric tons, 
or 86%). Excludes Puerto Rico. 
To illustrate this calculation, we use the following simple example for the Seattle market. 
There are two domestic kilns in Washington; one kiln produces approximately 660,000 metric 
tons of cement, while the other produces approximately 420,000 metric tons of cement per year. 
The USGS reports the same average value per metric ton of cement in Oregon and Washington 
($88 dollars). To derive the market price for the Seattle market, we perform the following 
calculation: 
$88 × 660/(660 + 420) + $88 × 420/(660 + 420) = $88. 
A.2 Cost Function Updates for 2005

function developed in a microeconomic study of kiln use and retirement (Das, 1992). Das

describes five variable inputs in cement production: raw materials, repair and maintenance, 
labor, electricity, and fuel. Raw materials serve as the kiln feed, repair and maintenance are 
required for periodic upkeep of the kiln, labor is used in the quarry and for packing, electricity is 
consumed mainly by the auxiliary equipment, and fuel is largely consumed by the kilns.  
The AVC function (expressed in dollars per metric ton of cement) can be written as 
 AVC = AVMI *Pm + AVRI * Pr + AVLI * w + AVFI *Pf f + AVEI * Pe, 
where AVRI, AVLI, AVFI, AVEI, and AVMI are the average variable inputs of materials, repair 
and maintenance, labor, fuel, and electricity, and Pm, Pr, w, Pf, and Pe are the prices of each 
variable input.  
For the updated model, RTI collected data from the Portland Cement Association (PCA, 
2005) and government statistical publications and updated selected cost function parameters. 
These updates are presented and discussed in this section. 
 A-7 
A.2.1 Raw Materials 
In Table A-5, we report the quantities of raw material inputs, cement production, and the 
raw material input ratio for the U.S. cement industry. In 2005, approximately 1.67 metric tons of 
raw materials were required to make a metric ton of cement.

State raw material prices for crushed stone range between $4 and $13 per metric ton 
(Table A-6). To calculate raw material costs, we multiplied state raw material prices by the raw 
material input ratio (1.67). 
A.2.2 Repair and Maintenance 
Rock Products (1994) magazine reports the 1993 values of annual repair and maintenance 
costs by kiln capacity (Table A-7). Since more recent repair and maintenance costs are not 
available, we adjusted these costs to 2005 dollars using the gross domestic product (GDP) 
deflator (U.S. BEA, 2007). 
A.2.3 Labor 
The Portland Cement Association reports labor productivity measures in terms of metric 
tons of cement per employee hour. We used these data to calculate the average variable labor 
inputs (AVLI): a measure of employee hours needed per ton of cement. AVLI estimates are 
computed by taking the inverse of each labor productivity measure. Table A-8 shows labor 
productivity continues to vary by process type and kiln size. Productivity is higher for dry 
process kilns compared with wet kilns; it is also higher for large-capacity kilns.  
State average hourly earnings for the durable goods industry are presented in Table A-9. 
To calculate labor costs, we multiplied state average hourly earnings by labor hours per metric 
ton.

A.2.4 Electricity 
To reflect the differences in electricity consumption process type and kiln size, we 
collected energy consumption (kWh) and production data (Table A-10). We computed electricity 
consumption rates (AVEI) as follows:  
 AVEI = kWh/(0.92*Clinker Production + 0.08*Finished Cement Production). 
This approach follows the Portland Cement Association’s energy-efficiency measures 
using “equivalent tons” (PCA, 2005). This measure is composed of 92% clinker production and 
8% finished cement production.

Table A-11 presents state electricity prices. To calculate electricity costs, we multiplied 
these prices by AVEI. 
A.2.5 Fuel 
Das (1992) represents average variable fuel input rates using the following expression: 
 AVFI = (1 + constant)Age in 2005 * average variable fuel input of a new kiln. 
We used the calibration procedures described from EPA’s 1998 cement study to compute 
a revised average variable primary fuel input of a new kiln. The constant used remains 0.0087, 
and Table A-12 reports the average variable fuel input of a new kiln by its process type and its 
capacity.  
The AEO 2007 reports other industrial coal, natural gas, and residual fuel prices by 
census region (Table A-13) (Energy Information Administration, 2007). For petroleum coke 
price, we used the procedure outlined in the Energy Information Administration’s State Energy 
Consumption, Price, and Expenditure Estimates (SEDS): Technical Notes Prices and 
Expenditures Section 4 (DOE, 2006b). In the process described there, the average price was 
calculated by dividing the sum of the value of calcined and uncalcined petroleum coke exports 
by the sum of export quantities. We collected these data from the U.S. International Trade 
Commissions Database (USITC, 2007). To convert units to million

BTUs, we converted from metric tons to barrels by multiplying by 5.51, and we converted from 
barrels to million BTUs by multiplying by 6.024. 
To calculate fuel costs, we used the primary fuel used by the kiln reported by the Portland 
Cement Association (2004) and multiplied fuel prices by the fuel input equation described above. 
A.2.6 Results 
RTI used the methods described above to revise the kiln-level AVC functions and to 
reflect the cost differences across kiln technologies and kiln size. The new AVC estimates for 
each kiln are reported in Table A-14. We report them in dollars per metric ton and dollars per 
short ton. 
A.3 Partial Equilibrium Model 
Once the markets were defined, we examined the evidence supporting the appropriate 
supplier pricing behavior assumptions in these markets. For example, the degree of 
concentration, entry barriers, and product differentiation can indicate a firm’s ability to influence 
market prices by varying the quantity of cement it sells. In markets with large numbers of sellers 
and identical products, firms are unlikely to be able to influence market prices via their 
production decisions (i.e., they are “price takers”). However, in markets with few firms, 
significant barriers to entry (e.g., licenses, legal restrictions, or high fixed costs), or products that 
are similar but can be differentiated, the firm may have some degree of market power (i.e., set or 
significantly influence market prices).

Although perfect competition on the supply side (and demand side) is widely accepted 
for modeling many industries (EPA, 2000), the cement industry has unique characteristics that 
lead us to use an alternative assumption about supplier pricing behavior. First, high 
transportation costs and other production economics limit the number of sellers, so each seller 
has a substantial market share. Potential entry is constrained by the high capital costs that involve 
purchases and construction of large rotary kilns that are not readily movable or transferable to 
other uses. In addition, large plants are typically more economical because they can produce 
cement at lower unit costs; this reduces entry incentives for small-sized cement plants. Second, 
cement producers offer very similar or identical products. American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) specifications tend to ensure uniform quality, and recent industry reviews 
(USITC, 2006) suggest that there is little or no brand loyalty that allows firms to differentiate 
their products. Given this evidence, EPA continued to use the oligopoly framework used in 
previous economic analyses (EPA, 1998, 1999b).

 A-27 
One consequence of this assumption is that the seller individually chooses an output level 
that is less than the level produced under perfect competition. As a result, the baseline market 
price will be higher than a model of perfect competition, and there is a preexisting market 
distortion in the industry being regulated.1 To provide some intuition about factors that influence 
the size of the existing distortion, we express a seller’s “best” supply decision as a function of the 
market price, the seller’s market share, the market demand elasticity, and the seller’s marginal 
costs (see Varian [1992], pp. 289–290): 
Price × (1 + Market Sharei/Demand Elasticity) = Marginal Costi 
This equation shows the relationship between the oligopoly model and perfect competition. The 
market distortion will typically be higher the smaller the number of sellers and in markets where 
the quantity demanded is less sensitive to price (i.e., the demand elasticity is inelastic). 
A.4  Equations 
To estimate the economic impacts of the regulation, EPA used four linear equations to 
calculate the following unknown variables: 
 change in domestic plant production (dqi),  
 change in imports (dqimports),  
 change in cement market quantity (dQ), and 
 change in cement price (dP).  
Equation 1: Domestic Supply. For each plant, we describe its response to the regulatory 
program as follows. The total compliance cost per ton (ci) is applied to each kiln, and the 
difference in the highest cost kiln with-regulation and the highest cost kiln in the baseline 
approximates the plant’s change in the marginal cost of production (dMCi). In with-regulation 
equilibrium, the change in marginal revenue (dMRi) must equal the change in the marginal cost 
(dMCi) for each plant.2 
dmarginal Revenuei = dmarginal Costi 
or 
                                                 
1 This ultimately influence partial equilibrium model’s estimates of the social cost of the regulatory program since 
bigger existing market distortions tend tends to widen the gap between price and marginal cost in these markets 
and leads to the higher deadweight loss estimates than under the case of perfectly competitive markets. The 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) explicitly mentions the need to consider market power–related 
welfare costs in evaluating regulations under Executive Order 12866. 
2 To highlight and make transparent the assumptions regarding seller behavior, this equation is formally derived in 
Appendix B.

Equation 2: Supply of Imports. If applicable to the market, an equation describing the supply 
of cement from other countries was included:  
dimports = import supply elasticity × (dprice/baseline price) × baseline imports. 
For import supply, EPA used the latest empirical work on how other countries who export (i.e., 
supply imports) to the United States respond to price changes. Broda et al. (2008) report that the 
export supply elasticity for commodities imported by the United States was approximately two. 
This implies that a 1% increase in prices results in a 2% increase in the volume of exports for a 
typical good. 
Equation 3: Market Supply. Market supply of Portland cement equals the change in domestic 
production and imports: 
dmarket Q = dtotal domestic production + dimports. 
This condition ensures that the market quantity is consistent with the individual supply decisions 
of domestic plants and imports in the new with-regulation equilibrium for each regional market. 
Equation 4: Market Demand. The demand for Portland cement is derived from the demand for 
concrete products, which, in turn, is derived largely from the demand for construction. Based on 
a linear demand equation, the market demand condition for Portland cement must hold based on 
the projected change in market price, that is, 
dMarketQ = demand elasticity (dprice/baseline price) × baseline consumption. 
The use of published estimates from previous rulemakings is appropriate in cases when the cost 
of preparing original estimates is high (EPA, 2000). In previous analyses, EPA econometrically 
estimated the demand elasticity for cement and reported a point estimate of −0.88 (EPA, 1998). 
This value suggests that a 1% increase in the cement price would lead to a 0.88% reduction in 
cement consumption.

APPENDIX C 
SOCIAL COST METHODOLOGY 
 
 C-1 
The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has adopted the standard 
industry-level analysis described in the Office’s resource manual (EPA, 1999a). This approach is 
consistent with previous EPA analyses of the Portland cement industry (EPA, 1998; EPA, 
1999b) and uses a single-period static partial-equilibrium model to compare prepolicy cement 
market baselines with expected postpolicy outcomes in these markets. The benchmark time 
horizon for the analysis is the intermediate run where producers have some constraints on their 
flexibility to adjust factors of production. This time horizon allows us to capture important 
transitory impacts of the program on existing producers. The model provides an estimate of the 
social costs (changes in producer and consumer surplus) associated with controls applying to 
existing kilns (see Section 4). Since the social cost methodology is identical to the approach used 
in previous cement analysis (EPA, 1998, Appendix C), we have included elements of the 
previous report’s Appendix C in this RIA. 
Figure C-1 illustrates the conceptual framework for evaluating the social cost and 
distributive impacts under the imperfectly competitive structure of U.S. cement markets. The 
baseline equilibrium is given by the price, P0, and the quantity, Q0. Without the regulation, the 
total benefits of consuming cement are given by the area under the demand curve up to the 
market output, Q0. This equals the area filled by the letters ABCDEFGHIJ. The total variable 
cost to society of producing Q0 equals the area under the MC function, given by the area IJ. 
Thus, the total surplus value to society from the production and consumption of output level Q0 
equals the total benefits minus the total costs, or the area filled by the letters ABCDEFGH.  
This total surplus value to society can be further divided into producer surplus and 
consumer surplus. Producer surplus accrues to the suppliers of cement and reflects the value they 
receive in the market for producing Q0 units of cement less their costs of production, i.e., their 
profits. As shown in Figure C-1, producer surplus is given by the area DEFGH, which is the 
difference between cement revenues (i.e., area DEFGHIJ) and production costs (area IJ). 
Consumer surplus accrues to the consumers of cement and reflects the value they place on 
consumption (total benefits of consumption) less what they must pay on the market, i.e., P0. 
Consumer surplus is thereby given by the area ABC.

Figure C-1. Social Cost of Regulation Under Imperfect Competition 
 
The proposed rule will increase the marginal cost of producing cement and thereby shift 
this curve upward by the amount of the incremental compliance costs. As shown in Figure C-1, 
this results in a new market equilibrium that occurs at a higher market price for cement, P1, and a 
lower level of output, Q1. In this scenario, the total benefits of consumption are equal to area 
ABDFI and the total variable costs of production are equal to area FI. This yields a with-
regulation social surplus equal to area ABD with area BD representing the new producer surplus 
and area A being the new consumer surplus. The social cost of the regulation equals the total 
change in social surplus caused by the regulation. Therefore, the social cost of the regulation is 
represented by the area FGHEC in Figure C-1. 
The distributive effects are estimated by separating the social cost into producer surplus 
and consumer surplus losses. First, the change in producer surplus is given by 
 ΔPS = B – F – (G+H+E) (C.1) 
Producers gain B from the increase in price (a transfer from consumers to producers), but lose F 
from the increase in production costs due to the incremental compliance costs. Furthermore, the 
reduction of cement production leads to foregone baseline profits of G+H+E. 
 C-3 
The change in consumer surplus is given by 
 ΔCS = – (B + C) (C.2) 
This change results from the reduction in consumer surplus from the baseline value of ABC to 
the with-regulation value of A. In this case, consumers lose area B as a transfer to producers 
through the increase in the price they pay for the with-regulation level of cement consumption, 
while the reduction in cement consumption due to regulation leads to foregone baseline value of 
consumption equal to area C. 
The social cost or total change in social surplus can then be derived simply by adding the 
changes in producer and consumer surplus, i.e.,  
 Social Cost = ΔPS + ΔCS = – (F + G + H + E + C) (C.3) 
This estimate can be compared to the engineering estimate of incremental compliance cost to 
demonstrate the difference between these two estimates of social cost. The incremental 
compliance cost estimate is given by the area FGH, which is simply the constant cost per unit 
times the baseline output level of cement. The social cost estimate from Equation (C.3) above, 
however, exceeds the engineering estimate by the area EC. In other words, the incremental 
compliance cost estimate understates the social costs of the regulation. The reason for this 
follows directly from the imperfectly competitive structure of the markets for cement. A 
comparison with the outcome under perfect competition will assist in illustrating this point. 
Suppose that the MR curve in Figure C-1 was the demand function for a competitive 
market, rather than the marginal revenue function for an imperfectly competitive producer. 
Similarly, let the MC function be the aggregate supply function for all producers in the market. 
The market equilibrium is still determined at the intersection of MC and MR, but given the 
revised interpretation of MR as the competitive demand function, the baseline (competitive) 
market price, P0C, is now equal to MC and Q0 is now interpreted as the competitive level of 
cement demand. In this case, all social surplus goes to the consumer. This is because producers 
receive a price that just covers their costs of production.  
In the with-regulation perfectly competitive equilibrium, the market price would rise by 
the per unit control cost amount to P1c. The social cost of the regulation is given entirely by the 
loss in consumer surplus as given by area FG. As shown in Figure C-1, this estimate of social 
cost is less than the incremental compliance cost estimate (i.e., area FGH) so that the engineering 
 C-4 
estimate overstates the social cost of the regulation under perfect competition. The overstatement 
results from the fact that the incremental compliance costs are estimated based on the baseline 
market level of cement output. With regulation, output is projected to decline to Q1, so that the 
actual incremental compliance costs incurred by the industry are given by area F. Area G 
represents the foregone value of cement consumption to consumers, also referred to as the 
deadweight loss (analogous to area C under the imperfect competition scenario).  
In addition, the estimate of social cost under perfect competition is less than the estimate 
under imperfect competition by the area HEC, i.e.,  
 SCimp – SCperf = −[(F+G+H+E+C) – (F+G)] = −(H + E + C) (C.4) 
The difference between these two measures results from the fact that the price paid by consumers 
(i.e., marginal value to society for cement) exceeds the cost of producing cement (i.e., the 
marginal cost to society of producing cement). As shown in Figure C-1, this difference in social 
cost is equal to the area between the demand curve (D) and the marginal revenue curve (MR) 
that exist under imperfectly competitive market structure. This area does not exist under perfect 
competition because the MR curve is interpreted as the demand curve so that the price paid by 
consumers equals the marginal cost of producing cement. The pre-existing social inefficiency of 
imperfect competition is exacerbated as the regulation moves society further away from the 
socially optimal level of cement production, which results in social costs greater than the 
incremental compliance cost imposed on the cement industry.
