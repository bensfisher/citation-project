DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND 
HUMAN SERVICES 
Office of the Secretary 
45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 
RIN: 0991–AB57 
Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, 
Security, and Enforcement Rules 
Under the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical 
Health Act 
AGENCY: Office for Civil Rights, 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. 
SUMMARY: The Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS or ‘‘the 
Department’’) is issuing this notice of 
proposed rulemaking to modify the 
Standards for Privacy of Individually 
Identifiable Health Information (Privacy 
Rule), the Security Standards for the 
Protection of Electronic Protected 
Health Information (Security Rule), and 
the rules pertaining to Compliance and 
Investigations, Imposition of Civil 
Money Penalties, and Procedures for 
Hearings (Enforcement Rule) issued 
under the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). The purpose of these 
modifications is to implement recent 
statutory amendments under the Health 
Information Technology for Economic 
and Clinical Health Act (‘‘the HITECH 
Act’’ or ‘‘the Act’’), to strengthen the 
privacy and security protection of 
health information, and to improve the 
workability and effectiveness of these 
HIPAA Rules.

comment on the proposed rules. Persons 
interested in commenting on the 
provisions of the proposed rules can 
assist us by preceding discussion of any 
particular provision or topic with a 
citation to the section of the proposed 
rule being discussed. 
I. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
The regulatory modifications 
proposed below concern several sets of 
rules that implement the Administrative 
Simplification provisions of title II, 
subtitle F, of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104–191), which 
added a new part C to title XI of the 
Social Security Act (sections 1171–1179 
of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 
1320d–1320d–8). The Health 
Information Technology for Economic 
and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, 
which was enacted as title XIII of 
division A and title IV of division B of 
the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), 
Public Law 111–5, modifies certain 
provisions of the Social Security Act 
pertaining to the Administrative 
Simplification Rules (HIPAA Rules) and 
requires certain modifications to the 
HIPAA Rules themselves. 
A. HIPAA Administrative 
Simplification—Statutory Background 
The Administrative Simplification 
provisions of HIPAA provided for the 
establishment of national standards for 
the electronic transmission of certain 
health information, such as standards 
for certain health care transactions 
conducted electronically and code sets 
and unique health care identifiers for 
health care providers and employers. 
The Administrative Simplification 
provisions of HIPAA also required the 
establishment of national standards to 
protect the privacy and security of 
personal health information and 
established civil money and criminal 
penalties for violations of the 
Administrative Simplification 
provisions. The Administrative 
Simplification provisions of HIPAA 
apply to three types of entities, which 
are known as ‘‘covered entities’’: health 
care providers who conduct covered 
health care transactions electronically, 
health plans, and health care 
clearinghouses. 
B. HIPAA Administrative 
Simplification—Regulatory Background 
The rules proposed below concern the 
privacy and security standards issued 
pursuant to HIPAA, as well as the 
enforcement rules that implement 
HIPAA’s civil money penalty authority. 
The Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health 
Information, known as the ‘‘Privacy 
Rule,’’ were issued on December 28, 
2000, and amended on August 14, 2002. 
See 65 FR 82462, as amended at 67 FR 
53182. The Security Standards for the 
Protection of Electronic Protected 
Health Information, known as the 
‘‘Security Rule,’’ were issued on 
February 20, 2003. See 68 FR 8334. The 
Compliance and Investigations, 
Imposition of Civil Money Penalties, 
and Procedures for Hearings regulations, 
collectively known as the ‘‘Enforcement 
Rule,’’ were issued as an interim final 
rule on April 17, 2003 (68 FR 18895), 
and revised and issued as a final rule, 
following rulemaking, on February 16, 
2006 (71 FR 8390). 
The Privacy Rule protects individuals’ 
medical records and other individually

identifiable health information created 
or received by or on behalf of covered 
entities, known as ‘‘protected health 
information.’’ The Privacy Rule protects 
individuals’ health information by 
regulating the circumstances under 
which covered entities may use and 
disclose protected health information 
and by requiring covered entities to 
have safeguards in place to protect the 
privacy of the information. As part of 
these protections, covered entities are 
required to have contracts or other 
arrangements in place with business 
associates that perform functions for or 
provide services to the covered entity 
and that require access to protected 
health information to ensure that these 
business associates likewise protect the 
privacy of the health information. The 
Privacy Rule also gives individuals 
rights with respect to their protected 
health information, including rights to 
examine and obtain a copy of their 
health records and to request 
corrections. 
The Security Rule, which applies only 
to protected health information in 
electronic form, requires covered 
entities to implement certain 
administrative, physical, and technical 
safeguards to protect this electronic 
information. As with the Privacy Rule, 
the Security Rule requires covered 
entities to have contracts or other 
arrangements in place with their 
business associates that provide 
satisfactory assurances that the business 
associates will appropriately safeguard 
the electronic protected health 
information they receive, create, 
maintain, or transmit on behalf of the 
covered entities. 
The Enforcement Rule establishes 
rules governing the compliance 
responsibilities of covered entities with 
respect to cooperation in the 
enforcement process. It also provides 
rules governing the investigation by the 
Department of compliance by covered 
entities, both through the investigation 
of complaints and the conduct of 
compliance reviews. It establishes rules 
governing the process and grounds for 
establishing the amount of a civil money 
penalty where the Department has 
determined a covered entity has 
violated a requirement of a HIPAA Rule. 
Finally, the Enforcement Rule 
establishes rules governing the 
procedures for hearings and appeals 
where the covered entity challenges a 
violation determination. 
C. The HITECH Act—Statutory 
Background 
The HITECH Act, enacted on 
February 17, 2009, is designed to 
promote the widespread adoption and 
standardization of health information 
technology. Subtitle D of title XIII, 
entitled ‘‘Privacy,’’ supports this goal by 
adopting amendments designed to 
strengthen the privacy and security 
protections of health information 
established by HIPAA. These provisions 
include extending the applicability of 
certain of the Privacy and Security 
Rules’ requirements to the business 
associates of covered entities; requiring 
HIPAA covered entities and business 
associates to provide for notification of 
breaches of ‘‘unsecured protected health 
information’’; establishing new 
limitations on the use and disclosure of 
protected health information for 
marketing and fundraising purposes; 
prohibiting the sale of protected health 
information; requiring the consideration 
of a limited data set as the minimum 
necessary amount of information; and 
expanding individuals’ rights to access 
and receive an accounting of disclosures 
of their protected health information, 
and to obtain restrictions on certain 
disclosures of protected health 
information to health plans. In addition, 
subtitle D adopts provisions designed to 
strengthen and expand HIPAA’s 
enforcement provisions. We provide a 
brief overview of the relevant statutory 
provisions below. 
In the area of business associates, the 
Act makes a number of changes. First, 
section 13401 of the Act applies certain 
provisions of the Security Rule that 
apply to covered entities directly to 
their business associates and makes 
business associates liable for civil and 
criminal penalties for the failure to 
comply with these provisions. 
Similarly, section 13404 makes business 
associates of covered entities civilly and 
criminally liable under the Privacy Rule 
for making uses and disclosures of 
protected health information that do not 
comply with the terms of their business 
associate contracts. The Act also 
provides that the additional privacy and 
security requirements of subtitle D of 
the Act are applicable to business 
associates and that such requirements 
shall be incorporated into business 
associate contracts. Finally, section 
13408 of the Act requires that 
organizations that provide data 
transmission of protected health 
information to a covered entity or 
business associate and that require 
routine access to such information, such 
as Health Information Exchange 
Organizations, Regional Health 
Information Organizations, and E- 
prescribing Gateways, as well as 
vendors that contract with covered 
entities to offer personal health records 
to patients as part of the covered 
entities’ electronic health records, shall 
be treated as business associates for 
purposes of the HITECH Act and the 
HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and 
required to enter into business associate 
contracts. 
Section 13402 of the Act sets forth the 
breach notification provisions, requiring 
covered entities and business associates 
to provide notification following 
discovery of a breach of unsecured 
protected health information. 
Additionally, section 13407 of the Act, 
enforced by the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), applies similar 
breach notification provisions to 
vendors of personal health records and 
their third party service providers. 
Section 13405 of the Act requires the 
Department to modify certain Privacy 
Rule provisions. In particular, section 
13405 sets forth certain circumstances 
in which covered entities must comply 
with an individual’s request for 
restriction of disclosure of his or her 
protected health information, provides 
for covered entities to consider a limited 
data set as the minimum necessary for 
a particular use, disclosure, or request of 
protected health information, and 
requires the Secretary to issue guidance 
to address what constitutes minimum 
necessary under the Privacy Rule. 
Section 13405 also requires the 
Department to modify the Privacy Rule 
to require covered entities that use or 
maintain electronic health records to 
provide individuals, upon request, with 
an accounting of disclosures of 
protected health information through an 
electronic health record for treatment, 
payment, or health care operations; 
generally prohibits the sale of protected 
health information without a valid 
authorization from the individual; and 
strengthens an individual’s right to an 
electronic copy of their protected health 
information, where a covered entity 
uses or maintains an electronic health 
record. 
Section 13406 of the Act requires the 
Department to modify the marketing 
and fundraising provisions of the 
Privacy Rule. With respect to marketing, 
the Act requires authorizations for 
certain health-related communications, 
which are currently exempted from the 
definition of marketing, if the covered 
entity receives remuneration in 
exchange for making the 
communication. The Act also 
strengthens an individual’s right under 
the Privacy Rule to opt out of 
fundraising communications by 
requiring the Department to modify the 
Privacy Rule so that covered entities 
must provide individuals with a clear 
and conspicuous opportunity to opt out 
of receiving fundraising

1 We note that section 13421 of the HITECH Act 
and HIPAA’s State preemption provisions do not 
affect the applicability of other Federal law, such 
as the Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse 
Patient Records Regulation at 42 CFR Part 2, to a 
covered entity’s use or disclosure of health 
information. 
communications and by requiring that 
an opt out be treated as a revocation of 
authorization under the Privacy Rule. 
Section 13410 of the Act addresses 
enforcement in a number of ways. First, 
section 13410(a) provides that the 
Secretary’s authority to impose a civil 
money penalty will only be barred to 
the extent a criminal penalty has been 
imposed, rather than in cases in which 
the offense in question merely 
constitutes an offense criminally 
punishable. In addition, section 
13410(a) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to formally investigate any 
complaint where a preliminary 
investigation of the facts indicates a 
possible violation due to willful neglect 
and to impose a penalty where a 
violation is found in such cases. Section 
13410(c) of the Act provides, for 
purposes of enforcement, for the transfer 
to the HHS Office for Civil Rights of any 
civil money penalty or monetary 
settlement collected under the Privacy 
and Security Rules and also requires the 
Department to establish by regulation a 
methodology for distributing to harmed 
individuals a percentage of the civil 
money penalties and monetary 
settlements collected under the Privacy 
and Security Rules. Effective as of 
February 18, 2009, section 13410(d) of 
the Act also modified the civil money 
penalty structure for violations of the 
HIPAA Rules by implementing a tiered 
increase in the amount of penalties 
based on culpability. In addition, as of 
February 18, 2009, section 13410(e) of 
the Act also granted State Attorneys 
General the authority to enforce the 
HIPAA Rules by bringing civil actions 
on behalf of State residents in court. 
Section 13421 states that HIPAA’s 
State preemption provisions at 42 U.S.C. 
1320d–7 shall apply to the provisions of 
subtitle D of the HITECH Act in the 
same manner as they do to HIPAA’s 
provisions.1 Section 13423 of the Act 
provides a general effective date of 
February 18, 2010, for most of its 
provisions, except where a different 
effective date is otherwise provided. 
The Act also provides for the 
development of guidance, reports, and 
studies in a number of areas, including 
guidance on appropriate technical 
safeguards to implement the HIPAA 
Security Rule (section 13401(c)); for 
purposes of breach notification, 
guidance on the methods and 
technologies for rendering protected 
health information unusable, 
unreadable, or indecipherable to 
unauthorized individuals (section 
13402(h)); guidance on what constitutes 
the minimum necessary amount of 
information for purposes of the Privacy 
Rule (section 13405(b)); a report by the 
Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) regarding recommendations for a 
methodology under which harmed 
individuals may receive a percentage of 
civil money penalties and monetary 
settlements under the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules (section 13410(c)); a 
report to Congress on HIPAA Privacy 
and Security enforcement (section 
13424(a)); a study and report on the 
application of privacy and security 
requirements to non-HIPAA covered 
entities (section 13424(b)); guidance on 
de-identification (section 13424(c)); and 
a study on the Privacy Rule’s definition 
of ‘‘psychotherapy notes’’ at 45 CFR 
164.501, with regard to including test 
data that is related to direct responses, 
scores, items, forms, protocols, manuals, 
or other materials that are part of a 
mental health evaluation (section 
13424(f)). 
Finally, the Act includes provisions 
for education by HHS on health 
information privacy and for periodic 
audits by the Secretary. Section 
13403(a) provides for the Secretary to 
designate HHS regional office privacy 
advisors to offer guidance and education 
to covered entities, business associates, 
and individuals on their rights and 
responsibilities related to Federal 
privacy and security requirements for 
protected health information. Section 
13403(b) requires the HHS Office for 
Civil Rights, not later than 12 months 
after enactment, to develop and 
maintain a multi-faceted national 
education initiative to enhance public 
transparency regarding the uses of 
protected health information, including 
programs to educate individuals about 
potential uses of their protected health 
information, the effects of such uses, 
and the rights of individuals with 
respect to such uses. Section 13411 
requires the Secretary to provide for 
periodic audits to ensure covered 
entities and business associates comply 
with the applicable requirements of the 
HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. 
We discuss many of the Act’s 
statutory provisions in more detail 
below where we describe section-by- 
section how these proposed regulations 
would implement those provisions of 
the Act. However, we do not discuss in 
detail the breach notification provisions 
in sections 13402 of the Act or the 
modified civil money penalty structure 
in section 13410(d) of the Act, which as 
explained below, have been the subject 
of previous rulemakings. In addition, we 
do not address in this rulemaking the 
accounting for disclosures requirement 
in section 13405 of the Act, which is 
tied to the adoption of a standard under 
the HITECH Act at subtitle A of title XIII 
of ARRA, or the penalty distribution 
methodology requirement in section 
13410(c) of the Act, which is to be based 
on the recommendations noted above to 
be developed at a later date by the GAO. 
These provisions will be the subject of 
future rulemakings. Further, we clarify 
that we are not issuing regulations with 
respect to the new authority of the State 
Attorneys General to enforce the HIPAA 
Rules. Finally, other than the guidance 
required by section 13405(b) of the Act 
with respect to what constitutes 
minimum necessary, this proposed rule 
does not address the studies, reports, 
guidance, audits, or education efforts 
required by the HITECH Act. 
D. The HITECH Act—Regulatory 
Background 
As noted above, certain of the 
HITECH Act’s privacy and security 
provisions have already been the subject 
of rulemakings and related actions. In 
particular, the Department published 
interim final regulations to implement 
the breach notification provisions at 
section 13402 of the Act for HIPAA 
covered entities and business associates 
in the Federal Register on August 24, 
2009 (74 FR 42740), effective September 
23, 2009. Similarly, the FTC published 
final regulations implementing the 
breach notification provisions at section 
13407 for personal health record 
vendors and their third party service 
providers on August 25, 2009 (74 FR 
42962), effective September 24, 2009. 
For purposes of determining to what 
information the HHS and FTC breach 
notification regulations apply, the 
Department also issued, first on April 
17, 2009 (published in the Federal 
Register on April 27, 2009, 74 FR 
19006), and then later with its interim 
final rule, the guidance required by the 
HITECH Act under 13402(h) specifying 
the technologies and methodologies that 
render protected health information 
unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable 
to unauthorized individuals. In 
addition, to conform the provisions of 
the Enforcement Rule to the new tiered 
and increased civil money penalty 
structure made effective by the HITECH 
Act on the day after enactment, or 
February 18, 2009, the Department 
published an interim final rule on 
October 30, 2009 (74 FR 56123), 
effective November 30, 2009.

40871 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
II. General Issues 
A. Effective and Compliance Dates 
As noted above, section 13423 of the 
Act provides that the provisions in 
subtitle D took effect one year after 
enactment, i.e., on February 18, 2010, 
except as specified otherwise. There are 
a number of exceptions to this general 
rule. Some provisions were effective the 
day after enactment, i.e., February 18, 
2009. For example, the tiered and 
increased civil money penalty 
provisions of section 13410(d) were 
effective for violations occurring after 
the date of enactment. Sections 13402 
and 13407 of the Act regarding breach 
notification required interim final rules 
within 180 days of enactment, with 
effective dates 30 days after the 
publication of such rules. Other 
provisions of the Act have later effective 
dates. For example, the provision at 
section 13410(a)(1) of the Act providing 
that the Secretary’s authority to impose 
a civil money penalty will only be 
barred to the extent a criminal penalty 
has been imposed, rather than in cases 
in which the offense in question merely 
constitutes an offense that is criminally 
punishable, becomes effective for 
violations occurring on or after February 
18, 2011. The rules proposed below 
generally pertain to the statutory 
provisions that became effective on 
February 18, 2010, or, in a few cases, on 
a later date. 
We note that the final rule will not 
take effect until after most of the 
provisions of the HITECH Act became 
effective on February 18, 2010. We 
recognize that it will be difficult for 
covered entities and business associates 
to comply with the statutory provisions 
until after we have finalized our 
changes to the HIPAA Rules. In 
addition, we recognize that covered 
entities and business associates will 
need some time beyond the effective 
date of the final rule to come into 
compliance with the final rule’s 
provisions. In light of these 
considerations, we intend to provide 
covered entities and business associates 
with 180 days beyond the effective date 
of the final rule to come into 
compliance with most of the rule’s 
provisions. We believe that providing a 
180-day compliance period best 
comports with section 1175(b)(2) of the 
Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d–4, 
and our implementing provision at 45 
CFR 160.104(c)(1), which require the 
Secretary to provide at least a 180-day 
period for covered entities to comply 
with modifications to standards and 
implementation specifications in the 
HIPAA Rules. While the Social Security 
Act and the HIPAA Rules permit the 
Secretary to further delay the 
compliance date for small health plans, 
we do not believe that it is necessary to 
do so for this rule both because most of 
the changes being proposed are discrete 
modifications to existing requirements 
of the HIPAA Rules, as well as because 
the Department is proposing an 
additional one-year transition period to 
modify certain business associate 
agreements, which should provide 
sufficient relief to all covered entities, 
including small health plans. The 
Department welcomes comment on the 
assumption that it is not necessary to 
extend the compliance date for small 
health plans. 
We also expect that for future 
modifications to the HIPAA Rules, in 
most cases, a 180-day compliance 
period will suffice. Accordingly, we 
propose to add a provision at § 160.105 
to address the compliance date 
generally for implementation of new or 
modified standards in the HIPAA Rules. 
Proposed § 160.105 would provide that 
with respect to new standards or 
implementation specifications or 
modifications to standards or 
implementation specifications in the 
HIPAA Rules, except as otherwise 
provided, covered entities and business 
associates must comply with the 
applicable new standards or 
implementation specifications or 
modifications to standards or 
implementation specifications no later 
than 180 days from the effective date of 
any such change. Where future 
modifications to the HIPAA Rules 
necessitate a longer compliance period, 
we would provide so accordingly in the 
regulatory text. We propose to retain the 
compliance date provisions at 
§§ 164.534 and 164.318, which provide 
the compliance dates of April 14, 2003, 
and April 20, 2005, for initial 
implementation of the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules, respectively, for 
historical purposes only. 
We note that proposed § 160.105 
regarding the compliance date of new or 
modified standards or implementation 
specifications would not apply to 
modifications to the provisions of the 
HIPAA Enforcement Rule because such 
provisions are not standards or 
implementation specifications (as the 
terms are defined at § 160.103). Such 
provisions are in effect and apply at the 
time the final rule becomes effective or 
as otherwise specifically provided. We 
also note that our proposed general rule 
for a 180-day compliance period for new 
or modified standards would not apply 
where we expressly provide a different 
compliance period in the regulation for 
one or more provisions. For purposes of 
this proposed rule, this would mean 
that the 180-day compliance period 
would not govern the time period 
required to modify those business 
associate agreements that qualify for the 
longer transition period proposed in 
§ 164.532. We seek comments on any 
potential unintended consequences of 
establishing a 180-day compliance date 
as a regulatory default, with the noted 
exceptions. 
B. Other Proposed Changes 
While passage of the HITECH Act 
necessitates much of the rulemaking 
below, it does not account for all of the 
proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy, 
Security, and Enforcement Rules 
encompassed in this rulemaking. The 
Department is taking this opportunity to 
improve the workability and 
effectiveness of all three sets of HIPAA 
Rules. The Privacy Rule has not been 
amended since 2002, and the Security 
Rule has not been amended since 2003. 
While the Enforcement Rule was 
amended in the October 30, 2009, 
interim final rule to incorporate the 
enforcement-related HITECH statutory 
changes that are already effective, it has 
not been otherwise substantively 
amended since 2006. In the intervening 
years, HHS has accumulated a wealth of 
experience with these rules, both from 
public contact in various forums and 
through the process of enforcing the 
rules. In addition, we have identified a 
number of needed technical corrections 
to the rules. Accordingly, we propose a 
number of modifications that we believe 
will eliminate ambiguities in the rules 
and/or make them more workable and 
effective. Further, we propose a few 
modifications to conform the HIPAA 
Privacy Rule to provisions in the Patient 
Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 
2005 (PSQIA). We address the 
substantive proposed changes in the 
section-by-section description of the 
proposed rule below. Technical 
corrections are discussed at the end of 
the section-by-section description of the 
other proposed amendments to the 
rules. 
III. Section-by-Section Description of 
the Proposed Amendments to Subparts 
A and B of Part 160 
Subpart A of part 160 of the HIPAA 
Rules contains general provisions that 
apply to all of the HIPAA Rules. Subpart 
B of part 160 contains the regulatory 
provisions implementing HIPAA’s 
preemption provisions. We propose to 
amend a number of these provisions. 
Some of the proposed changes are 
necessitated by the statutory changes 
made by the HITECH Act, while others 
are of a technical or conforming nature.

40872 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
A. Subpart A—General Provisions, 
Section 160.101—Statutory Basis and 
Purpose 
This section sets out the statutory 
basis and purpose of the HIPAA Rules. 
We propose a technical change to 
include a reference to the provisions of 
the HITECH Act upon which most of the 
regulatory changes proposed below are 
based. 
B. Subpart A—General Provisions, 
Section 160.102—Applicability 
This section sets out to whom the 
HIPAA Rules apply. We propose to add 
a new paragraph (b) to make clear, 
consistent with the provisions of the 
HITECH Act that are discussed more 
fully below, that the standards, 
requirements, and implementation 
specifications of the subchapter apply to 
business associates, where so provided. 
C. Subpart A—General Provisions, 
Section 160.103—Definitions 
Section 160.103 contains definitions 
of terms that appear throughout the 
HIPAA Rules. For ease of reference, we 
propose to move several definitions 
currently found at § 160.302 to 
§ 160.103 without substantive change to 
the definitions themselves. This 
category includes definitions of the 
following terms: ‘‘ALJ,’’ ‘‘civil money 
penalty,’’ and ‘‘violation or violate.’’ As 
the removal of these definitions, along 
with the removal of other definitions 
discussed below (e.g., ‘‘administrative 
simplification provision’’ and 
‘‘respondent’’), would leave § 160.302 
unpopulated, we propose to reserve that 
section. We also propose to remove a 
comma from the definition of 
‘‘disclosure’’ inadvertently inserted into 
the definition in a prior rulemaking, 
which is not intended as a substantive 
change to the definition. In addition, we 
propose to replace the term 
‘‘individually identifiable health 
information’’ with ‘‘protected health 
information’’ in the definition of 
‘‘standard’’ to better reflect the scope of 
the Privacy and Security Rules. Further, 
we propose the following definitional 
changes: 
1. Definition of ‘‘Administrative 
Simplification Provision’’ 
This definition is currently located in 
the definitions section of subpart C of 
part 160 of the HIPAA Enforcement 
Rule. We propose to remove the 
definition of this term from § 160.302 
and move it to the definitions section 
located at § 160.103 for clarity and 
convenience, as the term is used 
repeatedly throughout the entire part 
160. We also propose to add to the 
definition a reference to sections 13400– 
13424 of the HITECH Act. 
2. Definition of ‘‘Business Associate’’ 
Sections 164.308(b) of the Security 
Rule and 164.502(e) of the Privacy Rule 
require a covered entity to enter into a 
contract or other written agreement or 
arrangement with its business 
associates. The purpose of these 
contracts or other arrangements, 
generally known as business associate 
agreements, is to provide some legal 
protection when protected health 
information is being handled by another 
person (a natural person or legal entity) 
on behalf of a covered entity. The 
HIPAA Rules define ‘‘business 
associate’’ generally to mean a person 
who performs functions or activities on 
behalf of, or certain services for, a 
covered entity that involve the use or 
disclosure of protected health 
information. Examples of business 
associates include third party 
administrators or pharmacy benefit 
managers for health plans, claims 
processing or billing companies, 
transcription companies, and persons 
who perform legal, actuarial, 
accounting, management, or 
administrative services for covered 
entities and who require access to 
protected health information. We 
propose a number of modifications to 
the definition of ‘‘business associate.’’ In 
particular, we propose to modify the 
definition to conform the term to the 
statutory provisions of PSQIA, 42 U.S.C. 
299b–21, et seq., and the HITECH Act. 
Additional modifications are made for 
the purpose of clarifying circumstances 
when a business associate relationship 
exists and for general clarification of the 
definition. 
a. Inclusion of Patient Safety 
Organizations 
We propose to add patient safety 
activities to the list of functions and 
activities a person may undertake on 
behalf of a covered entity that give rise 
to a business associate relationship. 
PSQIA, at 42 U.S.C. 299b–22(i)(1), 
provides that Patient Safety 
Organizations (PSOs) must be treated as 
business associates when applying the 
Privacy Rule. PSQIA provides for the 
establishment of PSOs to receive reports 
of patient safety events or concerns from 
providers and provide analyses of 
events to reporting providers. A 
reporting provider may be a HIPAA 
covered entity and, thus, information 
reported to a PSO may include 
protected health information that the 
PSO may analyze on behalf of the 
covered provider. The analysis of such 
information is a patient safety activity 
for purposes of PSQIA and the Patient 
Safety Rule, 42 CFR 3.10, et seq. While 
the HIPAA Rules as written would 
encompass a PSO as a business 
associate when the PSO was performing 
quality analyses and other activities on 
behalf of a covered health care provider, 
we propose this change to the definition 
of business associate to more clearly 
align the HIPAA and Patient Safety 
Rules. 
We note that in some cases a covered 
health care provider, such as a public or 
private hospital, may have a component 
PSO that performs patient safety 
activities on behalf of the health care 
provider. See 42 CFR 3.20. In such 
cases, the component PSO would not be 
a business associate of the covered 
entity but rather the persons performing 
patient safety activities would be 
workforce members of the covered 
entity. However, if the component PSO 
contracts out some of its patient safety 
activities to a third party, the third party 
would be a business associate of the 
covered entity. In addition, if a 
component PSO of one covered entity 
performs patient safety activities for 
another covered entity, such component 
PSO would be a business associate of 
the other covered entity. 
b. Inclusion of Health Information 
Organizations (HIO), E–Prescribing 
Gateways, and Other Persons That 
Facilitate Data Transmission; as Well as 
Vendors of Personal Health Records 
Section 13408 of the HITECH Act, 
which became effective on February 18, 
2010, provides that an organization, 
such as a Health Information Exchange 
Organization, E-prescribing Gateway, or 
Regional Health Information 
Organization, that provides data 
transmission of protected health 
information to a covered entity (or its 
business associate) and that requires 
access on a routine basis to such 
protected health information must be 
treated as a business associate for 
purposes of the Act and the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Rules. Section 
13408 also provides that a vendor that 
contracts with a covered entity to allow 
the covered entity to offer a personal 
health record to patients as part of the 
covered entity’s electronic health record 
shall be treated as a business associate. 
Section 13408 requires that such 
organizations and vendors enter into a 
written business associate contract or 
other arrangement with the covered 
entity in accordance with the HIPAA 
Rules. 
In accordance with the Act, we 
propose to modify the definition of 
‘‘business associate’’ to explicitly 
designate these persons as business

40873 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
2 Department of Health and Human Services, 
Office of the National Coordinator for Health 
Information Technology, The National Alliance for 
Health Information Technology Report to the Office 
of the National Coordinator For Health Information 
Technology: Defining Key Health Information 
Terms, Pg. 24 (2008). 
3 Id. at 25. 
associates. Under proposed paragraphs 
(3)(i) and (ii) of the definition, the term 
‘‘business associate’’ would include: (1) 
A Health Information Organization, E- 
prescribing Gateway, or other person 
that provides data transmission services 
with respect to protected health 
information to a covered entity and that 
requires routine access to such 
protected health information; and (2) a 
person who offers a personal health 
record to one or more individuals on 
behalf of a covered entity. 
Section 13408 of the Act makes 
reference to Health Information 
Exchange Organizations; however, we 
instead include in the proposed 
definition the term ‘‘Health Information 
Organization’’ because it is our 
understanding that ‘‘Health Information 
Organization’’ is the more widely 
recognized and accepted term to 
describe an organization that oversees 
and governs the exchange of health- 
related information among 
organizations.2 Section 13408 of the Act 
also specifically refers to Regional 
Health Information Organizations. 
However, we do not believe the 
inclusion of the term in the definition 
of ‘‘business associate’’ is necessary as a 
Regional Health Information 
Organization is simply a Health 
Information Organization that governs 
health information exchange among 
organizations within a defined 
geographic area.3 Further, the specific 
terms of ‘‘Health Information 
Organization’’ and ‘‘E-prescribing 
Gateway’’ are merely illustrative of the 
types of organizations that would fall 
within this paragraph of the definition 
of ‘‘business associate.’’ We request 
comment on the use of these terms 
within the definition and whether 
additional clarifications or additions are 
necessary. 
Section 13408 also provides that the 
data transmission organizations that the 
Act requires to be treated as business 
associates are those that require access 
to protected health information on a 
routine basis. Conversely, data 
transmission organizations that do not 
require access to protected health 
information on a routine basis would 
not be treated as business associates. 
This is consistent with our prior 
interpretation of the definition of 
‘‘business associate,’’ through which we 
have indicated that entities that act as 
mere conduits for the transport of 
protected health information but do not 
access the information other than on a 
random or infrequent basis are not 
business associates. See http:// 
www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/faq/ 
providers/business/245.html. In 
contrast, however, entities that manage 
the exchange of protected health 
information through a network, 
including providing patient locator 
services and performing various 
oversight and governance functions for 
electronic health information exchange, 
have more than ‘‘random’’ access to 
protected health information and thus, 
would fall within the definition of 
‘‘business associate.’’ 
c. Inclusion of Subcontractors 
We propose to add language in 
paragraph (3)(iii) of the definition of 
‘‘business associate’’ to provide that 
subcontractors of a covered entity—i.e., 
those persons that perform functions for 
or provide services to a business 
associate, other than in the capacity as 
a member of the business associate’s 
workforce, are also business associates 
to the extent that they require access to 
protected health information. We also 
propose to include a definition of 
‘‘subcontractor’’ in § 160.103 to make 
clear that a subcontractor is a person 
who acts on behalf of a business 
associate, other than in the capacity of 
a member of the workforce of such 
business associate. Even though we use 
the term ‘‘subcontractor,’’ which implies 
there is a contract in place between the 
parties, we note that the definition 
would apply to an agent or other person 
who acts on behalf of the business 
associate, even if the business associate 
has failed to enter into a business 
associate contract with the person. We 
request comment on the use of the term 
‘‘subcontractor’’ and its proposed 
definition. 
The proposed modifications are 
similar in structure and effect to the 
Privacy Rule’s initial extension of 
privacy protections from covered 
entities to business associates through 
contract requirements to protect 
downstream protected health 
information. The proposed provisions 
avoid having privacy and security 
protections for protected health 
information lapse merely because a 
function is performed by an entity that 
is a subcontractor rather than an entity 
with a direct relationship with a 
covered entity. Allowing such a lapse in 
privacy and security protections may 
allow business associates to avoid 
liability imposed upon them by sections 
13401 and 13404 of the Act, thus 
circumventing the congressional intent 
underlying these provisions. The 
proposed definition of ‘‘subcontractor’’ 
also is consistent with Congress’ overall 
concern that the privacy and security 
protections of the HIPAA Rules extend 
beyond covered entities to those entities 
that create or receive protected health 
information in order for the covered 
entity to perform its health care 
functions. For example, as discussed 
above, section 13408 makes explicit that 
certain types of entities providing 
services to covered entities—e.g., 
vendors of personal health records— 
shall be considered business associates. 
Therefore, consistent with Congress’ 
intent in sections 13401 and 13404 of 
the Act, as well as its overall concern 
that the HIPAA Rules extent beyond 
covered entities to those entities that 
create or receive protected health 
information, we propose that 
downstream entities that work at the 
direction of or on behalf of a business 
associate and handle protected health 
information would also be required to 
comply with the applicable Privacy and 
Security Rule provisions in the same 
manner as the primary business 
associate, and likewise would incur 
liability for acts of noncompliance. We 
note, and further explain below, that 
this proposed modification would not 
require the covered entity to have a 
contract with the subcontractor; rather, 
the obligation would remain on each 
business associate to obtain satisfactory 
assurances in the form of a written 
contract or other arrangement that a 
subcontractor will appropriately 
safeguard protected health information. 
For example, under this proposal, if a 
business associate, such as a third party 
administrator, hires a company to 
handle document and media shredding 
to securely dispose of paper and 
electronic protected health information, 
then the shredding company would be 
directly required to comply with the 
applicable requirements of the HIPAA 
Security Rule (e.g., with respect to 
proper disposal of electronic media) and 
the Privacy Rule (e.g., with respect to 
limiting its uses and disclosures of the 
protected health information in 
accordance with its contract with the 
business associate). 
d. Exceptions to Business Associate 
We also propose to move the 
provisions at §§ 164.308(b)(2) and 
164.502(e)(1)(ii) to the definition of 
business associate. These provisions 
provide that in certain circumstances, 
such as when a covered entity discloses 
protected health information to a health 
care provider concerning the treatment 
of an individual, a covered entity is not 
required to enter into a business

associate contract or other arrangement 
with the recipient of the protected 
health information. While we do not 
change the meaning of these provisions, 
we believe these limitations on the 
scope of ‘‘business associate’’ are more 
appropriately placed in the definition as 
exceptions to the term to make clear that 
the Department does not consider the 
recipients of the protected health 
information in these circumstances to be 
business associates. The movement of 
these exceptions and refinement of the 
definition of ‘‘business associate’’ also 
would help clarify that a person is a 
business associate if it meets the 
definition of ‘‘business associate,’’ even 
if a covered entity, or business associate 
with respect to a subcontractor, fails to 
enter into the required contract with the 
business associate. 
e. Technical Changes to the Definition 
For clarity and consistency, we also 
propose to change the term 
‘‘individually identifiable health 
information’’ in the current definition of 
‘‘business associate’’ to ‘‘protected health 
information,’’ since a business associate 
has no obligations under the HIPAA 
Rules with respect to individually 
identifiable health information that is 
not protected health information. 
3. Definition of ‘‘Compliance Date’’ 
The term ‘‘compliance date’’ currently 
refers only to covered entities. We 
propose a technical change to include 
business associates in the term, in light 
of the HITECH Act amendments, which 
apply certain provisions of the HIPAA 
Rules to business associates. 
4. Definition of ‘‘Electronic Media’’ 
The term ‘‘electronic media’’ was 
originally defined in the Transactions 
and Code Sets Rule issued on August 
17, 2000 (65 FR 50312) and was 
included in the definitions at § 162.103. 
That definition was subsequently 
revised and moved to § 160.103. The 
purpose of the revision was to clarify 
that— 
the physical movement of electronic media 
from place to place is not limited to magnetic 
tape, disk, or compact disk. This clarification 
removes a restriction as to what is considered 
to be physical electronic media, thereby 
allowing for future technological innovation. 
We further clarified that transmission of 
information not in electronic form before the 
transmission, for example, paper or voice, is 
not covered by this definition. 
68 FR 8339, Feb. 20, 2003. 
We propose to revise the definition of 
‘‘electronic media’’ in the following 
ways. First, we would revise paragraph 
(1) of the definition to conform it to 
current usage, as set forth in ‘‘Guidelines 
for Media Sanitization’’ (Definition of 
Medium, NIST SP 800–88, Glossary B, 
p. 27 (2006)). The NIST definition, 
which was updated subsequent to the 
issuance of the Privacy and Security 
Rules, was developed in recognition of 
the likelihood that the evolution of 
development of new technology would 
make use of the term ‘‘electronic storage 
media’’ obsolete in that there may be 
‘‘storage material’’ other than ‘‘media’’ 
that house electronic data. Second, we 
would add to paragraph (2) of the 
definition of ‘‘electronic media’’ a 
reference to intranets, to clarify that 
intranets come within the definition. 
Third, we propose to change the word 
‘‘because’’ to ‘‘if’’ in the final sentence of 
paragraph (2) of the definition of 
‘‘electronic media.’’ The definition 
assumed that no transmissions made by 
voice via telephone existed in electronic 
form before transmission; the evolution 
of technology has made this assumption 
obsolete. This modification would 
extend the policy described in the 
preamble discussion quoted above, but 
correct its application to current 
technology, where some voice 
technology is digitally produced from 
an information system and transmitted 
by phone. 
5. Definition of ‘‘Protected Health 
Information’’ 
We propose to modify the definition 
of ‘‘protected health information’’ at 
§ 160.103 to provide that the Privacy 
and Security Rules do not protect the 
individually identifiable health 
information of persons who have been 
deceased for more than 50 years. This 
proposed modification is explained 
more fully below in Section VI.E. of the 
preamble where we discuss the 
proposed changes to the Privacy Rule 
related to the protected health 
information of decedents. 
6. Definition of ‘‘Respondent’’ 
The definition of the term 
‘‘Respondent,’’ which is currently in 
§ 160.302, would be moved to § 160.103. 
A reference to ‘‘business associate’’ 
would be added following the reference 
to ‘‘covered entity’’ in recognition of the 
potential liability imposed on business 
associates for violations of certain 
provisions of the Privacy and Security 
Rules by sections 13401 and 13404 of 
the Act. 
7. Definition of ‘‘State’’ 
The HITECH Act at section 13400, 
which became effective February 18, 
2010, includes a definition of ‘‘State’’ to 
mean ‘‘each of the several States, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the 
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, 
and the Northern Mariana Islands.’’ This 
definition varies from paragraph (2) of 
the HIPAA definition of ‘‘State’’ at 
§ 160.103, which does not include 
reference to American Samoa and the 
Northern Mariana Islands. Thus, for 
consistency with the definition applied 
to the HIPAA Rules by the HITECH Act, 
we propose to add reference to 
American Samoa and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands in paragraph (2) of the definition 
of ‘‘State’’ at § 160.103. 
8. Definition of ‘‘Workforce’’ 
The HITECH Act is directly 
applicable to business associates and 
has extended liability for compliance 
with certain provisions of the Privacy 
and Security Rules to business 
associates. Because some provisions of 
the Act and the Privacy and Security 
Rules place obligations on the business 
associate with respect to workforce 
members, we propose to revise the 
definition of ‘‘workforce member’’ in 
§ 160.103 to make clear that such term 
includes the employees, volunteers, 
trainees, and other persons whose 
conduct, in the performance of work for 
a business associate, is under the direct 
control of the business associate. 
D. Subpart B—Preemption of State Law, 
Section 160.201—Statutory Basis 
We propose to modify § 160.201 
regarding the statutory basis for the 
preemption of State law provisions to 
add a reference to section 264(c) of 
HIPAA, which contains the statutory 
basis for the exception to preemption at 
§ 160.203(b) for State laws that are more 
stringent than the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
We also propose to add a reference to 
section 13421(a) of the HITECH Act, 
which applies HIPAA’s preemption 
rules to the HITECH Act’s privacy and 
security provisions. Finally, we propose 
to re-title the provision to read 
‘‘Statutory basis’’ instead of 
‘‘Applicability.’’ 
We also take this opportunity to make 
clear that section 264(c)(2) of HIPAA 
and § 160.203(b) do not create a Federal 
evidentiary privilege. Additionally, we 
take this opportunity to make clear that 
neither the HIPAA statute nor its 
implementing regulations give effect to 
State physician-patient privilege laws or 
provisions of State law relating to the 
privacy of individually identifiable 
health information for use in Federal 
court proceedings. Therefore, consistent 
with the Supremacy Clause, any State 
law that was preempted prior to HIPAA 
because of conflicts with a Federal law 
would continue to be preempted. 
Nothing in HIPAA or its implementing 
regulations is intended to expand the

scope of State laws, regardless of 
whether they are more or less stringent 
than Federal law. 
E. Subpart B—Preemption of State Law, 
Section 160.202—Definitions. 
1. Definition of ‘‘Contrary’’ 
The term ‘‘contrary’’ is currently 
defined in § 160.202 to make clear when 
the preemption provisions of HIPAA 
apply to State law. Consistent with the 
limited application of the HIPAA 
provisions to covered entities only, the 
current definition of the term ‘‘contrary’’ 
does not include reference to business 
associates. However, section 13421(a) of 
the HITECH Act provides that the 
HIPAA preemption provision (section 
1178 of the Social Security Act) applies 
to the provisions and requirements 
under the HITECH Act ‘‘in the same 
manner’’ as it would apply under the 
HIPAA provisions. Thus, the 
preemption provisions would apply to 
business associates, who are now, by 
virtue of the HITECH Act, required to 
comply with certain provisions of the 
HIPAA Rules and are subject to 
penalties for noncompliance, as 
discussed elsewhere. Thus, we propose 
to amend the definition of ‘‘contrary’’ by 
inserting references to business 
associates in paragraph (1) of the 
definition. We also expand the reference 
to the HITECH statutory provisions in 
paragraph (2) of the definition to 
encompass all of the sections of subtitle 
D of the HITECH Act, rather than merely 
to section 13402, which was added by 
the breach notifications regulations. 
These changes would give effect to 
section 13421(a). 
2. Definition of ‘‘More Stringent’’ 
The term ‘‘more stringent’’ is part of 
the statutory preemption language 
under HIPAA. HIPAA preempts State 
law that is contrary to a HIPAA privacy 
standard unless, among other 
exceptions, the State law is more 
stringent than the contrary HIPAA 
privacy standard. The current regulatory 
definition of ‘‘more stringent’’ does not 
include business associates. We propose 
to amend the definition to add a 
reference to business associates, for the 
reasons set out in the preceding 
discussion. 
IV. Section-by-Section Description of 
the Proposed Amendments to the 
Enforcement Rule—Subparts C and D of 
Part 160 
Section 13410 of the HITECH Act 
made several amendments that directly 
impact the Enforcement Rule, which 
applies to the Secretary’s enforcement of 
all of the HIPAA Administrative 
Simplification Rules, as well as the 
recently promulgated Breach 
Notification Rule. We issued an interim 
final rule on October 30, 2009, 74 FR 
56123, to address the HITECH Act 
amendments impacting the Enforcement 
Rule that became effective on February 
18, 2009. For context, we describe those 
modifications to the Enforcement Rule 
briefly below. We then provide a 
section-by-section description of the 
other section 13410 amendments that 
are part of this proposed rule. 
In addition, sections 13401 and 13404 
of the HITECH Act impose direct civil 
money penalty liability on business 
associates for violations of the HITECH 
Act and certain Privacy and Security 
Rule provisions. In doing so, sections 
13401(b) and 13404(c) of the Act 
provide that section 1176 of the Social 
Security Act shall apply to a violation 
by a business associate ‘‘in the same 
manner’’ as it would apply to a covered 
entity with respect to such a violation. 
Both provisions are, by virtue of section 
13423, effective February 18, 2010. 
The provisions of subparts C and D of 
part 160 currently apply by their terms 
solely to covered entities. Accordingly, 
to implement sections 13401(b) and 
13404(c) of the Act, we propose to 
revise a number of provisions in both 
subparts to reflect this statutory change 
by adding the term ‘‘business associate’’ 
where appropriate, following a reference 
to ‘‘covered entity.’’ For ease, we list the 
sections in which the term ‘‘business 
associate’’ is added here rather than 
repeat the change in each discussion of 
the sections below: §§ 160.300; 160.304; 
160.306(a) and (c); 160.308; 160.310; 
160.312; 160.316; 160.401; 160.402; 
160.404(b); 160.406; 160.408(c) and (d); 
and 160.410(a) and (c). 
In addition to these references, we 
propose to add a paragraph in 
§ 160.402(c)(2) to describe a business 
associate’s liability for the actions of its 
agents, in accordance with the Federal 
common law of agency. This proposed 
modification is discussed more fully 
below in the discussion of § 160.402(c). 
As noted above, the Department 
issued an interim final rule (IFR) on 
October 30, 2009, revising the 
Enforcement Rule to incorporate the 
provisions required by section 13410(d) 
of the HITECH Act that immediately 
took effect: Four categories of violations 
that reflect increasing levels of 
culpability, the corresponding tiers of 
civil money penalty amounts, and the 
revised limitations placed on the 
Secretary’s authority to impose 
penalties. More specifically, the IFR 
revised subpart D of the Enforcement 
Rule to transfer the definitions of 
‘‘reasonable cause,’’ ‘‘reasonable 
diligence,’’ and ‘‘willful neglect’’ from 
§ 160.410(a) to a new definitions section 
at § 160.401. The IFR revised § 160.404 
to incorporate, for violations occurring 
on or after February 18, 2009, the new 
penalty scheme required by section 
13410(d), as follows: For violations in 
which it is established that the covered 
entity did not know and, by exercising 
reasonable diligence, would not have 
known that the covered entity violated 
a provision, an amount not less than 
$100 or more than $50,000 for each 
violation; for a violation in which it is 
established that the violation was due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful 
neglect, an amount not less than $1000 
or more than $50,000 for each violation; 
for a violation in which it is established 
that the violation was due to willful 
neglect and was timely corrected, an 
amount not less than $10,000 or more 
than $50,000 for each violation; and for 
a violation in which it is established 
that the violation was due to willful 
neglect and was not timely corrected, an 
amount not less than $50,000 for each 
violation; except that a penalty for 
violations of the same requirement or 
prohibition under any of these 
categories may not exceed $1,500,000 in 
a calendar year. It also revised the 
affirmative defenses in § 160.410 for 
violations occurring on or after February 
18, 2009, to remove a covered entity’s 
lack of knowledge as an affirmative 
defense and to provide an affirmative 
defense when violations not due to 
willful neglect are corrected within 30 
days. Finally, the IFR added a 
requirement that a notice of proposed 
determination pursuant to § 160.420 
also reference the applicable category of 
violation. Readers are encouraged to 
refer to the IFR for a more detailed 
discussion of these topics as well as the 
Enforcement Rule’s statutory and 
regulatory background. See 74 FR 
56123, 56124, Oct. 30, 2009. 
The rules proposed below would 
revise many provisions of subparts C 
and D of part 160. However, the 
Department’s current interpretations of 
the regulatory provisions at subparts C 
and D continue unchanged, except to 
the extent they are inconsistent with the 
changes to those provisions, as 
indicated below. 
A. Subpart C—Compliance and 
Investigations, Section 160.304— 
Principles for Achieving Compliance 
Section 160.304 identifies cooperation 
and assistance as two overarching 
principles for achieving compliance. 
The principle of cooperation, in 
§ 160.304(a), states that ‘‘[t]he Secretary 
will, to the extent practicable, seek the 
cooperation of covered entities in

40876 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
obtaining compliance with the 
applicable administrative simplification 
provisions.’’ 
Section 13410(a) of the HITECH Act 
adds a new subsection (c) to section 
1176 of the Social Security Act: 
(c) NONCOMPLIANCE DUE TO WILLFUL 
NEGLECT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A violation of a 
provision of this part due to willful neglect 
is a violation for which the Secretary is 
required to impose a penalty under 
subsection (a)(1). 
(2) REQUIRED INVESTIGATION.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
formally investigate any complaint of a 
violation of a provision of this part if a 
preliminary investigation of the facts of the 
complaint indicate such a possible violation 
due to willful neglect. 
Section 13410(b)(1) makes the 
provisions of section 13410(a) effective 
February 18, 2011. 
Under section 1176(c), HHS is 
required to impose a civil money 
penalty for violations due to willful 
neglect. Accordingly, although the 
Secretary often will still seek to correct 
indications of noncompliance through 
voluntary corrective action, there may 
be circumstances (such as 
circumstances indicating willful 
neglect), where the Secretary may seek 
to proceed directly to formal 
enforcement. As a conforming 
amendment, HHS proposes to add the 
phrase, ‘‘and consistent with the 
provisions of this subpart,’’ to 
§ 160.304(a) to recognize the statutory 
revision. 
B. Subpart C—Compliance and 
Investigations, Section 160.306(c)— 
Complaints to the Secretary 
Section 160.306(c) of the Enforcement 
Rule currently provides the Secretary 
with discretion to investigate HIPAA 
complaints, through use of the word 
‘‘may.’’ The new willful neglect 
provisions, at section 1176(c)(2) of the 
Social Security Act, will require HHS to 
investigate ‘‘any complaint of a violation 
of a provision of this part if a 
preliminary investigation of the facts of 
the complaint indicates * * * a 
possible violation due to willful 
neglect.’’ 
HHS proposes to implement section 
1176(c)(2) by adding a new paragraph 
(1) at § 160.306(c) to provide that the 
Secretary will investigate any complaint 
filed under this section when a 
preliminary review of the facts indicates 
a possible violation due to willful 
neglect. As a practical matter, HHS 
currently conducts a preliminary review 
of every complaint received and 
proceeds with the investigation in every 
eligible case where its preliminary 
review of the facts indicate a possible 
violation of the HIPAA Rules. 
Nevertheless, we propose this addition 
to § 160.306 to make clear our intention 
to pursue an investigation where a 
preliminary review of the facts indicates 
a possible violation due to willful 
neglect. 
HHS proposes to conform the 
remainder of § 160.306(c) accordingly. 
The new § 160.306(c)(2) (presently, the 
initial sentence of § 160.306(c)) would 
be revised by replacing ‘‘complaints’’ 
with ‘‘any other complaint’’ to 
distinguish the Secretary’s discretion 
with respect to complaints for which 
HHS’s preliminary review of the facts 
does not indicate a possible violation 
due to willful neglect from the statutory 
requirement to investigate all 
complaints for which HHS’s 
preliminary review of the facts indicates 
a possible violation due to willful 
neglect, as set out in the new 
§ 160.306(c)(1). The current second 
sentence of § 160.306(c), which 
addresses the content of an 
investigation, would be renumbered as 
§ 160.306(c)(3) and amended by 
changing the first word of the sentence 
from ‘‘such’’ to ‘‘an,’’ to signal the 
provision’s application to any 
investigation, regardless of whether a 
preliminary review of the facts indicates 
a possible violation due to willful 
neglect. 
C. Subpart C—Compliance and 
Investigations, Section 160.308— 
Compliance Reviews 
Section 160.308 provides that the 
Secretary may conduct compliance 
reviews. Use of the word ‘‘may’’ in this 
section makes clear that this is a 
discretionary activity. While complaints 
and not compliance reviews are 
specifically mentioned in the statutory 
language of section 13410(a)(1)(B) of the 
Act regarding willful neglect, HHS 
proposes to also amend § 160.308 to 
provide that the Secretary will conduct 
a compliance review to determine 
whether a covered entity or business 
associate is complying with the 
applicable administrative simplification 
provision when a preliminary review of 
the facts indicates a possible violation 
due to willful neglect. This revision to 
§ 160.308 furthers Congress’ intent to 
strengthen enforcement with respect to 
potential violations due to willful 
neglect and ensures that investigations, 
whether or not initiated by complaint, 
are handled in a consistent manner. 
Also, the current language of § 160.308 
would be redesignated as paragraph (b), 
and the words ‘‘in any other 
circumstance’’ would be added to the 
end of this paragraph to indicate that 
the discretionary authority of this 
paragraph applies to cases where the 
preliminary review of the facts does not 
indicate a possible violation due to 
willful neglect. Note that if HHS 
initiates an investigation of a complaint 
because its preliminary review of the 
facts indicates a possible violation due 
to willful neglect, HHS would not also 
be required to initiate a compliance 
review under this section, since it 
would be duplicative to do so. 
D. Subpart C—Compliance and 
Investigations, Section 160.310— 
Responsibilities of Covered Entities 
Section 160.310 explains a covered 
entity’s responsibilities during 
complaint investigations and 
compliance reviews to make 
information available to the Secretary 
and to cooperate with the Secretary. 
Section 160.310(c)(3) provides that any 
protected health information obtained 
by the Secretary in connection with an 
investigation or compliance review will 
not be disclosed by the Secretary, except 
as necessary for determining and 
enforcing compliance with the HIPAA 
Rules or if otherwise required by law. 
We propose to also allow the Secretary 
to disclose protected health information 
if permitted under the Privacy Act at 5 
U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). Section 552a(b)(7) 
permits the disclosure of a record on an 
individual contained within a Privacy 
Act protected system of records to 
another agency or instrumentality of any 
governmental jurisdiction within or 
under the control of the United States 
for a civil or criminal law enforcement 
activity if the activity is authorized by 
law and if the agency has made a 
written request to the agency that 
maintains the record. This proposed 
change is necessary to permit the 
Secretary to cooperate with other law 
enforcement agencies, such as the State 
Attorneys General pursuing HIPAA 
actions on behalf of State residents 
pursuant to section 13410(e) of the Act, 
or the Federal Trade Commission, 
pursuing remedies under other 
consumer protection authorities. 
E. Subpart C—Compliance and 
Investigations, Section 160.312— 
Secretarial Action Regarding 
Complaints and Compliance Reviews 
Where noncompliance is indicated, 
§ 160.312 requires the Secretary to 
attempt to resolve situations by informal 
means. Section 1176(c)(2) of the Social 
Security Act, as added by section 
13410(a) of the HITECH Act, will 
require formal investigation of a 
complaint ‘‘if a preliminary 
investigation of the facts of the 
complaint indicate * * * a possible 
VerDate Mar<15>2010 15:51 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\14JYP2.SGM 14JYP2sro

violation due to willful neglect.’’ 
Further, section 1176(c)(1) of the Social 
Security Act, as added by section 
13410(a) of the HITECH Act, will 
require the Secretary to impose a civil 
money penalty where HHS makes a 
finding of a violation involving willful 
neglect. In addition to the proposed 
modification to § 160.306(c)(1), in light 
of the new provisions at section 1176(c), 
we propose to make clear that HHS is 
not required to attempt to resolve cases 
of noncompliance due to willful neglect 
by informal means. To do so, we 
propose to replace the word ‘‘will’’ in 
§ 160.312(a)(1) with ‘‘may.’’ While this 
change would permit HHS to proceed 
with a willful neglect determination as 
appropriate, it would also permit HHS 
to seek to resolve complaints and 
compliance reviews that did not 
indicate willful neglect by informal 
means (e.g., where the covered entity or 
business associate did not know and by 
exercising reasonable diligence would 
not have known of a violation, or where 
the violation is due to reasonable cause). 
It should be noted that this 
amendment would not change the 
substance of the response set forth in 
the April 18, 2005, preamble to the 
proposed Enforcement Rule, at 70 FR 
20224, 20245–6, regarding objections to 
the 60-day time limit for filing a request 
for a hearing. In that response, HHS 
indicated that it was not reasonable to 
assume that a notice of proposed 
determination would be served on a 
respondent with no warning because the 
covered entity would necessarily be 
made aware of, and have the 
opportunity to address, HHS’s 
compliance concerns throughout the 
investigative period preceding the 
notice of proposed determination. This 
proposed change to § 160.312 would 
allow the Secretary to proceed directly 
to a notice of proposed determination 
without first attempting to resolve the 
matter informally. This proposed 
revision does not change the fact that 
during the course of a complaint 
investigation or a compliance review, a 
covered entity or business associate 
would be made aware of, and have the 
opportunity to address, HHS’s 
compliance concerns. 
F. Subpart D—Imposition of Civil 
Money Penalties, Section 160.401— 
Definitions 
Section 160.401 provides definitions 
of the terms ‘‘reasonable cause,’’ 
‘‘reasonable diligence,’’ and ‘‘willful 
neglect.’’ As discussed in the interim 
final rule, at 74 FR 56123, 56126–7, 
given section 13410(d) of the Act’s use 
of these terms to describe the increasing 
levels of culpability for which 
increasing minimum levels of penalties 
may be imposed, HHS transferred these 
definitions from their prior placement at 
§ 160.410(a) to signal the definitions’ 
broader application to the entirety of 
subpart D of part 160. However, because 
section 13410(d) of the Act referred to 
these terms but did not amend these 
definitions, the interim final rule did 
not alter their content. HHS encourages 
readers, as it did in the interim final 
rule, to refer to prior preambles to the 
Enforcement Rule for detailed 
discussions of these terms at 70 FR 
20224, 20237–9 and 71 FR 8390, 8409– 
11. 
While the provisions of section 13410 
of the Act do not explicitly require 
modification of these definitions, HHS 
is concerned that the mens rea 
demarcation between the categories of 
culpability associated with the new tiers 
of civil money penalty amounts is not 
sufficiently clear based on the existing 
definitions. As a result, certain 
violations (i.e., those of which a covered 
entity or business associate has or 
should have knowledge, but does not 
have the conscious intent or reckless 
indifference associated with willful 
neglect) might not fit squarely within 
one of the established tiers. Therefore, 
HHS proposes to amend the definition 
of reasonable cause to clarify the scope 
of violations fitting within that 
definition. 
HHS does not propose to otherwise 
modify the definitions associated with 
the categories of culpability of the 
amended section 1176(a) of the Social 
Security Act. However, we wish to 
clarify how the Secretary intends to 
apply these terms within this newly 
established context, to assist covered 
entities and business associates in 
tailoring their compliance activities 
appropriately. Accordingly, the 
discussion below also addresses the 
terms associated with the other 
categories of culpability (i.e., 
knowledge, reasonable diligence, and 
willful neglect). 
1. Reasonable Cause 
Reasonable cause is currently defined, 
at § 160.401, to mean ‘‘circumstances 
that would make it unreasonable for the 
covered entity, despite the exercise of 
ordinary business care and prudence, to 
comply with the administrative 
simplification provision violated.’’ This 
definition is consistent with the 
Supreme Court’s ruling in United States 
v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 245 (1985), 
which focused on whether 
circumstances were beyond the 
regulated person’s control, thereby 
making compliance unreasonable. See 
70 FR 20224, 20238. Prior to the 
HITECH Act, section 1176 of the Social 
Security Act treated reasonable cause as 
a partial limitation on the Secretary’s 
authority to impose a civil money 
penalty. That is, by establishing that a 
violation was due to reasonable cause 
and not willful neglect and was either 
corrected within a 30-day period or 
such additional period as the Secretary 
determined to be appropriate, a covered 
entity or business associate would bar 
the Secretary’s imposition of a civil 
money penalty. 
As described above, section 13410(d) 
of the HITECH Act revised section 1176 
of the Social Security Act to establish 
four tiers of increasing penalty amounts 
to correspond to the levels of culpability 
associated with the violation. The first 
category of violation (and lowest 
penalty tier) covers situations where the 
covered entity or business associate did 
not know, and by exercising reasonable 
diligence would not have known, of a 
violation. The second category of 
violation (and next highest penalty tier) 
applies to violations due to reasonable 
cause and not to willful neglect. The 
third and fourth categories (and second- 
highest and highest penalty tiers) apply 
to circumstances where the violation 
was due to willful neglect that is 
corrected within a certain time period 
and willful neglect that is not so 
corrected, respectively. The importance 
of mens rea, or state of mind, in 
determining the degree of culpability is 
clear with respect to the first, third, and 
fourth categories, in that there is no 
mens rea with respect to the lowest 
category of violation, while the 
existence of mens rea is presumed with 
respect to the third and fourth categories 
of violation. 
However, the current definition of 
reasonable cause does not address mens 
rea with respect to the second category 
of violations. HHS therefore proposes to 
amend the definition of ‘‘reasonable 
cause’’ in § 160.401 to clarify the full 
scope of violations that will come 
within the reasonable cause category of 
violations, including those 
circumstances that would make it 
unreasonable for the covered entity or 
business associate, despite the exercise 
of ordinary business care and prudence, 
to comply with the administrative 
simplification provisions violated, as 
well as those circumstances in which a 
covered entity or business associate has 
knowledge of a violation but lacks the 
conscious intent or reckless indifference 
associated with the willful neglect 
category of violations. To that end, HHS 
proposes to replace the current 
definition of ‘‘reasonable cause’’ with the 
following:

40878 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
an act or omission in which a covered 
entity or business associate knew, or by 
exercising reasonable diligence would have 
known, that the act or omission violated an 
administrative simplification provision, but 
in which the covered entity or business 
associate did not act with willful neglect. 
As modified, the definition of 
‘‘reasonable cause’’ will continue to 
recognize those circumstances that 
would make it unreasonable for the 
covered entity or business associate, 
despite the exercise of ordinary business 
care and prudence, to comply with the 
administrative simplification provisions 
violated. Consider the following 
example: 
A covered entity received an individual’s 
request for access but did not respond within 
the time periods provided for in 
§ 164.524(b)(2). HHS’s investigation reveals 
that the covered entity had compliant access 
policies and procedures in place, but that it 
had received an unusually high volume of 
requests for access within the time period in 
question. While the covered entity had 
responded to the majority of access requests 
received in that time period in a timely 
manner, it had failed to respond in a timely 
manner to several requests for access. The 
covered entity did respond in a timely 
manner to all requests for access it received 
subsequent to the time period in which the 
violations occurred. 
In this example, the covered entity 
had knowledge of the violations but the 
investigation revealed circumstances 
that would make it unreasonable for the 
covered entity, despite the exercise of 
ordinary business care and prudence, to 
comply with the administrative 
simplification provisions violated. The 
investigation also revealed that the 
covered entity acted in a way that 
demonstrated a good faith attempt to 
comply with § 164.524(b)(2) by having 
compliant policies and procedures in 
place, responding to the majority of 
access requests in a timely manner, and 
otherwise responding to subsequent 
requests as required. In contrast, had the 
investigation revealed that the series of 
access requests occurred over a longer 
period of time, and that the covered 
entity did not attempt to address the 
backlog or communicate with the 
individuals, in writing, regarding the 
reasons for the delay or the date by 
which the covered entity would 
complete its action on the requests, the 
notice of proposed determination might 
alternatively categorize the violation as 
being due to willful neglect. 
The modified definition of reasonable 
cause will also encompass those 
circumstances in which a covered entity 
or business associate has knowledge of 
the violation but lacks the conscious 
intent or reckless indifference 
associated with willful neglect. 
Consider the following example: 
A covered entity presented an 
authorization form to a patient for signature 
to permit a disclosure for marketing purposes 
that did not contain the core elements 
required by § 164.508(c). HHS’s investigation 
reveals that the covered entity was aware of 
the requirement for an authorization for a use 
or disclosure of protected health information 
for marketing and had attempted to draft a 
compliant authorization but had not 
included in the authorization the core 
elements required under § 164.508. 
In this example, the covered entity 
failed to act with the ordinary care and 
business prudence of one seeking to 
comply with the Privacy Rule. 
Therefore, the violation cannot be 
considered to come within the category 
of violation that is associated with 
violations where the covered entity did 
not know (and by exercising reasonable 
diligence would not have known) of the 
violation. Yet, because the covered 
entity had attempted to draft a 
compliant authorization, it cannot be 
established that the omission was due to 
willful neglect involving either a 
conscious, intentional failure or reckless 
indifference to the obligation to comply 
with § 164.508. Unless otherwise 
resolved by informal means, HHS would 
have grounds to find that the violation 
was due to reasonable cause. 
2. Knowledge and Reasonable Diligence 
Prior rulemaking preambles 
discussing the Enforcement Rule 
explain the concept of knowledge, as it 
applies to the limitations (i.e., 
affirmative defenses) that section 
1176(b) of the Social Security Act places 
on the Secretary’s authority to impose a 
civil money penalty. As they explain, 
‘‘the knowledge involved must be 
knowledge that [a] violation has 
occurred, not just knowledge of the facts 
constituting the violation.’’ See 71 FR 
8390, 8410, Feb. 16, 2006. Moreover, a 
covered entity or business associate 
cannot assert an affirmative defense 
associated with its ‘‘lack of knowledge’’ 
if such lack of knowledge has resulted 
from its failure to inform itself about 
compliance obligations or to investigate 
received complaints or other 
information indicating likely 
noncompliance. See 70 FR 20224, 
20237–8, Apr. 18, 2005 and 71 FR 8390, 
8410–11, Feb. 16, 2006. 
Section 13410(d) of the Act 
establishes the category of violations 
where the covered entity or business 
associate did not know (and by 
exercising reasonable diligence would 
not have known) of a violation as 
warranting the lowest range of civil 
money penalty amounts. The HITECH 
Act incorporated the concepts of 
knowledge and reasonable diligence 
from HIPAA, and it did not revise their 
substance. HHS therefore expects to 
apply these existing concepts to the 
newly established penalty structure 
consistent with its prior interpretations. 
Consider the following examples: 
1. A covered health care provider with a 
direct treatment relationship with an 
individual patient failed to provide the 
patient a complete notice of privacy practices 
in compliance with § 164.520(c). HHS’s 
investigation reveals that the covered entity 
has a compliant notice of privacy practices, 
policies and procedures for provision of the 
notice, and appropriate training of its 
workforce regarding the notice and its 
distribution. The violation resulted from a 
printing error that failed to print two pages 
of the notice of privacy practices. The 
printing error affected a small number of the 
covered entity’s supply of notices and was an 
isolated failure to provide an individual with 
the covered entity’s notice of privacy 
practices. 
2. A business associate failed to terminate 
a former employee’s access privileges to 
electronic protected health information in 
compliance with § 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C). HHS’s 
investigation reveals that the business 
associate’s policies and procedures require 
the termination of such access within a 
reasonable time period. The HHS 
investigation reveals that the business 
associate attempted to terminate the former 
employee’s access in accordance with its 
policy, but that it instead terminated the 
access of a current employee who had the 
same name as the former employee. 
In both examples, HHS’s investigations 
reveal that the covered entity or 
business associate has compliant 
policies and procedures in place, as 
well as some action by each covered 
entity or business associate indicating 
its intent to implement the respective 
Privacy Rule requirements. The 
investigations also reveal 
noncompliance that the exercise of 
reasonable diligence would not have 
avoided. 
HHS also notes that, in some 
circumstances, we expect that the 
knowledge of an employee or agent of 
a covered entity or business associate 
may determine whether a violation 
implicates the ‘‘did not know’’ or 
‘‘reasonable cause’’ categories of 
violation. That is, absent an exception 
under the Federal common law of 
agency, the knowledge of an employee 
or agent will generally be imputed to its 
principal (i.e., the covered entity or 
business associate). See 70 FR 20224, 
20237 and 71 FR 8390, 8402–3 
(discussing imputation of knowledge 
under the Federal common law of 
agency and violations attributed to a 
covered entity, respectively). Consider 
the following example: 
VerDate Mar<15>2010 15:51 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\14JYP2.SGM 14JYP2sro

40879 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
A hospital employee accessed the paper 
medical record of his ex-spouse while he was 
on duty to discover her current address for 
a personal reason, knowing that such access 
is not permitted by the Privacy Rule and 
contrary to the policies and procedures of the 
hospital. HHS’s investigation reveals that the 
covered entity had appropriate and 
reasonable safeguards regarding employee 
access to medical records, and that it had 
delivered appropriate training to the 
employee. 
In this example, the ‘‘did not know’’ 
category of violation is implicated with 
respect to the covered entity because the 
mens rea element of knowledge cannot 
be established. That is, while the 
employee’s act is attributed to the 
covered entity, the employee’s 
knowledge of the violation cannot be 
imputed to the covered entity because 
the employee was acting adversely to 
the covered entity. The Federal common 
law of agency does not permit the 
imputation of knowledge to the 
principal where the agent consciously 
acts in a manner that is adverse to the 
principal. 
3. Willful Neglect 
Willful neglect is defined, at 
§ 160.401, to mean the ‘‘conscious, 
intentional failure or reckless 
indifference to the obligation to comply 
with the administrative simplification 
provision violated.’’ The term not only 
presumes actual or constructive 
knowledge on the part of the covered 
entity that a violation is virtually certain 
to occur but also encompasses a 
conscious intent or degree of 
recklessness with regard to its 
compliance obligations. 
While the HITECH Act references 
willful neglect in several provisions, it 
does not revise the term’s definition. 
HHS therefore expects to apply the 
current definition of willful neglect to 
all newly established contexts in the 
same manner as previously discussed. 
Consider the following examples: 
1. A covered entity disposed of several 
hard drives containing electronic protected 
health information in an unsecured 
dumpster, in violation of § 164.530(c) and 
§ 164.310(d)(2)(i). HHS’s investigation reveals 
that the covered entity had failed to 
implement any policies and procedures to 
reasonably and appropriately safeguard 
protected health information during the 
disposal process. 
2. A covered entity failed to respond to an 
individual’s request that it restrict its uses 
and disclosures of protected health 
information about the individual. HHS’s 
investigation reveals that the covered entity 
does not have any policies and procedures in 
place for consideration of the restriction 
requests it receives and refuses to accept any 
requests for restrictions from individual 
patients who inquire. 
3. A covered entity’s employee lost an 
unencrypted laptop that contained unsecured 
protected health information. HHS’s 
investigation reveals the covered entity 
feared its reputation would be harmed if 
information about the incident became 
public and, therefore, decided not to provide 
notification as required by § 164.400 et seq. 
The facts in these examples demonstrate 
that the covered entities had actual or 
constructive knowledge of their various 
violations. In addition, the covered 
entities’ failures to develop or 
implement compliant policies and 
procedures or to respond to incidents as 
required by § 164.400 et seq. 
demonstrate either conscious intent or 
reckless disregard with respect to their 
compliance obligations. In the second 
example, the covered entity’s refusal to 
accept any requests for restrictions from 
individual patients who inquire would 
be grounds for a separate finding of a 
violation due to willful neglect. 
4. Correction of Willful Neglect 
Violations 
We also note that while a covered 
entity’s or business associate’s 
correction of a willful neglect violation 
will not bar the imposition of a civil 
money penalty, such correction may 
foreclose the Secretary’s authority to 
impose a penalty from the highest 
penalty tier prescribed by section 
1176(a)(1) of the Social Security Act. 
While not all violations can be 
corrected, in the sense of being fully 
undone or remediated, HHS has 
previously set forth a broad 
interpretation of ‘‘corrected,’’ in light of 
the statute’s association of the term with 
‘‘failure to comply.’’ See 71 FR 8390, 
8411 (recognizing that the term 
‘‘corrected’’ could include correction of 
a covered entity’s noncompliant 
procedure by making the procedure 
compliant). For example, in the event a 
covered entity’s or business associate’s 
inadequate safeguards policies and 
procedures result in an impermissible 
disclosure, the disclosure violation itself 
could not be fully undone or corrected. 
The safeguards violation, however, 
could be ‘‘corrected’’ in the sense that 
the noncompliant policies and 
procedures could be brought into 
compliance. In any event, corrective 
action will always be required of a 
covered entity or business associate. 
G. Subpart D—Imposition of Civil 
Money Penalties, Section 160.402— 
Basis for a Civil Money Penalty 
Section 160.402(a) provides the 
general rule that the Secretary will 
impose a civil money penalty upon a 
covered entity if the Secretary 
determines that the covered entity 
violated an administrative 
simplification provision. Paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section explain the basis 
for a civil money penalty against a 
covered entity where more than one 
covered entity is responsible for a 
violation, where an affiliated covered 
entity is responsible for a violation, and 
where an agent of a covered entity is 
responsible for a violation. As explained 
above, this proposed rule would add 
references to ‘‘business associate’’ where 
appropriate in this section to effectuate 
the HITECH Act’s imposition of liability 
on business associates for violations of 
the HITECH Act and certain Privacy and 
Security Rule provisions. 
Further, in paragraph (c), which 
provides the basis for the imposition of 
a civil money penalty against a covered 
entity for the acts of its agent, in 
accordance with the Federal common 
law of agency, we propose to add a 
parallel provision providing for civil 
money penalty liability against a 
business associate for the acts of its 
agent. Thus, we propose to add a new 
paragraph (2) to § 160.402(c) to provide 
that a business associate is liable, in 
accordance with the Federal common 
law of agency, for a civil money penalty 
for a violation based on the act or 
omission of any agent of the business 
associate, including a workforce 
member or subcontractor, acting within 
the scope of the agency. 
The existing language of § 160.402(c) 
regarding the liability of covered entities 
for the acts of their agents would be 
redesignated as paragraph (1), with one 
substantive change. This section 
currently provides an exception for 
covered entity liability for the acts of its 
agent in cases where the agent is a 
business associate, the relevant contract 
requirements have been met, the 
covered entity did not know of a pattern 
or practice of the business associate in 
violation of the contract, and the 
covered entity did not fail to act as 
required by the Privacy or Security Rule 
with respect to such violations. We 
propose to remove this exception to 
principal liability for the covered entity 
so that the covered entity remains liable 
for the acts of its business associate 
agents, regardless of whether the 
covered entity has a compliant business 
associate agreement in place. This 
change is necessary to ensure, where the 
covered entity has contracted out a 
particular obligation under the HIPAA 
Rules, such as the requirement to 
provide individuals with a notice of 
privacy practices, that the covered 
entity remains liable for the failure of its 
business associate to perform that 
obligation on the covered entity’s 
behalf.

40880 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
We do not believe this proposed 
change would place any undue burden 
on covered entities, since covered 
entities are customarily liable for the 
acts of their agents under agency 
common law. We note that this 
proposed regulatory change does not 
create liability for covered entities with 
respect to business associates that are 
not agents, e.g., independent 
contractors. The determination of 
whether a business associate is an agent 
of a covered entity, or whether a 
subcontractor is an agent of a business 
associate, will be based on the facts of 
the relationship, such as the level of 
control over the business associate’s or 
subcontractor’s conduct. 
H. Subpart D—Imposition of Civil 
Money Penalties, Section 160.408— 
Factors Considered in Determining the 
Amount of a Civil Money Penalty 
1. Determination of Penalty Amounts 
Prior to the HITECH Act 
Section 160.408 implements section 
1176(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, 
which requires the Secretary, when 
imposing a civil money penalty, to 
apply the provisions of section 1128A of 
the Social Security Act ‘‘in the same 
manner as such provisions apply to the 
imposition of a civil money penalty 
under section 1128A.’’ As currently 
written, Section 1128A requires the 
Secretary to take into account— 
(1) The nature of the claims and the 
circumstances under which they were 
presented, 
(2) The degree of culpability, history of 
prior offenses and financial condition of the 
person presenting the claims, and 
(3) Such other matters as justice may 
require. 
Like other regulations that implement 
section 1128A, HHS tailored these 
factors by breaking them down into 
their component elements and 
providing a more specific list of 
circumstances, within each component, 
that apply to the context of HIPAA Rule 
violations. Because the Enforcement 
Rule applies to a number of rules, which 
apply to an enormous number of entities 
and circumstances, HHS left to the 
Secretary’s discretion the decisions of 
whether and how (i.e., as either 
aggravating or mitigating) to consider 
the following factors in determining the 
amount of a civil money penalty: 
(a) The nature of the violation, in light of 
the purpose of the rule violated. 
(b) The circumstances, including the 
consequences, of the violation, including but 
not limited to * * * [specific circumstances] 
(c) The degree of culpability of the covered 
entity, including but not limited to * * * 
[specific circumstances] 
(d) Any history of prior compliance with 
the administrative simplification provisions, 
including violations, by the covered entity, 
including but not limited to * * * [specific 
circumstances] 
(e) The financial condition of the covered 
entity, including but not limited to * * * 
[specific circumstances] 
(f) Such other matters as justice may 
require. 
See 70 FR 20224, 20235–6 and 71 FR 
8390, 8407–9 for a discussion of HHS’s 
interpretation of the factors currently 
enumerated in § 160.408. 
2. Determination of Penalty Amounts 
After the HITECH Act 
As discussed in more detail in the 
IFR, section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act 
modified section 1176(a)(1) of the Social 
Security Act in several ways, including 
the establishment of tiers of penalty 
amounts that are associated with 
increasing levels of culpability. It also 
added a provision to section 1176(a)(1) 
of the Social Security Act directing HHS 
to ‘‘base such determination [of the 
appropriate penalty amount] on the 
nature and extent of the violation and 
the nature and extent of the harm 
resulting from such violation.’’ The 
HITECH Act did not modify section 
1176(a)(2) (requiring application of 
section 1128A). In addition, many of the 
factors currently identified by § 160.408 
already pertain to the nature of the 
violation and the resulting harm. 
Section 160.408(a), for example, 
identifies the nature of the violation for 
consideration; paragraph (b) addresses 
the circumstances, including the 
consequences, of the violation (e.g., 
physical harm, financial harm and 
whether the violation hindered or 
facilitated an individual’s ability to 
obtain health care); and paragraph (f) 
addresses such other matters as justice 
may require. Thus, HHS did not modify 
§ 160.408 in the IFR. 
Upon further consideration of the 
statutory mandates and the significantly 
broader range of penalty amounts 
available, HHS believes it is appropriate 
to amend the structure of § 160.408, to 
make explicit the new statutory 
requirement that the Secretary consider 
the nature and extent of the violation 
and the nature and extent of the harm 
resulting from the violation, in addition 
to those factors enumerated in section 
1128A. Thus, HHS proposes to revise 
§ 160.408(a) and (b), as discussed below, 
to require the Secretary’s consideration 
of the nature and extent of the violation, 
as well as the nature and extent of the 
harm resulting from violation, in 
addition to those factors referenced by 
section 1128A. We would exclude, 
however, the factor presently identified 
as § 160.408(c) (the degree of culpability 
of covered entity), which originated in 
section 1128A. Congress’ revision of 
section 1176(a)(1) of the Social Security 
Act to establish increasing tiers of 
penalty amounts that reflect increasing 
degrees of culpability renders 
consideration of the degree of 
culpability as an aggravating or 
mitigating factor redundant. In contrast, 
HHS is not proposing to amend the 
Secretary’s discretion with respect to 
the non-exhaustive list of specific 
circumstances that may be considered. 
In addition, HHS proposes to 
reorganize the remaining, specific 
circumstances under § 160.408(a) and 
(b) to better reflect the categories to 
which they are now attributed, to add 
another circumstance for consideration 
under each, as described below, to 
explicitly provide that the Secretary’s 
consideration of all specific 
circumstances is optional, and to 
modify the phrase ‘‘prior violations’’ in 
subsections (c)(1) and (2) to read 
‘‘indications of noncompliance.’’ 
a. The Nature and Extent of the 
Violation 
HHS proposes to revise subsection (a) 
to identify ‘‘[t]he nature and extent of 
the violation,’’ as the first factor the 
Secretary must consider in determining 
a civil money penalty amount. While 
the ‘‘the nature of the violation’’ was 
previously identified for consideration, 
as it is grounded in section 1128A, the 
current list of factors in § 160.408 does 
not specifically reference ‘‘the extent of 
the violation,’’ which section 1176(a) 
now requires. We also propose to 
transfer ‘‘the time period during which 
the violation(s) occurred,’’ to this factor 
and to add, ‘‘the number of individuals 
affected,’’ since both circumstances 
might be indicative measures of ‘‘the 
nature and extent of the violation.’’ Our 
compliance and enforcement experience 
to date further supports the addition of 
the latter, particularly with respect to 
potential violations that negatively 
affect numerous individuals (e.g., where 
disclosure of protected health 
information in multiple explanation of 
benefits statements that were mailed to 
the wrong individuals resulted from one 
inadequate safeguard but affected a large 
number of beneficiaries). We recognize 
these specific circumstances might also 
be considered under § 160.406, with 
respect to counting violations. In this 
regard, we direct readers’ attention to 71 
FR 8390, 8409 (responding to a 
comment expressing concern that the 
overlap of certain variables proposed in 
§ 160.406 with factors proposed in 
§ 160.408 might result in compound 
liability by asserting that since

consideration of such circumstances 
may be relevant to each separable 
element of the penalty calculation, their 
consideration will be different in 
nature). 
b. The Nature and Extent of the Harm 
Resulting From the Violations 
HHS proposes to revise subsection (a) 
to identify ‘‘[t]he nature and extent of 
the harm resulting from the violation’’ as 
the second factor the Secretary must 
consider. This minor amendment 
merely conforms the factor’s language to 
the amended statutory language and 
continues to include the optional 
consideration of several specific 
circumstances which might be 
indicative of harm. In addition to these 
specific circumstances, HHS proposes to 
add reputational harm to make clear 
that reputational harm is as cognizable 
a form of harm as physical or financial 
harm. 
c. The History of Prior Compliance With 
the Administrative Simplification 
Provisions 
HHS proposes to modify the phrase 
‘‘prior violations’’ in § 160.408(c)(1) and 
(2) to read ‘‘indications of 
noncompliance.’’ As defined in 
§ 160.302, ‘‘violation’’ or ‘‘violate’’ 
means, ‘‘as the context may require, 
failure to comply with an administrative 
simplification provision.’’ Use of the 
term is generally reserved, however, to 
circumstances in which the Department 
has made a formal finding of a violation 
through a notice of proposed 
determination. As explained in 71 FR 
8390, 8408, a covered entity’s general 
history of HIPAA compliance is relevant 
in determining the amount of a civil 
money penalty within the penalty range. 
When we reviewed this language of 
§ 160.408(c)(1) and (2) for the purposes 
of this rulemaking, we noticed that the 
regulatory text uses the term ‘‘violation’’ 
which is generally reserved for use in a 
notice of proposed determination. We 
are proposing to change this 
terminology to ‘‘indications of 
noncompliance’’ to make the regulatory 
language consistent with HHS’ policy of 
considering a covered entity’s general 
history of HIPAA compliance. 
I. Section 160.410—Affirmative 
Defenses 
Section 160.410 currently implements 
the limitations placed on the Secretary’s 
authority to impose a civil money 
penalty under section 1176(b) of the 
Act. As amended by the IFR, § 160.410 
is organized to implement section 
13410(d) of the HITECH Act in a way 
that distinguishes the affirmative 
defenses available to covered entities 
and business associates prior to, on, or 
after February 18, 2009, the day after 
section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act 
became effective. See 74 FR 56123, Oct. 
30, 2009, for a detailed discussion of the 
IFR’s recent amendments. 
Section 13410(a)(1) revises section 
1176(b) to replace the phrase, ‘‘if the act 
constitutes an offense punishable under 
section 1177’’ with ‘‘a penalty has been 
imposed under section 1177 with 
respect to such act.’’ This statutory 
change is effective February 18, 2011. 
HHS proposes to amend § 160.410 to 
implement the revision of section 
1176(b)(1) of the Social Security Act by 
providing in a new paragraph (a)(1) that 
the affirmative defense of criminally 
‘‘punishable’’ is applicable to penalties 
imposed prior to February 18, 2011. A 
new paragraph (a)(2) in that section 
would make clear that, on or after 
February 18, 2011, the Secretary’s 
authority to impose a civil money 
penalty will only be barred to the extent 
a covered entity or business associate 
can demonstrate that a penalty has been 
imposed under 42 U.S.C. 1320d–6 with 
respect to such act. As a conforming 
change, current paragraphs (a)(2) and 
(a)(3) are renumbered as paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, and 
current paragraph (b) is renumbered as 
paragraph (c). 
As an additional conforming change, 
HHS also proposes to amend 
§ 160.410(a)(3)(i) (which has been 
redesignated as § 160.410(b)(2)(i)) to 
replace the term ‘‘reasonable cause’’ with 
the unrevised text of its current 
definition. This will ensure that the 
current definition is applied to 
violations occurring prior to February 
18, 2009, thereby avoiding any potential 
issues regarding a retroactive 
application of the revised term. 
J. Section 160.412—Waiver 
We propose conforming changes to 
this section, to align the cross-references 
to § 160.410 with the proposed revisions 
to that section discussed above. 
K. Subpart D—Imposition of Civil 
Money Penalties, Section 160.418— 
Penalty Not Exclusive 
We propose to revise this section to 
incorporate a reference to the provision 
of the Patient Safety and Quality 
Improvement Act of 2005 at 42 U.S.C. 
299b–22 that provides that penalties are 
not to be imposed under both that act 
and the Privacy Rule for the same 
violation. 
V. Section-by-Section Description of the 
Proposed Amendments to Subpart A of 
Part 164 and the Security Rule in 
Subpart C of Part 164 
The HITECH Act made several 
amendments that directly impact 
current provisions of the HIPAA 
Security Rule. We discuss the proposed 
changes to the Security Rule as a result 
of the HITECH Act in our section-by- 
section description below. We also 
discuss various technical and 
conforming proposed changes to the 
Security Rule, as well as proposed 
changes to provisions in subpart A of 
part 164, which applies to both the 
Security and Privacy Rules. 
A. Technical Changes to Subpart A— 
General Provisions 
1. Section 164.102—Statutory Basis 
This section sets out the statutory 
basis of part 164. We propose a 
technical change to include a reference 
to the provisions of sections 13400 
through 13424 of the HITECH Act upon 
which the regulatory changes proposed 
below are based. 
2. Section 164.104—Applicability 
This section sets out to whom part 
164 applies. We propose to replace the 
existing paragraph (b) with an 
applicability statement for business 
associates, consistent with the 
provisions of the HITECH Act that are 
discussed more fully below. Proposed 
paragraph (b) would make clear that, 
where provided, the standards, 
requirements, and implementation 
specifications of the HIPAA Privacy, 
Security, and Breach Notification Rules 
apply to business associates. We 
propose to remove as unnecessary the 
existing language in § 164.104(b) 
regarding the obligation of a health care 
clearinghouse to comply with § 164.105 
relating to organizational requirements 
of covered entities. 
3. Section 164.105—Organizational 
Requirements 
a. Section 164.105 
Section 164.105 outlines the 
organizational requirements and 
implementation specifications for health 
care components of covered entities and 
for affiliated covered entities. As 
§ 164.105 now also applies to subpart D 
of part 164 regarding breach notification 
for unsecured protected health 
information, we propose to remove 
several references to subparts C and E 
throughout this section to make clear 
that the provisions of this section also 
apply to the new subpart D of this part. 
In addition, we propose the following 
modifications to this section.

40882 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
b. Section 164.105(a)(2)(ii)(C)–(E) 
We propose to modify this section to 
remove as unnecessary paragraphs (C) 
and (D), which pertain to the obligation 
of a covered entity to ensure that any 
component that performs business 
associate-like activities and is included 
in the health care component complies 
with the requirements of the Privacy 
and Security Rules, and to re-designate 
paragraph (E) as (C). A covered entity’s 
obligation to ensure that a health care 
component complies with the Privacy 
and Security Rules is already set out at 
§ 164.105(a)(2)(ii). In addition, in light 
of a business associate’s new direct 
liability for compliance with certain of 
the Security and Privacy Rule 
provisions, we request comment on 
whether we should require, rather than 
permit as is currently the case under 
§ 164.105(a)(2)(iii)(C), a covered entity 
that is a hybrid entity to include a 
component that performs business 
associate-like activities within its health 
care component so that such 
components are directly subject to the 
Rules. 
c. Section 164.105(a)(2)(iii)(C) 
We propose to modify this section to 
re-designate § 164.105(a)(2)(iii)(C) as 
(D), and to include a new paragraph (C), 
which makes clear that, with respect to 
a hybrid entity, the covered entity itself, 
and not merely the health care 
component, remains responsible for 
complying with §§ 164.314 and 164.504 
regarding business associate 
arrangements and other organizational 
requirements. This proposed 
modification is intended to recognize 
that hybrid entities may need to execute 
legal contracts and conduct other 
organizational matters at the level of the 
legal entity rather than at the level of the 
health care component. 
d. Section 164.105(b)(1) 
We propose to fix a minor 
typographical error in this paragraph by 
redesignating the second paragraph (1) 
as paragraph (2). 
e. Section 164.105(b)(2)(ii) 
We propose to simplify this paragraph 
by collapsing subparagraphs (A), (B), 
and (C) regarding the obligations of an 
affiliated entity to comply with the 
Privacy and Security Rules into one 
provision, and to expand the reference 
to compliance with the ‘‘part’’ so that the 
breach notification obligations in 
subpart D are also included. 
4. Section 164.106—Relationship to 
Other Parts 
We propose to add a reference to 
business associates, consistent with 
their inclusion elsewhere throughout 
the other HIPAA Rules. 
B. Modifications to the HIPAA Security 
Rule in Subpart C 
1. References to Business Associates 
The Security Rule, as it presently 
stands, does not directly apply to 
business associates of covered entities. 
However, section 13401 of the HITECH 
Act, which became effective on 
February 18, 2010, provides that the 
Security Rule’s administrative, physical, 
and technical safeguards requirements 
in §§ 164.308, 164.310, and 164.312, as 
well as its policies and procedures and 
documentation requirements in 
§ 164.316, shall apply to business 
associates in the same manner as these 
requirements apply to covered entities, 
and that business associates shall be 
civilly and criminally liable for 
penalties for violations of these 
provisions. 
Accordingly, to implement section 
13401 of the HITECH Act, we propose 
to insert references to ‘‘business 
associate’’ in subpart C, as appropriate, 
following references to ‘‘covered entity’’ 
to make clear that these provisions of 
the Security Rule also apply to business 
associates. In particular, we propose to 
modify the following sections by adding 
references to business associates: 
§§ 164.302 (applicability), 164.304 
(definitions of ‘‘administrative 
safeguard’’ and ‘‘physical safeguard’’), 
164.308, 164.310, 164.312, and 164.316. 
In addition, we propose the changes 
below to the Security Rule. 
2. Section 164.306—Security Standards: 
General Rules 
Section 13401 of the HITECH Act 
pertaining to requirements on business 
associates does not specifically make 
reference to § 164.306 of the Security 
Rule. However, § 164.306 sets out the 
general rules that apply to all of the 
security standards and implementation 
specifications that follow. Thus, for 
example, § 164.306(b)(2) sets out the 
particular factors that covered entities 
must take into account in deciding 
which security measures to use, and 
§ 164.306(d) sets out the general rule 
that required implementation 
specifications must be implemented and 
the process and basis for implementing 
addressable implementation 
specifications. Accordingly, §§ 164.308, 
164.310, and 164.312 provide that the 
administrative, physical, and technical 
safeguards of the Security Rule must be 
implemented ‘‘in accordance with 
§ 164.306.’’ We do not believe that 
Congress intended to apply enumerated 
Security Rule sections to business 
associates in a different manner than to 
covered entities, as evidenced by the 
statutory language that these sections 
should be applied to business associates 
‘‘in the same manner that such sections 
apply to the covered entity.’’ For these 
reasons, we also propose to revise 
§ 164.306 to insert the word ‘‘business 
associate,’’ as appropriate, so that the 
general rules found at § 164.306 apply to 
business associates in the same manner 
as covered entities. 
In addition, we propose technical 
revisions to § 164.306(e) to more clearly 
indicate that to maintain security 
measures that continue to meet the 
requirements of §§ 164.308, 164.310, 
and 164.312, covered entities and 
business associates must review and 
modify such security measures and 
update documentation accordingly 
under § 164.316(b)(2)(iii). 
3. Section 164.308—Administrative 
Safeguards 
First, as noted above, we propose to 
modify § 164.308 to include throughout 
appropriate references to business 
associates. Second, we propose a 
technical change to § 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C) 
regarding security termination 
procedures for workforce members, to 
add the words ‘‘or other arrangement 
with’’ after ‘‘employment of’’ in 
recognition of the fact that not all 
workforce members are employees (e.g., 
some may be volunteers) of a covered 
entity or business associate. Third, we 
propose to remove the reference to 
§ 164.306 in paragraph (b)(1) as 
unnecessary. Fourth, as discussed 
below, we propose a number of 
modifications to the provisions in this 
section regarding business associate 
contracts and other arrangements to 
conform to and address modifications 
proposed in the definition of ‘‘business 
associate,’’ including the proposed 
inclusion of subcontractors within the 
scope of ‘‘business associate.’’ 
Section 164.308(b) provides that a 
covered entity may permit a business 
associate to create, receive, maintain, or 
transmit electronic protected health 
information only if the covered entity 
has a contract or other arrangement in 
place to ensure the business associate 
will appropriately safeguard the 
protected health information. Section 
164.308(b)(2) contains several 
exceptions to this general rule for 
certain situations that do not give rise to 
a business associate relationship, such 
as where a covered entity discloses 
electronic protected health information 
to a health care provider concerning the 
treatment of an individual. We propose 
to remove these exceptions from 
§ 164.308(b)(2), since as discussed 
VerDate Mar<15>2010 15:51 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\14JYP2.SGM 14JYP2sro

40883 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
above, we propose to include these as 
exceptions to the definition of ‘‘business 
associate.’’ 
In addition, we propose to modify 
§ 164.308(b)(1) and (2) to clarify the new 
proposed requirements on business 
associates with regard to subcontractors. 
As described above with respect to the 
definition of ‘‘business associate’’ in 
§ 160.103, we propose to include in the 
definition subcontractors that create, 
receive, maintain, or transmit protected 
health information on behalf of a 
business associate. However, we do not 
intend this proposed modification to 
mean that a covered entity is required 
to have a contract with the 
subcontractor. Rather, such obligation is 
to remain with the business associate 
who contracts with the subcontractor. 
Accordingly, in § 164.308(b)(1), we 
propose to clarify that covered entities 
are not required to obtain satisfactory 
assurances in the form of a contract or 
other arrangement with a business 
associate that is a subcontractor. In 
§ 164.308(b)(2), we then propose to 
make clear that it is the business 
associate that must obtain the required 
satisfactory assurances from the 
subcontractor to protect the security of 
electronic protected health information. 
We propose to remove the provision 
at § 164.308(b)(3), which provides that a 
covered entity that violates the 
satisfactory assurances it provided as a 
business associate of another covered 
entity will be in noncompliance with 
the Security Rule’s business associate 
provisions, as a covered entity’s actions 
as a business associate of another 
covered entity are now directly 
regulated by the Security Rule’s 
provisions that apply to business 
associates. 
Finally, in § 164.308(b)(4) 
(renumbered as § 164.308(b)(3)), which 
requires documentation of the required 
satisfactory assurances through a 
written contract or other arrangement, 
we propose to add a reference to the 
new paragraph at § 164.308(b)(2) 
regarding business associates and 
subcontractors. 
4. Section 164.314—Organizational 
Requirements 
Section 13401 of the HITECH Act 
does not include § 164.314 among the 
provisions for which business associates 
are directly liable. However, section 
13401 does state that § 164.308 applies 
to business associates ‘‘in the same 
manner’’ that the provision applies to 
covered entities. Section 164.308(b) 
requires a covered entity’s business 
associate agreements to conform to the 
requirements of § 164.314. Accordingly, 
in order for § 164.308(b) to apply to 
business associates in the same manner 
as it applies to covered entities, we have 
revised § 164.314 to reflect that it is also 
applicable to agreements between 
business associates and subcontractors 
that create, receive, maintain, or 
transmit electronic protected health 
information. 
We also propose a number of 
modifications to the business associate 
contract requirements in § 164.314 to 
streamline the provisions. First, we 
propose to remove § 164.314(a)(1)(ii) 
regarding the steps a covered entity 
must take if it knows of a material 
breach or violation by the business 
associate of the contract. A parallel 
provision exists in the Privacy Rule’s 
business associate contract provisions at 
§ 164.504 and, since a business associate 
for purposes of the Security Rule is also 
always a business associate for purposes 
of the Privacy Rule, the inclusion of a 
duplicate provision in the Security Rule 
is unnecessary. For the same reason, we 
also propose to remove the contract 
provision at § 164.314(a)(2)(i)(D) 
authorizing the termination of the 
contract by the covered entity if it is 
determined the business associate has 
violated a material term of the contract. 
A parallel provision exists in the 
Privacy Rule at § 164.504(e)(2)(iii). Also, 
because the Privacy Rule has a parallel 
provision, we remove the specific 
requirements under § 164.314(a)(2)(ii) 
for other arrangements, such as a 
memorandum of understanding when 
both a covered entity and business 
associate are governmental entities, and 
instead simply refer to the requirements 
of § 164.504(e)(3). 
Second, we propose the following 
modifications to the remaining contract 
provision requirements: (1) In 
§ 164.314(a)(2)(i)(A), we streamline the 
provision to simply indicate a business 
associate’s obligation to comply with 
the Security Rule; (2) in 
§ 164.314(a)(2)(i)(B), we revise the 
language with respect to ensuring 
subcontractors implement reasonable 
and appropriate safeguards to refer to 
the proposed requirement at 
§ 164.308(b)(4) that would require a 
business associate to enter into a 
contract or other arrangement with a 
subcontractor to protect the security of 
electronic protected health information; 
and (3) in § 164.314(a)(2)(i)(C), with 
respect to the reporting of security 
incidents by business associates to 
covered entities, we make clear that the 
business associate contract must 
provide that the business associate will 
report to the covered entity breaches of 
unsecured protected health information 
as required by § 164.410 of the breach 
notification rules. 
Third, we add a provision at 
§ 164.314(a)(2)(iii) that provides that the 
requirements of this section for 
contracts or other arrangements between 
a covered entity and business associate 
would apply in the same manner to 
contracts or other arrangements between 
business associates and subcontractors 
required by the proposed requirements 
of § 164.308(b)(4). For example, to 
comply with proposed 
§ 164.314(a)(2)(i)(C), a business 
associate contract between a business 
associate and a business associate 
subcontractor must provide that the 
subcontractor report any security 
incident of which it becomes aware, 
including breaches of unsecured 
protected health information as required 
by § 164.410, to the business associate. 
Thus, if a breach of unsecured protected 
health information occurs at or by a 
subcontractor, the subcontractor must 
notify the business associate of the 
breach, which then must notify the 
covered entity of the breach. The 
covered entity then notifies the affected 
individuals, the Secretary, and, if 
applicable, the media, of the breach, 
unless it has delegated such 
responsibilities to a business associate. 
Finally, we propose to remove the 
reference to subcontractors in 
§ 164.314(b)(2)(iii) regarding 
amendment of group health plan 
documents as a condition of disclosure 
of protected health information to a plan 
sponsor, to avoid confusion with the use 
of the term subcontractor when referring 
to subcontractors that are business 
associates. This modification does not 
constitute a substantive change to 
§ 164.314(b). 
VI. Section-by-Section Description of 
the Proposed Amendments to the 
Privacy Rule 
The HITECH Act made a number of 
amendments that affect current 
provisions of the Privacy Rule. In the 
section-by-section description of the 
proposed regulatory changes below, we 
discuss the HITECH Act requirements 
and the regulatory provisions affected 
by them, as well as certain other 
substantive proposed changes to the 
Privacy Rule intended to improve the 
workability and effectiveness of the 
Rule and to conform the Privacy Rule to 
PSQIA. At the end of this discussion, 
we also briefly list a number of 
proposed technical corrections and 
conforming changes to the Privacy Rule 
that are not otherwise addressed 
elsewhere. 
A. Section 164.500—Applicability 
We propose to revise § 164.500 to 
include new § 164.500(c) and to

40884 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
redesignate the current § 164.500(c) as 
(d). In accordance with section 13404 of 
the HITECH Act, which applies certain 
of the Privacy Rule requirements to 
business associates, as discussed more 
fully below, § 164.500(c) would now 
clarify that, where provided, the 
standards, requirements, and 
implementation specifications of the 
Privacy Rule apply to business 
associates. 
B. Section 164.501—Definitions 
1. Definition of ‘‘Health Care 
Operations’’ 
PSQIA, 42 U.S.C. 299b–21 et seq., 
provides, among other things, that PSOs 
are to be treated as business associates 
of covered health care providers. 
Further, PSQIA provides that the patient 
safety activities of PSOs in relation to 
HIPAA covered health care providers 
are deemed to be health care operations 
under the Privacy Rule. See 42 U.S.C. 
299b–22(i). 
We propose to amend paragraph (1) of 
the definition of ‘‘health care 
operations’’ to include a reference to 
patient safety activities, as defined in 
the PSQIA implementing regulation at 
42 CFR 3.20. Many health care 
providers participating in the voluntary 
patient safety program authorized by 
PSQIA are HIPAA covered entities; 
PSQIA acknowledges that such 
providers must also comply with the 
Privacy Rule and deems patient safety 
activities to be health care operations 
under the Privacy Rule. While such 
activities are already encompassed 
within paragraph (1) of the definition, 
which addresses various quality 
activities, we propose to expressly 
include patient safety activities within 
paragraph (1) of the definition of health 
care operations to expressly conform the 
definition to PSQIA and to eliminate the 
potential for any confusion. This 
modification would also address public 
comments the Department received 
during the rulemaking period for the 
PSQIA implementing regulations, which 
urged the Department to modify the 
definition of ‘‘health care operations’’ in 
the Privacy Rule to expressly reference 
patient safety activities so that the 
intersection of the Privacy and PSQIA 
Rules would be clear. See 73 FR 70732, 
70780, November 21, 2008. 
2. Definition of ‘‘Marketing’’ 
The Privacy Rule requires covered 
entities to obtain a valid authorization 
from individuals before using or 
disclosing protected health information 
to market a product or service to them. 
See § 164.508(a)(3). Section 164.501 
defines ‘‘marketing’’ as making a 
communication about a product or 
service that encourages recipients of the 
communication to purchase or use the 
product or service. Paragraph (1) of the 
definition includes a number of 
exceptions to marketing for certain 
health-related communications. In 
particular, the Privacy Rule does not 
consider the following communications 
to be marketing: (1) Communications 
made to describe a health-related 
product or service (or payment for such 
product or service) that is provided by, 
or included in a plan of benefits of, the 
covered entity making the 
communications, including 
communications about: the entities 
participating in a healthcare provider 
network or health plan network; 
replacement of, or enhancements to, a 
health plan; and health-related products 
or services available only to a health 
plan enrollee that add value to, but are 
not part of, a plan of benefits; (2) 
communications made for the treatment 
of the individual; and (3) 
communications for case management 
or care coordination for the individual, 
or to direct or recommend alternative 
treatments, therapies, health care 
providers, or settings of care to the 
individual. Thus, a covered entity is 
permitted to make these excepted 
communications without an 
individual’s authorization as either 
treatment or health care operations 
communications, as appropriate, under 
the Privacy Rule. In addition, the 
Privacy Rule does not require a covered 
entity to obtain individual authorization 
to communicate face-to-face or to 
provide only promotional gifts of 
nominal value to the individual. See 
§ 164.508(a)(3)(i). However, a covered 
entity must obtain prior written 
authorization from an individual to 
send communications to the individual 
about non-health related products or 
services or to give or sell the 
individual’s protected health 
information to a third party for 
marketing. See the current paragraph (2) 
of the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ in the 
Privacy Rule. Still, concerns have 
remained about the ability under these 
provisions for a third party to pay a 
covered entity in exchange for the 
covered entity to send health-related 
communications to an individual about 
the third party’s products or services. 
Section 13406(a) of the HITECH Act, 
which became effective on February 18, 
2010, addresses these marketing 
provisions. In particular, section 
13406(a) of the HITECH Act limits the 
health-related communications that may 
be considered health care operations 
and thus, that are excepted from the 
definition of ‘‘marketing’’ under the 
Privacy Rule to the extent a covered 
entity receives or has received direct or 
indirect payment in exchange for 
making the communication. In cases 
where the covered entity would receive 
such payment, the HITECH Act at 
section 13406(a)(2)(B) requires that the 
covered entity obtain the individual’s 
valid authorization prior to making the 
communication, or, if applicable, prior 
to its business associate making the 
communication on its behalf in 
accordance with its written contract. 
Section 13406(a)(2)(A) of the HITECH 
Act includes an exception to the 
payment limitation for communications 
that describe only a drug or biologic that 
is currently being prescribed to the 
individual as long as any payment 
received by the covered entity in 
exchange for making the 
communication is reasonable in 
amount. Section 13406(a)(3) of the Act 
provides that the term ‘‘reasonable in 
amount’’ shall have the meaning given 
such term by the Secretary in regulation. 
Finally, section 13406(a)(4) of the Act 
clarifies that ‘‘direct or indirect 
payment’’ does not include any payment 
for treatment of the individual. We 
believe Congress intended with these 
provisions to curtail a covered entity’s 
ability to use the exceptions to the 
definition of ‘‘marketing’’ in the Privacy 
Rule to send communications to the 
individual that were motivated more by 
commercial gain or other commercial 
purpose rather than for the purpose of 
the individual’s health care, despite the 
communication’s being about a health- 
related product or service. 
To implement the marketing 
limitations of the HITECH Act, we 
propose a number of modifications to 
the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ in the 
Privacy Rule at § 164.501. In particular, 
we propose to: (1) Revise the exceptions 
to marketing to better distinguish the 
exceptions for treatment 
communications from those 
communications made for health care 
operations; (2) add a definition of 
‘‘financial remuneration;’’ (3) provide 
that health care operations 
communications for which financial 
remuneration is received are marketing 
and require individual authorization; (4) 
provide that written treatment 
communications for which financial 
remuneration is received are subject to 
certain notice and opt out conditions set 
out at § 164.514(f)(2); (5) provide a 
limited exception from the 
remuneration prohibition for refill 
reminders; and (6) remove the 
paragraph regarding an arrangement 
between a covered entity and another

40885 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
entity in which the covered entity 
receives remuneration in exchange for 
protected health information. We 
propose to revise §§ 164.514(f)(2) and 
164.520(b)(1)(iii)(A) to include the 
notice and opt out conditions that 
would attach to written treatment 
communications about products or 
services sent by a health care provider 
to an individual in exchange for 
financial remuneration by the third 
party whose product or service is being 
described. We also propose to make a 
conforming change to the authorization 
requirements for marketing at 
§ 164.508(a)(3)(ii). We describe these 
proposed modifications in more detail 
below. 
In paragraph (1) of the definition of 
‘‘marketing,’’ we propose to maintain the 
general concept that ‘‘marketing’’ means 
‘‘to make a communication about a 
product or service that encourages 
recipients of the communication to 
purchase or use the product or service.’’ 
In paragraph (2) of the definition, we 
propose to include three exceptions to 
this definition to encompass certain 
treatment and health care operations 
communications about health-related 
products or services. First, at proposed 
paragraph (2)(iii), we would exclude 
from the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ 
certain health care operations 
communications, except where, as 
provided by section 13406(a)(2) of the 
HITECH Act, the covered entity receives 
financial remuneration in exchange for 
making the communication. This 
provision would encompass the health 
care operations activities currently 
described in paragraph (1)(i) of the 
definition of ‘‘marketing,’’ which include 
communications to describe a health- 
related product or service (or payment 
for such product or service) that is 
provided by, or included in a plan of 
benefits of, the covered entity making 
the communication. In addition, the 
provision would encompass health care 
operations communications for case 
management or care coordination, 
contacting of individuals with 
information about treatment 
alternatives, and related functions, to 
the extent these activities do not fall 
within the definition of treatment. 
These are activities that currently fall 
within paragraph (1)(iii) of the 
definition of ‘‘marketing.’’ 
Although the HITECH Act uses the 
term ‘‘direct or indirect payment’’ to 
describe the limitation on permissible 
health care operations disclosures, we 
have substituted the term ‘‘financial 
remuneration’’ to avoid confusion since 
the Privacy Rule defines and uses the 
term ‘‘payment’’ to mean payment for 
health care and since the Privacy Rule’s 
authorization requirements for 
marketing at § 164.508(a)(3) use the term 
‘‘remuneration.’’ We propose to define 
‘‘financial remuneration’’ in paragraph 
(3) of the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ to 
mean direct or indirect payment from or 
on behalf of a third party whose product 
or service is being described. We also 
propose to make clear, in accordance 
with section 13406(a)(4) of the HITECH 
Act, that financial remuneration does 
not include any direct or indirect 
payment for the treatment of an 
individual. Additionally, because the 
HITECH Act refers expressly to 
‘‘payment,’’ rather than remuneration 
more generally, we have specified that 
only the receipt of financial 
remuneration in exchange for making a 
communication, as opposed to any other 
type of remuneration, is relevant for 
purposes of the definition of marketing. 
We propose a small conforming change 
to § 164.508(a)(3) to add the term 
‘‘financial’’ before ‘‘remuneration’’ and to 
refer to the definition of ‘‘financial 
remuneration’’ for consistency with the 
HITECH Act and the proposed changes 
to the definition of ‘‘marketing.’’ 
We also emphasize that financial 
remuneration for purposes of the 
definition of ‘‘marketing’’ must be in 
exchange for making the 
communication itself and be from or on 
behalf of the entity whose product or 
service is being described. For example, 
authorization would be required prior to 
a covered entity making a 
communication to its patients regarding 
the acquisition of new state of the art 
medical equipment if the equipment 
manufacturer paid the covered entity to 
send the communication to its patients. 
In contrast, an authorization would not 
be required if a local charitable 
organization, such as a breast cancer 
foundation, funded the covered entity’s 
mailing to patients about the availability 
of new state of the art medical 
equipment, such as mammography 
screening equipment, since the covered 
entity would not be receiving 
remuneration by or on behalf of the 
entity whose product or service was 
being described. Furthermore, it would 
not constitute marketing and no 
authorization would be required if a 
hospital sent flyers to its patients 
announcing the opening of a new wing 
where the funds for the new wing were 
donated by a third party, since the 
financial remuneration to the hospital 
from the third party was not in 
exchange for the mailing of the flyers. 
Second, in paragraph (2)(ii) of the 
definition, we propose to include the 
statutory exception to marketing at 
section 13406(a)(2)(A) for 
communications regarding refill 
reminders or otherwise about a drug or 
biologic that is currently being 
prescribed for the individual, provided 
any financial remuneration received by 
the covered entity for making the 
communication is reasonably related to 
the covered entity’s cost of making the 
communication. Congress expressly 
identified these types of 
communications as being exempt from 
the remuneration limitation only to the 
extent that any payment received for 
making the communication is 
reasonable in amount. We request 
comment on the scope of this exception, 
that is, whether communications about 
drugs that are related to the drug 
currently being prescribed, such as 
communications regarding generic 
alternatives or new formulations of the 
drug, should fall within the exception. 
In addition, we considered proposing a 
requirement that a covered entity could 
only receive financial remuneration for 
making such a communication to the 
extent it did not exceed the actual cost 
to make the communication. However, 
we were concerned that such a 
requirement would impose the 
additional burden of calculating the 
costs of making each communication. 
Instead, we propose to allow costs that 
are reasonably related to the covered 
entity’s cost of making the 
communication. We request comment 
on the types and amount of costs that 
should be allowed under this provision. 
Third, proposed paragraph (2)(i) 
would exclude from marketing 
treatment communications about health- 
related products or services by a health 
care provider to an individual, 
including communications for case 
management or care coordination for the 
individual, or to direct or recommend 
alternative treatments, therapies, health 
care providers, or settings of care to the 
individual, provided, however, that if 
the communications are in writing and 
financial remuneration is received in 
exchange for making the 
communications, certain notice and opt 
out conditions are met. We note that 
while section 13406(a) of the HITECH 
Act expressly provides that a 
communication to an individual about a 
health-related product or service where 
the covered entity receives payment 
from a third party in exchange for 
making the communication shall not be 
considered a health care operation 
(emphasis added) under the Privacy 
Rule, and thus is marketing, it is unclear 
how Congress intended these provisions 
to apply to treatment communications 
between a health care provider and a 
patient. Specifically, it is unclear 
whether Congress intended to restrict

only those subsidized communications 
about products and services that are less 
essential to an individual’s health care 
(i.e., those classified as health care 
operations communications) or all 
subsidized communications about 
products and services, including 
treatment communications. Given this 
ambiguity and to avoid preventing 
communications to the individual by a 
health care provider about health 
related products or services that are 
necessary for the treatment of the 
individual, we do not propose to require 
individual authorization where 
financial remuneration is received by 
the provider from a third party in 
exchange for sending the individual 
treatment communications about health- 
related products or services. However, 
to ensure the individual is aware that he 
or she may receive subsidized treatment 
communications from his or her 
provider and has the opportunity to 
elect not to receive them, we propose to 
require a statement in the notice of 
privacy practices when a provider 
intends to send such subsidized 
treatment communications to an 
individual, as well as the opportunity 
for the individual to opt out of receiving 
such communications. In particular, the 
proposed rule would exclude from 
marketing and the authorization 
requirements written subsidized 
treatment communications only to the 
extent that the following requirements 
proposed at § 164.514(f)(2) are met: (1) 
The covered health care provider’s 
notice of privacy practices includes a 
statement informing individuals that the 
provider may send treatment 
communications to the individual 
concerning treatment alternatives or 
other health-related products or services 
where the provider receives financial 
remuneration from a third party in 
exchange for making the 
communication, and the individual has 
a right to opt out of receiving such 
communications; and (2) the treatment 
communication itself discloses the fact 
of remuneration and provides the 
individual with a clear and conspicuous 
opportunity to elect not to receive any 
further such communications. Similar to 
the modifications discussed below 
regarding fundraising communications, 
the opt out method provided to an 
individual for subsidized treatment 
communications may not cause the 
individual to incur an undue burden or 
more than a nominal cost. We encourage 
covered entities to consider the use of 
a toll-free phone number, an e-mail 
address, or similar opt out mechanism 
that would provide individuals with a 
simple, quick, and inexpensive way to 
opt out of receiving future 
communications. We note that we 
would consider requiring individuals to 
write and send a letter to the covered 
entity asking not to receive future 
communications to constitute an undue 
burden on the individual for purposes 
of this proposed requirement. We 
request comment on how the opt out 
should apply to future subsidized 
treatment communications. For 
example, we request comment on 
whether the opt out should prevent all 
future subsidized treatment 
communications by the provider or just 
those dealing with the particular 
product or service described in the 
current communication. We also request 
comment on the workability of requiring 
health care providers that intend to send 
subsidized treatment communications 
to individuals to provide an individual 
with the opportunity to opt out of 
receiving such communications prior to 
the individual receiving the first 
communication and what mechanisms 
could be put into place to implement 
the requirement. 
Given that the new marketing 
limitations on the receipt of 
remuneration by a covered entity would 
apply differently depending on whether 
a communication is for treatment or 
health care operations purposes, it is 
important to emphasize the difference 
between the two types of 
communications. We note first that 
communications by health plans 
concerning health-related products or 
services included in a plan of benefits 
or for case management or care 
coordination are never considered 
treatment for purposes of the Privacy 
Rule but rather would always be health 
care operations and require individual 
authorization under the proposed rule if 
financial remuneration is involved. 
With respect to subsidized 
communications by a health care 
provider about health-related products 
or services for case management or care 
coordination or to recommend 
alternative treatments or settings of care, 
whether the communication would 
require individual authorization, or a 
statement in the notice and an 
opportunity to opt out, would depend 
on to what extent the provider is making 
the communication in a population- 
based fashion (health care operations) or 
to further the treatment of a particular 
individual based on that individual’s 
health care status or condition 
(treatment). For example, a covered 
health care provider who sends a 
pregnant patient a brochure 
recommending a specific birthing center 
suited to the patient’s particular needs 
is recommending a setting of care 
specific to the individual’s condition, 
which constitutes treatment of the 
individual. If the health care provider 
receives financial remuneration in 
exchange for making the 
communication, the provider would be 
required to have included a statement in 
its notice of privacy practices informing 
individuals that it may send subsidized 
treatment communications to the 
individual and that the individual has a 
right to opt out of such 
communications, and to disclose the 
fact of remuneration with the 
communication and provide the 
individual with information on how to 
opt out of receiving future such 
communications. In contrast, a health 
care provider who sends a blanket 
mailing to all patients with information 
about a new affiliated physical therapy 
practice would not be making a 
treatment communication. Rather, the 
provider would be making a 
communication for health care 
operations if it does not receive any 
financial remuneration for the 
communication, but would be making a 
communication for marketing if it does 
receive financial remuneration. 
We are aware of the difficulty in 
making what may be in some cases close 
judgments as to which communications 
are for treatment purposes and which 
are for health care operations purposes. 
We also are aware of the need to avoid 
unintended adverse consequences to a 
covered health care provider’s ability to 
provide treatment to an individual. 
Therefore, we request comment on the 
above proposal with regard to these 
issues, as well as the alternatives of 
excluding treatment communications 
altogether even if they involve financial 
remuneration from a third party or 
requiring individual authorization for 
both treatment and health care 
operations communications made in 
exchange for financial remuneration. 
We note that face to face 
communications about products or 
services between a covered entity and 
an individual and promotional gifts of 
nominal value provided by a covered 
entity are not impacted by these 
proposed changes to the definition of 
‘‘marketing.’’ These communications 
may continue to be made without 
obtaining an authorization under 
§ 164.508 or meeting the notice and opt 
out requirements of § 164.514(f)(2). We 
also clarify that communications made 
by covered entities to individuals 
promoting health in general, such as 
communications about the importance 
of maintaining a healthy diet or getting 
an annual physical are still not 
considered to be marketing. These types

4 We propose to reserve § 164.502(a)(3) for 
provisions implementing modifications to the 
Privacy Rule required by the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which were 
proposed on October 7, 2009. See 74 FR 51698. 
of communications do not constitute 
marketing because they are not 
promoting a specific product or service, 
and thus do not meet the definition of 
‘‘marketing.’’ Similarly, communications 
about government and government- 
sponsored programs do not fall within 
the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ as there is 
no commercial component to 
communications about benefits 
available through public programs. 
Finally, we have proposed to remove 
the language at paragraph (2) from the 
definition of ‘‘marketing’’ at § 164.501. 
The current language defines as 
marketing an arrangement between a 
covered entity and any other entity in 
which the covered entity discloses 
protected health information to the 
other entity, in exchange for 
remuneration, for the other entity or its 
affiliate to make a communication about 
its own product or service that 
encourages recipients of the 
communication to purchase or use that 
product or service. This language 
describes a situation which, as 
explained more fully below, would now 
constitute a ‘‘sale’’ of protected health 
information under section 13405(d) of 
the HITECH Act and § 164.508(a)(4) of 
this proposed rule. Because we propose 
to modify § 164.508 to implement 
section 13405(d) of the HITECH Act by 
prohibiting the sale of protected health 
information without an authorization, 
we propose to remove this paragraph 
from the definition of ‘‘marketing’’ as 
unnecessary and to avoid confusion. 
C. Business Associates 
1. Section 164.502—Uses and 
Disclosures 
The Privacy Rule currently does not 
directly govern business associates. 
However, the provisions of the HITECH 
Act make specific requirements of the 
Privacy Rule applicable to business 
associates, and create direct liability for 
noncompliance by business associates 
with regard to those Privacy Rule 
requirements. In particular, section 
13404 of the HITECH Act, which 
became effective February 18, 2010, 
addresses the application of the 
provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to 
business associates of covered entities. 
Section 13404(a) discusses the 
application of contract requirements to 
business associates, paragraph (b) 
applies the provision of 
§ 164.504(e)(1)(ii) regarding knowledge 
of a pattern of activity or practice that 
constitutes a material breach or 
violation of a contract to business 
associates, and paragraph (c) applies the 
HIPAA civil and criminal penalties to 
business associates. We discuss 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 13404 
of the HITECH Act below. We address 
section 13404(c) regarding the 
application of penalties to violations by 
business associates above in the 
discussion of the proposed changes to 
the Enforcement Rule. 
Section 13404(a) of the HITECH Act 
creates direct liability for business 
associates by providing that in the case 
of a business associate of a covered 
entity that obtains or creates protected 
health information pursuant to a written 
contract or other arrangement as 
described in § 164.502(e)(2) of the 
Privacy Rule, the business associate may 
use and disclose such protected health 
information only if such use or 
disclosure is in compliance with the 
applicable business associate contract 
requirements of § 164.504(e) of the Rule. 
Additionally, section 13404(a) applies 
the other privacy requirements of the 
HITECH Act to business associates just 
as they apply to covered entities. 
Accordingly, we propose to modify 
§ 164.502(a) of the Privacy Rule 
containing the general rules for uses and 
disclosures of protected health 
information to address the permitted 
and required uses and disclosures of 
protected health information by 
business associates. First, we propose to 
revise § 164.502(a) to provide that a 
business associate, like a covered entity, 
may not use or disclose protected health 
information except as permitted or 
required by the Privacy Rule or the 
Enforcement Rule. Second, we propose 
to revise the titles of § 164.502(a)(1) and 
(2) regarding permitted and required 
uses and disclosures to make clear that 
these paragraphs apply only to covered 
entities. Note that in § 164.502(a)(2)(ii), 
we also propose a technical change to 
replace the term ‘‘subpart’’ with 
‘‘subchapter’’ to make clear that a 
covered entity is required to disclose 
protected health information to the 
Secretary as needed to determine 
compliance with any of the HIPAA 
Rules and not just the Privacy Rule. 
Third, we propose to add new 
provisions at § 164.502(a)(4) and (5) to 
address the permitted and required uses 
and disclosures of protected health 
information by business associates.4 In 
accordance with section 13404(a) of the 
HITECH Act, proposed § 164.502(a)(4) 
would allow business associates to use 
or disclose protected health information 
only as permitted or required by their 
business associate contracts or other 
arrangements pursuant to § 164.504(e), 
or as required by law. If a covered entity 
and business associate have failed to 
enter into a business associate contract 
or other arrangement, then the business 
associate may use or disclose protected 
health information only as necessary to 
perform its obligations for the covered 
entity (pursuant to whatever agreement 
sets the general terms for the 
relationship between the covered entity 
and business associate) or as required by 
law; any other use or disclosure would 
violate the Privacy Rule. In addition, 
proposed § 164.502(a)(4) makes clear 
that a business associate would not be 
permitted to use or disclose protected 
health information in a manner that 
would violate the requirements of the 
Privacy Rule, if done by the covered 
entity, except that the business associate 
would be permitted to use or disclose 
protected health information for the 
purposes specified under 
§ 164.504(e)(2)(i)(A) or (B), pertaining to 
uses and disclosures for the proper 
management and administration of the 
business associate and the provision of 
data aggregation services for the covered 
entity, if such uses and disclosures are 
permitted by its business associate 
contract or other arrangement. 
Section 164.502(a)(5) would require 
business associates to disclose protected 
health information either when required 
by the Secretary under subpart C of part 
160 of this subchapter to investigate or 
determine the business associate’s 
compliance with this subchapter, or to 
the covered entity, individual, or 
individual’s designee, as necessary to 
satisfy a covered entity’s obligations 
under § 164.524(c)(2)(ii) and (3)(ii), as 
modified, with respect to an 
individual’s request for an electronic 
copy of protected health information. As 
section 13405(e) requires covered 
entities that maintain protected health 
information in an electronic health 
record to provide an individual, or the 
individual’s designee, with a copy of 
such information in an electronic 
format, if the individual so chooses, and 
as section 13404(a) applies section 
13405(e) to business associates as well, 
we propose to include such language in 
§ 164.502(a)(5). 
We propose to modify the minimum 
necessary standard at § 164.502(b) to 
require that when business associates 
use, disclose, or request protected 
health information, they limit protected 
health information to the minimum 
necessary to accomplish the intended 
purpose of the use, disclosure, or 
request. Applying the minimum 
necessary standard is a condition of the 
permissibility of many uses and 
disclosures of protected health 
information. Thus, a business associate

is not making a permitted use or 
disclosure under the Privacy Rule if it 
does not apply the minimum necessary 
standard, where appropriate. 
Additionally, the HITECH Act at section 
13405(b) addresses the application of 
minimum necessary and, in accordance 
with section 13404(a), also applies such 
requirements to business associates. We 
note that we have not added references 
to ‘‘business associate’’ to other 
provisions of the Privacy Rule that 
address uses and disclosures by covered 
entities. This is because we found such 
changes to be unnecessary, since a 
business associate generally may only 
use or disclose protected health 
information in the same manner as a 
covered entity (therefore any Privacy 
Rule limitation on how a covered entity 
may use or disclose protected health 
information automatically extends to 
business associates). 
Section 164.502(e) sets out the 
requirements for disclosures to business 
associates. We propose in 
§ 164.502(e)(1)(i) to provide that covered 
entities are not required to obtain 
satisfactory assurances from business 
associates that are subcontractors. 
Rather, as we previously discussed with 
regard to proposed modifications to the 
Security Rule pertaining to business 
associates, and as we discuss further 
below, we propose in the Privacy and 
Security Rules to require that business 
associates obtain satisfactory 
assurances, through a written contract 
or other arrangement, from 
subcontractors that provide that the 
subcontractor will comply with the 
applicable requirements of the Rules. 
Accordingly, each business associate 
subcontractor would be subject to the 
terms and conditions of a business 
associate agreement with a business 
associate, eliminating the need for a 
similar agreement with the covered 
entity itself. 
We also propose to move the current 
exceptions to business associates at 
§ 164.502(e)(1)(ii) to the revised 
definition of business associates found 
in § 160.103 for the reasons discussed in 
that section. 
We propose a new § 164.502(e)(1)(ii) 
that provides that a business associate 
may disclose protected health 
information to a business associate that 
is a subcontractor, and to allow the 
subcontractor to create or receive 
protected health information on behalf 
of the business associate, if the business 
associate obtains satisfactory 
assurances, in accordance with 
§ 164.504(e)(1)(i), that the subcontractor 
will appropriately safeguard the 
information. As such, the business 
associate must enter into a contract or 
other arrangement that complies with 
§ 164.504(e)(1)(i) with business 
associate subcontractors, in the same 
manner that covered entities are 
required to enter into contracts or other 
arrangements with their business 
associates. As we discussed with regard 
to the requirements of the Security Rule 
regarding business associates, we 
believe that business associates are in 
the best position to ensure that 
subcontractors comply with the 
requirements of the Privacy Rule. For 
example, a covered entity may choose to 
contract with a business associate 
(contractor) to use or disclose protected 
health information on its behalf, the 
business associate may choose to obtain 
the services of (and exchange protected 
health information with) a subcontractor 
(subcontractor 1), and that subcontractor 
may, in turn, contract with another 
subcontractor (subcontractor 2) for 
services involving protected health 
information. Under the current rules, 
the covered entity would be required to 
obtain a business associate agreement 
with the contractor, the contractor 
would have a contractual requirement to 
obtain the same satisfactory assurances 
from subcontractor 1, and subcontractor 
1 would in turn have a contractual 
requirement to obtain the same 
satisfactory assurances from 
subcontractor 2. The proposed revisions 
to the Privacy and Security Rules would 
not change the parties to the contracts. 
However, the contractor and 
subcontractors 1 and 2 all would now be 
business associates with direct liability 
under the HIPAA Rules, and would be 
required to obtain business associate 
agreements with the parties with whom 
they contract for services that involve 
access to protected health information. 
(Note, however, as discussed above with 
respect to the definition of ‘‘business 
associate,’’ direct liability under the 
HIPAA Rules attaches regardless of 
whether the contractor and 
subcontractors have entered into 
business associate agreements.) The 
proposed revisions ensure that the 
covered entity does not have a new 
obligation to enter into separate 
contracts with the business associate 
subcontractors. 
We propose to remove 
§ 164.502(e)(1)(iii), which provides that 
a covered entity that violates the 
satisfactory assurances it provided as a 
business associate of another covered 
entity will be in noncompliance with 
the Privacy Rule’s business associate 
provisions, given that new proposed 
§ 164.502(a)(4) would restrict directly 
the uses and disclosures of protected 
health information by a business 
associate, including a covered entity 
acting as a business associate, to those 
uses and disclosures permitted by its 
business associate agreement. 
2. Section 164.504(e)—Business 
Associate Agreements 
Section 164.504, among other 
provisions, contains the specific 
requirements for business associate 
contracts and other arrangements. As 
discussed previously, section 13404 of 
the HITECH Act provides that a 
business associate may use and disclose 
protected health information only if 
such use or disclosure is in compliance 
with each applicable requirement of 
§ 164.504(e), and also applies the 
provisions of § 164.504(e)(1)(ii), which 
outline the actions that must be taken if 
the business associate has knowledge of 
a breach of the contract, to business 
associates. We propose a number of 
modifications to this section to 
implement these provisions and to 
reflect the Department’s new regulatory 
authority with respect to business 
associates, as well as to reflect a covered 
entity’s and business associate’s new 
obligations under subpart D to provide 
for notification in the case of breaches 
of unsecured protected health 
information. 
Section 164.504(e)(1)(ii) provides that 
a covered entity is not in compliance 
with the business associate 
requirements if the covered entity knew 
of a pattern of activity or practice of the 
business associate that constituted a 
material breach or violation of the 
business associate’s obligation under the 
contract or other arrangement, unless 
the covered entity took reasonable steps 
to cure the breach or end the violation, 
as applicable, and if such steps were 
unsuccessful, terminated the contract or 
arrangement or, if termination is not 
feasible, reported the problem to the 
Secretary. We propose to revise 
§ 164.504(e)(1)(ii) to remove the 
requirement that covered entities report 
to the Secretary when termination of a 
business associate contract is not 
feasible. In light of a business associate’s 
direct liability for civil money penalties 
for violations of the HIPAA Rules and 
both a covered entity’s and business 
associate’s obligations under subpart D 
to report breaches of unsecured 
protected health information to the 
Secretary, we have other mechanisms 
through which we expect to learn of 
such breaches and misuses of protected 
health information by a business 
associate. We also propose to add a new 
provision at § 164.504(e)(1)(iii) 
applicable to business associates with 
respect to subcontractors to mirror the 
requirements on covered entities in

40889 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
§ 164.504(e)(1)(ii) (minus the 
requirement to report to the Secretary if 
termination of a contract is not feasible). 
Thus, proposed § 164.504(e)(1)(iii) 
would require a business associate, if it 
knew of a pattern or practice of activity 
of its business associate subcontractor 
that constituted a material breach or 
violation of the subcontractor’s contract 
or other arrangement, to take reasonable 
steps to cure the breach of the 
subcontractor or to terminate the 
contract, if feasible. We believe this 
proposed provision would implement 
the intent of section 13404(b) of the 
HITECH Act, and aligns the 
requirements for business associates 
with regard to business associate 
subcontractors with the requirements 
for covered entities with regard to their 
business associates. In other words, a 
business associate that is aware of 
noncompliance by its business associate 
subcontractor must respond to the 
situation in the same manner as a 
covered entity that is aware of 
noncompliance by its business 
associate. 
While business associates are now 
directly liable for civil money penalties 
under the HIPAA Rules for 
impermissible uses and disclosures as 
described above, business associates are 
still contractually liable to covered 
entities pursuant to their business 
associate contracts, as provided for and 
required by § 164.504(e). We propose 
certain modifications to these contract 
requirements. First, we propose to 
revise § 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(B) through (D) 
to require the following: in (B), that 
business associates comply, where 
applicable, with the Security Rule with 
regard to electronic protected health 
information; in (C), that business 
associates report breaches of unsecured 
protected health information to covered 
entities, as required by § 164.410; and in 
(D), that, in accordance with 
§ 164.502(e)(1)(ii), business associates 
ensure that any subcontractors that 
create or receive protected health 
information on behalf of the business 
associate agree to the same restrictions 
and conditions that apply to the 
business associate with respect to such 
information. These proposed revisions 
align the requirements for the business 
associate contract with the requirements 
in the HITECH Act and elsewhere 
within the HIPAA Rules. 
Additionally with regard to business 
associate contract requirements, we 
propose to insert a new provision at 
§ 164.502(e)(2)(ii)(H) and to renumber 
the current paragraphs (H) and (I) 
accordingly. Section 
164.502(e)(2)(ii)(H), as proposed, would 
require that, to the extent the business 
associate is to carry out a covered 
entity’s obligation under this subpart, 
the business associate must comply 
with the requirements of the Privacy 
Rule that apply to the covered entity in 
the performance of such obligation. The 
HITECH Act places direct liability for 
uses and disclosures and for the other 
HITECH Act requirements on business 
associates. Beyond such direct liability, 
this provision clarifies that a business 
associate is contractually liable not only 
for uses and disclosures of protected 
health information, but also for all other 
requirements of the Privacy Rule, as 
they pertain to the performance of the 
business associate’s contract. For 
example, if a third party administrator, 
as a business associate of a group health 
plan, fails to distribute the plan’s notice 
of privacy practices to participants on a 
timely basis, the third party 
administrator would not be directly 
liable under the HIPAA Rules, but 
would be contractually liable, for the 
failure. However, we emphasize that in 
this example, even though the business 
associate is not directly liable under the 
HIPAA Rules for failure to provide the 
notice, the covered entity remains 
directly liable for failure to provide the 
individuals with its notice of privacy 
practices because it is the covered 
entity’s ultimate responsibility to do so, 
despite its having hired a business 
associate to perform the function. 
We also propose to revise 
§ 164.504(e)(3) regarding other 
arrangements for governmental entities 
to include references to the Security 
Rule requirements for business 
associates to streamline the two rules 
and, as discussed above, to avoid having 
to repeat such provisions in the Security 
Rule. 
To implement the requirements of 
sections 13404(a) of the HITECH Act, 
we propose to include a new 
§ 164.504(e)(5) that applies the 
requirements of § 164.504(e)(2) through 
(e)(4) to the contract or other 
arrangement between a business 
associate and its business associate 
subcontractor as required by 
§ 164.502(e)(1)(ii) in the same manner as 
such requirements apply to contracts or 
other arrangements between a covered 
entity and its business associate. As 
such, the business associate is required 
by § 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and by this section 
to enter into business associate 
contracts, or other arrangements that 
comply with the Privacy and Security 
Rules, with their business associate 
subcontractors in the same manner that 
covered entities are required to enter 
into contracts or other arrangements 
with their business associates. 
Finally, we propose to remove the 
reference to subcontractors in 
§ 164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B) to avoid confusion 
with the use of the term subcontractor 
when referring to subcontractors as 
business associates. For the same 
reason, we propose to remove the 
reference to subcontractors in 
§ 164.514(e)(4)(ii)(C)(4) to avoid 
confusion with the use of the term 
subcontractor when referring to 
subcontractors as business associates. 
We do not intend these proposed 
modifications to constitute substantive 
changes. 
3. Section 164.532—Transition 
Provisions 
We understand that covered entities 
and business associates are concerned 
with the anticipated administrative 
burden and cost to implement the 
revised business associate contract 
provisions of the Privacy and Security 
Rules. Covered entities may have 
existing contracts that are not set to 
terminate or expire until after the 
compliance date of the modifications to 
the Rules, and we understand that a six 
month compliance period may not 
provide enough time to reopen and 
renegotiate all contracts. In response to 
these concerns, we propose to relieve 
some of the burden on covered entities 
and business associates in complying 
with the revised business associate 
provisions by adding a transition 
provision to grandfather certain existing 
contracts for a specified period of time. 
The Department’s authority to add the 
transition provision is set forth in 
§ 160.104(c), which allows the Secretary 
to establish the compliance date for any 
modified standard or implementation 
specification, taking into account the 
extent of the modification and the time 
needed to comply with the 
modification. We also note that the 
Final Privacy Rule, 65 FR 82462 (Dec. 
28, 2000), and the Modifications to the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule, 67 FR 53182 (Aug. 
14, 2002), both included transition 
provisions to ensure that important 
functions of the health care system were 
not impeded (e.g., to prevent disruption 
of ongoing research). Similarly, the 
proposed transition period, here, will 
prevent rushed and hasty changes to 
thousands of on-going existing business 
associate agreements. The following 
discussion addresses the issue of the 
business associate transition provisions. 
We propose new transition provisions 
at § 164.532(d) and (e) to allow covered 
entities and business associates (and 
business associates and business 
associate subcontractors) to continue to 
operate under certain existing contracts 
for up to one year beyond the

compliance date of the revisions to the 
Rules. The additional transition period 
would be available to a covered entity 
or business associate if, prior to the 
publication date of the modified Rules, 
the covered entity or business associate 
had an existing contract or other written 
arrangement with a business associate 
or subcontractor, respectively, that 
complied with the prior provisions of 
the HIPAA Rules and such contract or 
arrangement was not renewed or 
modified between the effective date and 
the compliance date of the 
modifications to the Rules. The 
proposed provisions are intended to 
allow those covered entities and 
business associates with contracts with 
business associates and subcontractors, 
respectively, that qualify as described 
above to continue to disclose protected 
health information to the business 
associate or subcontractor, or to allow 
the business associate or subcontractor 
to create or receive protected health 
information on behalf of the covered 
entity or business associate, for up to 
one year beyond the compliance date of 
the modifications, regardless of whether 
the contract meets the applicable 
contract requirements in the 
modifications to the Rules. With respect 
to business associates and 
subcontractors, this proposal would 
grandfather existing written agreements 
between business associates and 
subcontractors entered into pursuant to 
45 CFR 164.504(e)(2)(i)(D), which 
requires the business associate to ensure 
that its agents with access to protected 
health information agree to the same 
restrictions and conditions that apply to 
the business associate. The Department 
proposes to deem such contracts to be 
compliant with the modifications to the 
Rules until either the covered entity or 
business associate has renewed or 
modified the contract following the 
compliance date of the modifications, or 
until the date that is one year after the 
compliance date, whichever is sooner. 
In cases where a contract renews 
automatically without any change in 
terms or other action by the parties (also 
known as ‘‘evergreen contracts’’), the 
Department intends that such evergreen 
contracts will be eligible for the 
extension and that deemed compliance 
would not terminate when these 
contracts automatically roll over. These 
transition provisions apply to covered 
entities and business associates only 
with respect to written contracts or 
other written arrangements as specified 
above, and not to oral contracts or other 
arrangements. 
These transition provisions only 
apply to the requirement to amend 
contracts; they do not affect any other 
compliance obligations under the 
HIPAA Rules. For example, beginning 
on the compliance date of this rule, a 
business associate may not use or 
disclose protected health information in 
a manner that is contrary to the Privacy 
Rule, even if the business associate’s 
contract with the covered entity has not 
yet been amended. 
D. Section 164.508—Uses and 
Disclosures for Which an Authorization 
is Required 
Section 164.508 of the Privacy Rule 
permits a covered entity to use and 
disclose protected health information 
only if it has obtained a valid 
authorization (i.e., one that meets the 
requirements of the section), unless 
such use or disclosure is otherwise 
permitted or required by the Privacy 
Rule. Section 164.508 also lists two 
specific circumstances in which an 
authorization must be obtained: (1) Most 
uses and disclosures of psychotherapy 
notes; and (2) uses and disclosures for 
marketing. 
1. Sale of Protected Health Information 
Section 13405(d) of the HITECH Act 
adds a third circumstance that requires 
authorization, specifically the sale of 
protected health information. Section 
13405(d)(1) prohibits a covered entity or 
business associate from receiving direct 
or indirect remuneration in exchange for 
the disclosure of protected health 
information unless the covered entity 
has obtained a valid authorization from 
the individual pursuant to § 164.508 
that states whether the protected health 
information can be further exchanged 
for remuneration by the entity receiving 
the information. Section 13405(d)(2) 
sets forth several exceptions to the 
authorization requirement. These 
exceptions are where the purpose of the 
exchange of information for 
remuneration is for: (1) Public health 
activities, as described in § 164.512(b); 
(2) research purposes as described in 
§§ 164.501 and 164.512(i), if the price 
charged for the information reflects the 
costs of preparation and transmittal of 
the data; (3) treatment of the individual; 
(4) the sale, transfer, merger, or 
consolidation of all or part of a covered 
entity and for related due diligence; 
(5) services rendered by a business 
associate pursuant to a business 
associate agreement and at the specific 
request of the covered entity; 
(6) providing an individual with access 
to his or her protected health 
information pursuant to § 164.524; and 
(7) such other purposes as the Secretary 
determines to be necessary and 
appropriate by regulation. Section 
13405(d)(4) of the Act provides that the 
prohibition on sale of protected health 
information shall apply to disclosures 
occurring 6 months after the date of the 
promulgation of final regulations 
implementing this section. 
To implement section 13405(d) of the 
HITECH Act, we propose to add new 
provisions at § 164.508(a)(4) regarding 
the sale of protected health information. 
In proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(i), we 
propose to require a covered entity to 
obtain an authorization for any 
disclosure of protected health 
information in exchange for direct or 
indirect remuneration. This 
authorization must state that the 
disclosure will result in remuneration to 
the covered entity. In proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(ii), we propose to except 
several disclosures of protected health 
information, made in exchange for 
remuneration, from this authorization 
requirement. These exceptions, as 
discussed more fully below, generally 
follow the statutory exceptions 
described in the above paragraph. 
The proposed language in 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i) generally follows the 
statutory language of section 13405(d)(1) 
in prohibiting the disclosure of 
protected health information without an 
authorization if the covered entity 
receives direct or indirect remuneration 
from or on behalf of the recipient of the 
protected health information. As 
required by the Act, this proposed 
provision would apply to business 
associates as well as to covered entities. 
We do not include language in 
proposed § 164.508(a)(4) to require that 
the authorization under § 164.508 
specify whether the protected health 
information disclosed by the covered 
entity for remuneration can be further 
exchanged for remuneration by the 
entity receiving the information. We 
believe the intent of this statutory 
language was to ensure that, as currently 
required by § 164.508 for marketing, the 
authorization include a statement as to 
whether remuneration will be received 
by the covered entity with respect to the 
disclosures subject to the authorization. 
Otherwise, the individual would not be 
put on notice that the disclosure 
involves remuneration and thus, would 
not be making an informed decision as 
to whether to sign the authorization. 
Accordingly, we propose to require that 
the § 164.508(a)(4)(i) authorization 
include a statement that the covered 
entity is receiving direct or indirect 
remuneration in exchange for the 
protected health information. This 
requirement would ensure that 
individuals can make informed 
decisions regarding whether to 
authorize disclosure of their protected 
health information when the disclosure

will result in remuneration to the 
covered entity. We also note, with 
respect to the recipient of the 
information, if protected health 
information is disclosed for 
remuneration by a covered entity or 
business associate to another covered 
entity or business associate in 
compliance with the authorization 
requirements at proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i), the recipient covered 
entity or business associate could not 
redisclose that protected health 
information in exchange for 
remuneration unless a valid 
authorization is obtained in accordance 
with proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(i) with 
respect to such redisclosure. We request 
comment on these provisions. 
In proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(ii), we set 
forth the exceptions to the authorization 
requirement of proposed paragraph 
(a)(4)(i). We propose the exceptions 
provided for by section 13405(d)(2) of 
the HITECH Act, but we also propose to 
exercise the authority granted to the 
Secretary in section 13405(d)(2)(G) to 
include an additional exception that we 
deem to be similarly necessary and 
appropriate. We invite public comment 
on the proposed exceptions to this 
authorization requirement and whether 
there are additional exceptions that 
should be included in the final 
regulation. 
The exception at proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(A) covers exchanges 
for remuneration for public health 
activities pursuant to §§ 164.512(b) or 
164.514(e). This exception largely tracks 
the statutory language; however, we 
have added a reference to § 164.514(e), 
to ensure that a covered entity or 
business associate that discloses 
protected health information for public 
health activities in limited data set form 
is also excepted from the authorization 
requirement. We believe it is consistent 
with the statutory language to also 
except the disclosure of a limited data 
set where Congress has already excepted 
the disclosure of fully identifiable 
protected health information for the 
same purpose from the remuneration 
prohibition. With respect to the 
exception for public health disclosures, 
section 13405(d)(3)(A) of the HITECH 
Act requires that the Secretary evaluate 
the impact of restricting this exception 
to require that the price charged for the 
data reflects only the costs of 
preparation and transmittal of the data 
on research or public health activities, 
including those conducted by or for the 
use of the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). Section 
13405(d)(3)(B) further provides that if 
the Secretary finds that such further 
restriction will not impede such 
activities, the Secretary may include the 
restriction in the regulations. While we 
do not propose to include such a 
restriction on the remuneration that may 
be received for disclosures for public 
health purposes at this time, we request 
public comment on this issue to assist 
us in evaluating the impact of any such 
restriction. 
The proposed exception at 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(B) generally tracks the 
statutory language and excepts from the 
authorization requirement disclosures of 
protected health information for 
research purposes, pursuant to 
§§ 164.512(i) or 164.514(e), in which the 
covered entity receives remuneration, as 
long as the remuneration received by 
the covered entity is a reasonable, cost- 
based fee to cover the cost to prepare 
and transmit the information for 
research purposes. We request public 
comment on the types of costs that 
should be permitted under this 
provision. As discussed above with 
respect to the exception for public 
health activities, we also propose to add 
a reference to § 164.514(e) to ensure that 
this exception likewise applies to the 
disclosure of protected health 
information in limited data set form for 
research purposes. 
Proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(C) would 
create an exception from the 
authorization requirement for 
disclosures of protected health 
information for treatment and payment 
purposes, in which the covered entity 
receives remuneration. Though the Act 
only addressed treatment, we have 
expressly included disclosures for 
payment purposes and have also 
included reference to § 164.506(a), 
which sets forth the standard for 
disclosures of protected health 
information for treatment and payment 
purposes. We also propose to except 
disclosures made for payment for health 
care from the remuneration limitation to 
make clear that we do not consider the 
exchange of protected health 
information to obtain ‘‘payment,’’ as 
such term is defined in the Privacy Rule 
at § 164.501, to be a sale of protected 
health information and thus, subject to 
the authorization requirements in this 
section. 
Section 13405(d)(2)(D) of the HITECH 
Act excepts from the authorization 
requirement disclosures described in 
paragraph (6)(iv) of the definition of 
health care operations at § 164.501, i.e., 
disclosures for the sale, transfer, merger, 
or consolidation of all or part of a 
covered entity with another covered 
entity, or an entity that following such 
activity will become a covered entity, 
and due diligence related to such 
activity. Proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(D) 
would accordingly except from the 
authorization requirement disclosures of 
protected health information for the 
events described in paragraph (6)(iv). 
We also add a reference to § 164.506(a), 
the provision which permits a covered 
entity to disclose protected health 
information for health care operations 
purposes. 
Proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(E) would 
except from the authorization 
requirements disclosures of protected 
health information to or by a business 
associate for activities that the business 
associate undertakes on behalf of a 
covered entity pursuant to §§ 164.502(e) 
and 164.504(e), as long as the only 
remuneration provided is by the 
covered entity to the business associate 
for the performance of such activities. 
We have modified the statutory 
language to provide specific references 
to the provisions of the Privacy Rule 
that set forth the standards through 
which covered entities may make 
disclosures of protected health 
information to business associates and 
the standards for business associate 
contracts which govern the relationship 
between covered entities and their 
business associates. This proposed 
exception would exempt from the 
authorization requirement in 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i) a disclosure of 
protected health information by a 
covered entity to a business associate or 
by a business associate to a third party 
on behalf of the covered entity as long 
as any remuneration received by the 
business associate was for payment for 
the activities performed by the business 
associate pursuant to a business 
associate contract. 
Proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(F) would 
except from the authorization 
requirement disclosures of protected 
health information by a covered entity 
to an individual when requested under 
§§ 164.524 or 164.528. While section 
13405(d)(2)(F) explicitly refers only to 
disclosures under § 164.524, we are 
exercising our authority under section 
13405(d)(2)(G) of the HITECH Act 
(discussed below) to include in this 
proposed section disclosures under 
§ 164.528 as necessary and appropriate. 
Section 164.502(a)(2)(i) requires covered 
entities to disclose protected health 
information relating to an individual to 
that individual upon request pursuant 
to §§ 164.524 or 164.528. Section 
164.524 permits a covered entity to 
impose a reasonable, cost-based fee for 
the provision of access to an 
individual’s protected health 
information, upon request. Section 
164.528 requires a covered entity to 
provide a requesting individual with an 
accounting of disclosures without

charge in any 12-month period but 
permits a covered entity to impose a 
reasonable, cost-based fee for each 
subsequent request for an accounting of 
disclosures during that 12-month 
period. Therefore, as a disclosure of 
protected health information under 
§ 164.528 is similar to a disclosure 
under § 164.524 in that a covered entity 
may be paid a fee for making the 
disclosure, we have included 
disclosures pursuant to requests for 
accountings of disclosures in this 
exception. We note that this exception 
would not permit a covered entity to 
require that an individual pay a fee that 
is not otherwise permitted by §§ 164.524 
or 164.528. 
We propose an additional exception 
at § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(G), pursuant to the 
authority granted to the Secretary in 
section 13405(d)(2)(G) of the HITECH 
Act to except from the authorization 
requirements at proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i) disclosures that are 
required by law as permitted under 
§ 164.512(a). Section 164.512(a) permits 
covered entities to use or disclose 
protected health information to the 
extent that such use or disclosure is 
required by law. We propose to add this 
exception to ensure that a covered entity 
can continue to disclose protected 
health information, where required by 
law, even if the covered entity receives 
remuneration for the disclosure. We 
request comment on the inclusion of 
such an exception. 
Finally, we propose an additional 
exception at § 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(H), 
pursuant to the authority granted to the 
Secretary in section 13405(d)(2)(G), to 
except from the authorization 
requirements at proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i) a disclosure of 
protected health information for any 
other purpose permitted by and in 
accordance with the applicable 
requirements of subpart E, as long as the 
only remuneration received by the 
covered entity is a reasonable, cost- 
based fee to cover the cost to prepare 
and transmit the protected health 
information for such purpose or is a fee 
otherwise expressly permitted by other 
law. We have included this proposed 
exception as necessary and appropriate 
to ensure that the proposed 
authorization requirement does not 
deter covered entities from disclosing 
protected health information for 
permissible purposes under subpart E 
just because they routinely receive 
payment equal to the cost of preparing, 
producing, or transmitting the protected 
health information. We emphasize that 
this exception would not apply if a 
covered entity received remuneration 
above the actual cost incurred to 
prepare, produce, or transmit the 
protected health information for the 
permitted purpose, unless such fee is 
expressly permitted by other law. 
We recognize that many States have 
laws in place to limit the fees a health 
care provider can charge to prepare, 
copy, and transmit medical records. 
Some States simply require any 
reasonable costs incurred by the 
provider in making copies of the 
medical records to be paid for by the 
requesting party, while other States set 
forth specific cost limitations with 
respect to retrieval, labor, supplies, and 
copying costs and allow charges equal 
to actual mailing or shipping costs. 
Many of these State laws set different 
cost limitations based on the amount 
and type of information to be provided, 
taking into account whether the 
information is in paper or electronic 
form as well as whether the requested 
material includes x-rays, films, disks, 
tapes, or other diagnostic imaging. We 
intend that the reference in proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(H) to fees expressly 
permitted by other laws to include fees 
permitted by such State laws. Therefore, 
if a covered entity discloses protected 
health information in exchange for 
remuneration that conforms to an 
applicable State law with respect to 
such fees, the exception would apply 
and no authorization pursuant to 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(i) would be required. We 
do note, however, that of the States that 
do have such laws in place, there is 
great variation regarding the types of 
document preparation activities for 
which a provider can charge as well as 
the permissible fee schedules for such 
preparation activities. We invite public 
comment on our proposal to include in 
§ 164.508(a)(4)(ii)(H) a general exception 
for disclosures made for permissible 
purposes for which the covered entity 
received remuneration that was 
consistent with applicable State law. 
We propose a conforming change to 
§ 164.508(b)(1)(i) to include a reference 
to the authorization requirement in 
proposed § 164.508(a)(4)(i). 
2. Research 
a. Compound Authorizations 
Section 164.508(b)(4) of the Privacy 
Rule prohibits covered entities from 
conditioning treatment, payment, 
enrollment in a health plan, or 
eligibility for benefits on the provision 
of an authorization. This limitation is 
intended to prevent covered entities 
from coercing individuals into signing 
an authorization for a use or disclosure 
that is not necessary to carry out the 
services that the covered entity provides 
to the individual. However, this section 
permits a covered entity to condition 
the provision of research-related 
treatment on obtaining the individual’s 
authorization in limited situations, such 
as for a clinical trial. Permitting the use 
of protected health information is part 
of the decision to receive care through 
a clinical trial, and health care providers 
conducting such trials are able to 
condition research-related treatment on 
the individual’s willingness to authorize 
the use or disclosure of protected health 
information for research associated with 
the trial. 
Section 164.508(b)(3) generally 
prohibits what are termed ‘‘compound 
authorizations,’’ i.e., where an 
authorization for the use and disclosure 
of protected health information is 
combined with any other legal 
permission. However, § 164.508(b)(3)(i) 
carves out an exception to this general 
prohibition, permitting the combining of 
an authorization for a research study 
with any other written permission for 
the same study, including another 
authorization or consent to participate 
in the research. Nonetheless, 
§ 164.508(b)(3)(iii) prohibits combining 
an authorization that conditions 
treatment, payment, enrollment in a 
health plan, or eligibility for benefits 
with an authorization for another 
purpose for which treatment, payment, 
enrollment, or eligibility may not be 
conditioned. This limitation on certain 
compound authorizations was intended 
to help ensure that individuals 
understand that they may decline the 
activity described in the unconditioned 
authorization yet still receive treatment 
or other benefits or services by agreeing 
to the conditioned authorization. 
The impact of these authorization 
requirements and limitations can be 
seen during clinical trials that are 
associated with a corollary research 
activity, such as when protected health 
information is used or disclosed to 
create or to contribute to a central 
research database or repository. For 
example, § 164.508(b)(3)(iii) prevents 
covered entities from obtaining a single 
authorization for the use or disclosure of 
protected health information for a 
research study that includes both 
treatment as part of a clinical trial and 
tissue banking of specimens (and 
associated protected health information) 
collected, since a research-related 
treatment authorization generally is 
conditioned and a tissue banking 
authorization generally is not 
conditioned. Various groups, including 
researchers and professional 
organizations, have expressed concern 
at this lack of integration. The 
Secretary’s Advisory Committee for 
Human Research Protections in 2004

40893 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
(Recommendation V, in a letter to the 
Secretary of HHS, available at http:// 
www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/ 
hipaalettertosecy090104.html), as well 
as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 
2009 Report, ‘‘Beyond the HIPAA 
Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, 
Improving Health Through Research’’ 
(Recommendation II.B.2), also made 
specific recommendations to allow 
combined authorizations for clinical 
trials and biospecimen storage. 
Research-related treatment offered 
through a clinical trial is nearly always 
conditioned upon signing the informed 
consent to participate in the trial and 
the authorization to use or disclose the 
individual’s protected health 
information for the trial. Thus, covered 
entities must obtain separate 
authorizations from research 
participants for a clinical trial that also 
collects specimens with associated 
protected health information for a 
central repository. For clinical research 
trials that may have thousands of 
participants, documenting and storing 
twice as many authorizations is a major 
concern. There is also a concern that 
multiple forms may be confusing for 
research subjects. The Department has 
received reports that recruitment into 
clinical trials has been hampered, in 
part, because the multiplicity of forms 
for research studies dissuades 
individuals from participating in 
research. We have also heard that 
redundant information provided by two 
authorization forms (one for the clinical 
study and another for related research) 
diverts an individual’s attention from 
other content that describes how and 
why the personal health information 
may be used. 
While seeking Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) or Privacy Board waiver of 
the authorization requirement is an 
option under § 164.512 of the Privacy 
Rule, an IRB or Privacy Board is less 
likely to approve a request for a waiver 
of authorization for a foreseeable use or 
disclosure of protected health 
information to create and maintain or 
contribute to a central tissue or 
information repository if the covered 
entity is planning to seek informed 
consent from the individual for this 
purpose. Accordingly, the waiver 
provisions generally do not resolve 
concerns expressed by the research 
community. 
We agree that allowing a covered 
provider to combine research 
authorizations would streamline the 
process for obtaining an individual’s 
authorization for research and would 
make the documentation 
responsibilities of these covered entities 
more manageable. Such a modification 
would also result in an authorization 
that would be simpler and, therefore, 
more meaningful to the individual (in 
contrast to the individual receiving 
multiple forms that may be confusing). 
We, therefore, propose to amend 
§ 164.508(b)(3)(i) and (iii) to allow a 
covered entity to combine conditioned 
and unconditioned authorizations for 
research, provided that the 
authorization clearly differentiates 
between the conditioned and 
unconditioned research components 
and clearly allows the individual the 
option to opt in to the unconditioned 
research activities. These provisions 
would allow covered entities to 
combine authorizations for scenarios 
that often occur in research studies. For 
example, a covered entity would be able 
to combine an authorization permitting 
the use and disclosure of protected 
health information associated with a 
specimen collection for a central 
repository and authorization permitting 
use and disclosure of protected health 
information for clinical research that 
conditions research-related treatment on 
the execution of a HIPAA authorization. 
While the proposed modifications do 
not alter the core elements or required 
statements integral to a valid 
authorization, covered entities would 
have some flexibility with respect to 
how they met the authorization 
requirements. For example, covered 
entities could facilitate an individual’s 
understanding of a compound 
authorization by describing the 
unconditioned research activity on a 
separate page of a compound 
authorization. They could also cross- 
reference relevant sections of a 
compound authorization to minimize 
the potential for redundant language. In 
addition, a covered entity could use a 
separate check-box for the 
unconditioned research activity to 
signify whether an individual has 
opted-in to the unconditioned research 
activity, while maintaining one 
signature line for the authorization. 
Alternatively, a covered entity could 
choose to provide a distinct signature 
line for the unconditioned authorization 
to signal that the individual is 
authorizing optional research that will 
not affect research-related treatment. We 
request comment on additional methods 
that would clearly differentiate to the 
individual the conditioned and 
unconditioned research activities on the 
compound authorization. 
b. Authorizing Future Research Use or 
Disclosure 
Research often involves obtaining 
health information and biological 
specimens to create a research database 
or repository for future research. For 
example, this frequently occurs where 
clinical trials are paired with corollary 
research activities, such as the creation 
of a research database or repository 
where information and specimens 
obtained from a research participant 
during the trial are transferred and 
maintained for future research. It also is 
our understanding that IRBs in some 
cases may approve an informed consent 
document for a clinical trial that also 
asks research participants to permit 
future research on their identifiable 
information or specimens obtained 
during the course of the trial, or may 
review an informed consent for a prior 
clinical trial to determine whether a 
subsequent research use is encompassed 
within the original consent. 
The Department has interpreted the 
Privacy Rule, however, to require that 
authorizations for research be study 
specific for purposes of complying with 
the Rule’s requirement at 
§ 164.508(c)(1)(iv) that an authorization 
must include a description of each 
purpose of the requested use or 
disclosure. See 67 FR 53182, 53226, 
Aug. 14, 2002. In part, the Department’s 
interpretation was based on a concern 
that patients could lack necessary 
information in the authorization to 
make an informed decision about the 
future research, due to a lack of 
information about the future research at 
the time the authorization was obtained. 
In addition, it was recognized that not 
all uses and disclosures of protected 
health information for a future research 
purpose would require a covered entity 
to re-contact the individual to obtain 
another authorization, to the extent 
other conditions in the Privacy Rule 
were met. For example, a covered entity 
could obtain a waiver of authorization 
from an IRB or Privacy Board as 
provided under § 164.512(i) or use or 
disclose only a limited data set pursuant 
to a data use agreement under 
§ 164.514(e) for the future research 
purpose. 
Subsequent to its issuing this 
interpretation, the Department has 
heard concerns from covered entities 
and researchers that the Department’s 
interpretation encumbers secondary 
research, and limits an individual’s 
ability to agree to the use or disclosure 
of their protected health information for 
future research without having to be re- 
contacted to sign multiple authorization 
forms at different points in the future. 
In addition, many commenters noted 
that the Department’s interpretation 
limiting the scope of a HIPAA 
authorization for research appeared to 
diverge from the current practice under 
the Common Rule with respect to the

ability of a researcher to seek subjects’ 
consent to future research so long as the 
future research uses are described in 
sufficient detail to allow an informed 
consent. These commenters, as well as 
the Secretary’s Advisory Committee for 
Human Research Protections in 2004 
(Recommendation IV, in a letter to the 
Secretary of HHS, available at http:// 
www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/ 
hipaalettertosecy090104.html) and the 
IOM in its 2009 Report entitled ‘‘Beyond 
the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing 
Privacy, Improving Health Through 
Research’’ (Recommendation II.B.1), 
have urged the Department to allow the 
HIPAA authorization to permit future 
research use and disclosure of protected 
health information or, at a minimum, for 
the Department to modify its 
interpretation to allow the authorization 
to encompass certain future use and 
disclosure of protected health 
information for research, provided 
certain parameters are met. 
Given these concerns, in addition to 
the modifications mentioned in the 
prior section, the Department is 
considering whether to modify its 
interpretation that an authorization for 
the use or disclosure of protected health 
information for research be research- 
study specific. In particular, the 
Department is considering a number of 
options and issues in this area, 
including whether: (1) The Privacy Rule 
should permit an authorization for uses 
and disclosures of protected health 
information for future research purposes 
to the extent such purposes are 
adequately described in the 
authorization such that it would be 
reasonable for the individual to expect 
that his or her protected health 
information could be used or disclosed 
for such future research; (2) the Privacy 
Rule should permit an authorization for 
future research only to the extent the 
description of the future research 
included certain elements or statements 
specified by the Privacy Rule, and if so, 
what should those be; and (3) the 
Privacy Rule should permit option (1) as 
a general rule but require certain 
disclosure statements on the 
authorization in cases where the future 
research may encompass certain types 
of sensitive research activities, such as 
research involving genetic analyses or 
mental health research, that may alter 
an individual’s willingness to 
participate in the research. We request 
comment on each of these options, 
including their impact on the conduct of 
research and patient understanding of 
authorizations. 
We note that any modification in this 
area would not alter an individual’s 
right to revoke the authorization for the 
use or disclosure of protected health 
information for future research at any 
time and that the authorization would 
have to include a description of how the 
individual may do so. We request 
comment on how a revocation would 
operate with respect to future 
downstream research studies. 
The Department does not propose any 
specific modifications to the Privacy 
Rule at this time but requests public 
comment on the options identified 
above, as well as any others, for 
purposes of addressing this issue at the 
time the final rule is issued, if 
appropriate. In addition, any change in 
interpretation will be closely 
coordinated with the HHS Office for 
Human Research Protections (OHRP) 
and the FDA to ensure the Privacy Rule 
policies are appropriately harmonized 
with those under the HHS human 
subjects protections regulations (45 CFR 
part 46) and FDA human subjects 
protections regulations governing 
informed consent for research (21 CFR 
part 50). 
E. Protected Health Information About 
Decedents 
1. Section 164.502(f)—Period of 
Protection for Decedent Information 
Section 164.502(f) requires covered 
entities to protect the privacy of a 
decedent’s protected health information 
generally in the same manner and to the 
same extent that is required for the 
protected health information of living 
individuals. Thus, if an authorization is 
required for the use or disclosure of 
protected health information, a covered 
entity may use or disclose a decedent’s 
protected health information in that 
situation only if the covered entity 
obtains an authorization from the 
decedent’s personal representative. The 
personal representative for a decedent is 
the executor, administrator, or other 
person who has authority under 
applicable law to act on behalf of the 
decedent or the decedent’s estate. The 
Department has heard a number of 
concerns since the publication of the 
Privacy Rule that it can be difficult to 
locate a personal representative to 
authorize the use or disclosure of the 
decedent’s protected health information, 
particularly after an estate is closed. 
Furthermore, archivists, biographers 
and historians have expressed 
frustration regarding the lack of access 
to ancient or old records of historical 
value held by covered entities, even 
when there are likely few remaining 
individuals concerned with the privacy 
of such information. Archives and 
libraries may hold medical records that 
are centuries old. Furthermore, 
fragments of health information may be 
found throughout all types of archival 
holdings, such as correspondence files, 
diaries, and photograph collections, that 
are also in some cases centuries old. 
Currently, to the extent such 
information is maintained by a covered 
entity, it is subject to the Privacy Rule. 
For example, currently the Privacy Rule 
would apply in the same manner to the 
casebook of a 19th century physician as 
it would to the medical records of 
current patients of a physician. 
Accordingly, we propose to amend 
§ 164.502(f) to require a covered entity 
to comply with the requirements of the 
Privacy Rule with regard to the 
protected health information of a 
deceased individual for a period of 50 
years following the date of death. We 
also propose to modify the definition of 
‘‘protected health information’’ at 
§ 160.103 to make clear that the 
individually identifiable health 
information of a person who has been 
deceased for more than 50 years is not 
protected health information under the 
Privacy Rule. We believe that fifty years 
is an appropriate time span, because by 
approximately covering the span of two 
generations we believe it will both 
protect the privacy interests of most, if 
not all, living relatives, or other affected 
individuals, and it reflects the difficulty 
of obtaining authorizations from 
personal representatives as time passes. 
A fifty-year period of protection also 
was suggested at a prior National 
Committee for Vital and Health 
Statistics (NCVHS) (the public advisory 
committee which advises the Secretary 
on the implementation of the 
Administrative Simplification 
provisions of HIPAA, among other 
issues) meeting, at which committee 
members heard testimony from 
archivists regarding the problems 
associated with applying the Privacy 
Rule to very old records. See http:// 
ncvhs.hhs.gov/050111mn.htm. We 
request public comment on the 
appropriateness of this time period. 
We note that these proposed 
modifications would have no impact on 
a covered entity’s permitted disclosures 
related to decedents for law 
enforcement purposes (§ 164.512(f)(4)), 
to coroners or medical examiners and 
funeral directors (§ 164.512(g)), for 
research that is solely on the protected 
health information of decedents 
(§ 164.512(i)(1)(iii)), and for organ 
procurement organizations or other 
entities engaged in the procurement, 
banking, or transplantation of cadaveric 
organs, eyes, or tissue for the purpose of 
facilitating organ, eye or tissue donation 
and transplantation (§ 164.512(h)).

These disclosures are governed by other 
provisions of the Privacy Rule. 
2. Section 164.510(b)—Disclosures 
About a Decedent to Family Members 
and Others Involved in Care 
Section 164.510(b) describes how a 
covered entity may use or disclose 
protected health information to persons, 
such as family members or others, who 
are involved in an individual’s care or 
payment related to the individual’s 
health care. We have received a number 
of questions about the scope of the 
section, specifically with regard to the 
protected health information of 
decedents. We have heard concerns that 
family members, relatives, and others, 
many of whom may have had access to 
the health information of the deceased 
individual prior to death, have had 
difficulty obtaining access to such 
information after the death of the 
individual, because many do not qualify 
as a ‘‘personal representative’’ under 
§ 164.502(g)(4). 
As such, we propose to amend 
§ 164.510(b) to add a new paragraph (5), 
which would permit covered entities to 
disclose a decedent’s information to 
family members and others who were 
involved in the care or payment for care 
of the decedent prior to death, unless 
doing so is inconsistent with any prior 
expressed preference of the individual 
that is known to the covered entity. We 
propose to add conforming cross- 
references to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) 
and (b)(4). We note that this disclosure 
would be permitted, but would not be 
required. We request comment on any 
unintended consequences that this 
permissive disclosure provision might 
cause. 
We also note that these modifications 
do not change the authority of a 
decedent’s personal representative with 
regard to the decedent’s protected 
health information. Thus, a personal 
representative may continue to request 
access to or an accounting of a 
decedent’s protected health information, 
and may continue to authorize uses and 
disclosures of the decedent’s protected 
health information that are not 
otherwise permitted or required by the 
Privacy Rule. 
F. Section 164.512(b)—Disclosure of 
Student Immunizations to Schools 
The Privacy Rule, in § 164.512(b), 
recognizes that covered entities must 
balance protecting the privacy of health 
information with sharing health 
information with those responsible for 
ensuring public health and safety, and 
permits covered entities to disclose the 
minimum necessary protected health 
information to public health authorities 
or other designated persons or entities 
without an authorization for public 
health purposes specified by the Rule. 
Covered entities may disclose protected 
health information: (1) To a public 
health authority that is legally 
authorized to collect or receive the 
information for the purpose of 
preventing or controlling disease, 
injury, or disability (such as reporting 
communicable diseases, births, and 
deaths, or conducting public health 
interventions, investigations, and 
surveillance); (2) to a public health 
authority or other appropriate 
government authority to report child 
abuse if the authority is legally 
authorized to receive such reports; (3) to 
a person or entity subject to the 
jurisdiction of the FDA about the 
quality, safety, or effectiveness of an 
FDA-regulated product or activity for 
which the person or entity has 
responsibility (such as reporting adverse 
drug events to the drug manufacturer); 
(4) to notify a person that (s)he is at risk 
of contracting or spreading a disease or 
condition, as authorized by law, to carry 
out a public health intervention or 
investigation; and (5) to an employer 
under limited circumstances and 
conditions when the employer needs 
the information to comply with 
Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) or Mine Safety 
and Health Administration (MSHA) 
requirements. Any other disclosures 
that do not conform to these provisions, 
and that are not otherwise permitted by 
the Rule, require the individual’s prior 
written authorization. 
Schools play an important role in 
preventing the spread of communicable 
diseases among students by ensuring 
that students entering classes have been 
immunized. Most States have ‘‘school 
entry laws’’ which prohibit a child from 
attending school unless the school has 
proof that the child has been 
appropriately immunized. Typically, 
schools ensure compliance with those 
requirements by requesting the 
immunization records from parents 
(rather than directly from a health care 
provider), particularly because the 
Privacy Rule generally requires written 
authorization by the child’s parent 
before a covered health care provider 
may disclose protected health 
information directly to the school. Some 
States allow a child to enter school 
provisionally for a period of 30 days 
while the school waits for the necessary 
immunization information. 
We have heard concerns that the 
Privacy Rule may make it more difficult 
for parents to provide, and for schools 
to obtain, the necessary immunization 
documentation for students, which may 
prevent students’ admittance to school. 
The NCVHS submitted these concerns 
to the HHS Secretary and recommended 
that HHS regard disclosure of 
immunization records to schools to be a 
public health disclosure. See http:// 
www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/040617l2.htm. 
As such, we propose to amend 
§ 164.512(b)(1) by adding a new 
paragraph that permits covered entities 
to disclose proof of immunization to 
schools in States that have school entry 
or similar laws. While written 
authorization that complies with 
§ 164.508 would no longer be required 
for disclosure of such information, the 
covered entity would still be required to 
obtain agreement, which may be oral, 
from a parent, guardian or other person 
acting in loco parentis for the 
individual, or from the individual him- 
or herself, if the individual is an adult 
or emancipated minor. Because the 
proposed provision would permit a 
provider to accept a parent’s oral 
agreement to disclose immunization 
results to a school—as opposed to a 
written agreement—there is a potential 
for a miscommunication and later 
objection by the parent. We, therefore, 
request comment on whether the 
Privacy Rule should require that a 
provider document any oral agreement 
under this provision to help avoid such 
problems, or whether a requirement for 
written documentation would be overly 
cumbersome, on balance. We also 
request comment on whether the rule 
should mandate that the disclosures go 
to a particular school official and if so, 
who that should be. 
In addition, the Privacy Rule does not 
currently define the term ‘‘school’’ and 
we understand that the types of schools 
subject to the school entry laws may 
vary by State. For example, depending 
on the State, such laws may apply to 
public and private elementary or 
primary schools and secondary schools 
(kindergarten through 12th grade), as 
well as daycare and preschool facilities, 
and post-secondary institutions. Thus, 
we request comment on the scope of the 
term ‘‘school’’ for the purposes of this 
section and whether we should include 
a specific definition of ‘‘school’’ within 
the regulation itself. In addition, we 
request comment on the extent to which 
schools that may not be subject to these 
school entry laws but that may also 
require proof of immunization have 
experienced problems that would 
warrant their being included in this 
category of public health disclosures. 
Finally, we note that once a student’s 
immunization records are obtained and 
maintained by an educational 
institution or agency to which the

for, protected health information to ‘‘the 
minimum necessary to accomplish the 
intended purpose of the use, disclosure, 
or request.’’ Section 164.502(b)(2) 
outlines situations in which the 
minimum necessary rule does not 
apply. With respect to uses of protected 
health information, § 164.514(d)(2) 
requires covered entities to identify 
workforce members who need access to 
protected health information, to identify 
the categories and conditions of such 
access, and to make reasonable efforts to 
limit access consistent with such 
policies. With respect to disclosures of, 
and requests for, protected health 
information, § 164.514(d)(3) and (4) 
require that covered entities adopt 
policies and procedures addressing 
minimum necessary, including with 
regard to uses and disclosures that occur 
routinely. 
Section 13405(b)(1)(A) of the HITECH 
Act provides that a covered entity shall 
be treated as being in compliance with 
the minimum necessary requirements 
with respect to the use or disclosure of 
or the request for protected health 
information ‘‘only if the covered entity 
limits such protected health 
information, to the extent practicable, to 
the limited data set (as defined in 
section 164.514(e)(2) of such title) or, if 
needed by such entity, to the minimum 
necessary.’’ Section 13405(b)(1)(B) 
requires the Secretary to issue guidance 
on what constitutes ‘‘minimum 
necessary’’ within 18 months after the 
date of enactment. This guidance must 
take into account the guidance required 
by section 13424(c), relating to the de- 
identification of protected health 
information, as well as ‘‘the information 
necessary to improve patient outcomes 
and to detect, prevent, and manage 
chronic disease.’’ Section 13405(b)(1)(C) 
provides that the provisions of 
paragraph (A) no longer apply as of the 
effective date of the guidance issued 
under paragraph (B). 
Section 13405(b)(2) provides that, 
with respect to disclosures of protected 
health information, the covered entity or 
business associate making the 
disclosure shall determine what 
constitutes the minimum necessary. 
Section 13405(b)(3) provides that 
section 13405(b)(1) does not affect the 
application of the exceptions to the 
minimum necessary requirement, while 
section 13405(b)(4) provides that 
nothing in subsection (b) is to be 
construed as affecting the use or 
disclosure of or request for de-identified 
health information. 
Section 13405(b)(1)(A) requires that 
covered entities consider the feasibility 
of utilizing the limited data set in 
complying with the minimum necessary 
requirements of the Privacy Rule. 
However, that provision also permits a 
covered entity to employ its traditional 
minimum necessary policies and 
procedures if it decides that the limited 
data set will not meet the needs of the 
particular use, disclosure, or request in 
question. The requirement of this 
section, moreover, is an interim one; 
under section 13405(b)(1)(C), issuance 
of the guidance required by section 
13405(b)(1)(B) effectively sunsets the 
requirement of section 13405(b)(1)(A). 
For purposes of the required 
guidance, we take this opportunity to 
solicit public comment on what aspects 
of the minimum necessary standard 
covered entities and business associates 
believe would be most helpful to have 
the Department address in the guidance 
and the types of questions entities may 
have about how to appropriately 
determine the minimum necessary for 
purposes of complying with the Privacy 
Rule. We propose to leave the current 
regulatory text unchanged in this 
rulemaking as the issuance of the 
required guidance will obviate the need 
to make any regulatory modifications in 
this area. 
H. Section 164.514(f)—Fundraising 
Section 164.514(f)(1) of the Privacy 
Rule permits a covered entity to use, or 
disclose to a business associate or an 
institutionally related foundation, the 
following protected health information 
for its own fundraising purposes 
without an individual’s authorization: 
(1) Demographic information relating to 
an individual; and (2) the dates of 
health care provided to an individual. 
Section 164.514(f)(2) of the Privacy Rule 
requires a covered entity that plans to 
use or disclose protected health 
information for fundraising under this 
paragraph to inform individuals in its 
notice of privacy practices that it may 
contact them to raise funds for the 
covered entity. In addition, 
§ 164.514(f)(2) requires that a covered 
entity include in any fundraising 
materials it sends to an individual a 
description of how the individual may 
opt out of receiving future fundraising 
communications and that a covered 
entity must make reasonable efforts to 
ensure that individuals who do opt out 
are not sent future fundraising 
communications. 
Section 13406(b) of the HITECH Act, 
which became effective on February 18, 
2010, requires the Secretary to provide 
by rule that a covered entity provide the 
recipient of any fundraising 
communication with a clear and 
conspicuous opportunity to opt out of 
receiving any further fundraising 
communications. Additionally, section 
13406(b) states that if an individual 
does opt out of receiving further 
fundraising communications, the 
individual’s choice to opt out must be 
treated as a revocation of authorization 
under § 164.508 of the Privacy Rule. 
We propose a number of changes to 
the Privacy Rule’s fundraising 
requirements to implement these 
statutory provisions. First, we propose 
to strengthen the opt out by requiring 
that a covered entity provide, with each 
fundraising communication sent to an 
individual under these provisions, a 
clear and conspicuous opportunity for 
the individual to elect not to receive 
further fundraising communications. To 
satisfy this requirement, we also 
propose to require that the method for 
an individual to elect not to receive 
further fundraising communications 
may not cause the individual to incur an 
undue burden or more than nominal 
cost. We encourage covered entities to 
consider the use of a toll-free phone 
number, an e-mail address, or similar 
opt out mechanism that would provide 
individuals with a simple, quick, and 
inexpensive way to opt out of receiving 
future communications. We note that 
we would consider requiring 
individuals to write and send a letter to 
the covered entity asking not to receive 
future fundraising communications to 
constitute an undue burden on the 
individual for purposes of this proposed 
requirement. 
We also propose to provide that a 
covered entity may not condition 
treatment or payment on an individual’s 
choice with respect to receiving 
fundraising communications. We 
believe this modification would 
implement the language in section 
13406(b) of the HITECH Act that 
provides that an election by an

40897 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
individual not to receive further 
fundraising communications shall be 
treated as a revocation of authorization 
under the Privacy Rule. The legislative 
history of the HITECH Act indicates that 
it was Congress’ intent with this 
language that the protections that apply 
under § 164.508 to an individual who 
has revoked an authorization similarly 
apply to an individual who has opted 
out of fundraising communications, 
‘‘including the right not to be denied 
treatment as a result of making that 
choice.’’ See H.R. Conf. Rep. 111–16, p. 
498. Therefore, we make clear in this 
proposed rule that a covered entity 
would not be permitted to condition 
treatment or payment for care on an 
individual’s choice of whether to 
receive fundraising communications. 
Further, we propose to provide that a 
covered entity may not send fundraising 
communications to an individual who 
has elected not to receive such 
communications. This proposed 
language would strengthen the current 
requirement at § 164.514(f)(2)(iii) that a 
covered entity make ‘‘reasonable efforts’’ 
to ensure that those individuals who 
have opted out of receiving fundraising 
communications are not sent such 
communications. We have proposed 
stronger language to make clear the 
expectation that covered entities abide 
by an individual’s decision not to 
receive fundraising communications, as 
well as to make the fundraising opt out 
operate more like a revocation of 
authorization, consistent with the 
statutory language and legislative 
history of section 13406(b) of the 
HITECH Act discussed above. 
With respect to the operation of the 
opt out, we request comment regarding 
to what fundraising communications the 
opt out should apply. For example, if an 
individual receives a fundraising letter 
and opts out of receiving future 
fundraising communications, should the 
opt out apply to all future fundraising 
communications or should and can the 
opt out be structured in a way to only 
apply to the particular fundraising 
campaign described in the letter? In 
addition, given that we would require 
the opt out method to be simple and 
quick for the individual to exercise, 
such as the use of a phone number or 
e-mail address, we request comment on 
whether the Rule should allow a similar 
method, short of the individual signing 
an authorization, by which an 
individual who has previously opted 
out can put his or her name back on an 
institution’s fundraising list. 
We propose to retain the requirement 
that a covered entity that intends to 
contact the individual to raise funds 
under these provisions must include a 
statement to that effect in its notice of 
privacy practices. However, we do 
propose to modify the required 
statement slightly, as indicated below in 
the discussion of the notice 
requirements at § 164.520, by requiring 
that the notice also inform individuals 
that they have a right to opt out of 
receiving such communications. We 
also propose to move all of the 
fundraising requirements described 
above to § 164.514(f)(1), given that the 
proposed provisions for subsidized 
treatment communications discussed 
above now would be located at 
§ 164.514(f)(2). 
In addition to the above modifications 
proposed in response to the HITECH 
Act, we also solicit public comment on 
the requirement at § 164.514(f)(1) which 
limits the information a covered entity 
may use or disclose for fundraising 
demographic information about and 
dates of health care service provided to 
an individual. Since the promulgation 
of the Privacy Rule, certain covered 
entities have raised concerns regarding 
this limitation, maintaining that the 
Privacy Rule’s prohibition on the use or 
disclosure of certain treatment 
information without an authorization, 
such as the department of service where 
care was received and outcomes 
information, harms their ability to raise 
funds from often willing and grateful 
patients. In particular, covered entities 
have argued that the restrictions in the 
Privacy Rule prevent them from 
targeting their fundraising efforts and 
avoiding inappropriate solicitations to 
individuals who may have had a bad 
treatment outcome, and obtaining an 
individual’s authorization for 
fundraising as the individual enters or 
leaves the hospital for treatment is often 
impracticable or inappropriate. NCVHS 
also held a hearing and heard public 
testimony on this issue in July 2004. 
After considering the testimony 
provided, the NCVHS recommended to 
the Secretary that the Privacy Rule 
should allow covered entities to use or 
disclose information related to the 
patient’s department of service (broad 
designations, such as surgery or 
oncology, but not narrower designations 
or information relating to diagnosis or 
treating physician) for fundraising 
activities without patient authorization. 
NCVHS also recommended that a 
covered entity’s notice of privacy 
practices inform patients that their 
department of service information may 
be used in fundraising, and that patients 
should be afforded the opportunity to 
opt out of the use of their department 
of service information for fundraising or 
all fundraising contacts altogether. See 
http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/ 
040902lt1.htm. 
In light of these concerns and the 
prior recommendation of the NCVHS, 
the Department takes this opportunity to 
solicit public comment on whether and 
how the current restriction on what 
information may be used and disclosed 
should be modified to allow covered 
entities to more effectively target 
fundraising and avoid inappropriate 
solicitations to individuals, as well as to 
reduce the need to send solicitations to 
all patients. In particular, we solicit 
comment on: (1) Whether the Privacy 
Rule should allow additional categories 
of protected health information to be 
used or disclosed for fundraising, such 
as department of service or similar 
information, and if so, what those 
categories should be; (2) the adequacy of 
the minimum necessary standard to 
appropriately limit the amount of 
protected health information that may 
be used or disclosed for fundraising 
purposes; or (3) whether the current 
limitation should remain unchanged. 
We also solicit comment on whether, if 
additional information is permitted to 
be used or disclosed for fundraising 
absent an authorization, covered entities 
should be required to provide 
individuals with an opportunity to opt 
out of receiving any fundraising 
communications before making the first 
fundraising solicitation, in addition to 
the opportunity to opt out with every 
subsequent communication. We invite 
public comment on whether such a pre- 
solicitation opt out would be workable 
for covered entities and individuals and 
what mechanisms could be put into 
place to implement the requirement. 
I. Section 164.520—Notice of Privacy 
Practices for Protected Health 
Information 
Section 164.520 of the Privacy Rule 
sets out the requirements for most 
covered entities to have and to 
distribute a notice of privacy practices 
(NPP). The NPP must describe the uses 
and disclosures of protected health 
information a covered entity is 
permitted to make, the covered entity’s 
legal duties and privacy practices with 
respect to protect protected health 
information, and the individual’s rights 
concerning protected health 
information. 
With regard to the description of 
permitted uses and disclosures, 
§ 164.520(b)(1)(ii) requires a covered 
entity to include separate statements 
about the uses and disclosures that the 
covered entity intends to make for 
certain treatment, payment, or health 
care operations activities. Further, 
§ 164.520(b)(1)(ii)(E) currently requires

40898 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
that the NPP contain a statement that 
any uses and disclosures other than 
those permitted by the Privacy Rule will 
be made only with the written 
authorization of the individual, and that 
the individual has the right to revoke an 
authorization pursuant to 
§ 164.508(b)(5). The purpose of this 
statement is to put individuals on notice 
that covered entities may make certain 
uses and disclosures only with an 
authorization from the individual. 
Section 164.520(b)(1)(iv) requires that 
the NPP contain statements regarding 
the rights of individuals with respect to 
their protected health information and a 
brief description of how individuals 
may exercise such rights. Section 
164.520(b)(1)(iv)(A) currently requires a 
statement and a brief description 
addressing an individual’s right to 
request restrictions on the uses and 
disclosures of protected health 
information pursuant to § 164.522(a), 
including the fact that the covered 
entity is not required to agree to this 
request. 
We propose to amend 
§ 164.520(b)(1)(ii)(E) to require that the 
NPP include a statement that describes 
the uses and disclosures of protected 
health information that require an 
authorization under § 164.508(a)(2) 
through (a)(4), and to provide that other 
uses and disclosures not described in 
the notice will be made only with the 
individual’s authorization. The 
proposed provision would ensure that 
covered entities provide notice to 
individuals indicating that most 
disclosures of protected health 
information for which the covered 
entity receives remuneration would 
require the authorization of the 
individual. Such uses and disclosures 
may have previously been permitted 
under other provisions of the Rule but 
now require authorization, as discussed 
in connection with proposed 
§ 164.508(a)(4). 
We propose to require, in addition, 
that covered entities provide notice that 
most uses and disclosures of 
psychotherapy notes and for marketing 
purposes require an authorization so 
that individuals will be made aware of 
all situations in which authorization is 
required. We are concerned that 
omission of such a specific statement 
may be somewhat misleading or 
confusing, in that the NPP would state 
that the covered entity may use or 
disclose protected health information 
without authorization for purposes of 
treatment, payment, and health care 
operations and some individuals might 
assume that psychotherapy notes and 
marketing would be covered by these 
permissions. 
Section 164.520(b)(1)(iii) requires a 
covered entity to include in its NPP 
separate statements about certain 
activities if the covered entity intends to 
engage in any of the activities. In 
particular, § 164.520(b)(1)(iii) requires a 
separate statement in the notice if the 
covered entity intends to contact the 
individual to provide appointment 
reminders or information about 
treatment alternatives or other health- 
related benefits or services; to contact 
the individual to fundraise for the 
covered entity; or, with respect to a 
group health plan, to disclose protected 
health information to the plan sponsor. 
We propose the following changes to 
these provisions. First, we propose to 
modify § 164.520(b)(1)(iii)(A) to align 
the required statement with the 
proposed modifications related to 
marketing and subsidized treatment 
communications. A covered health care 
provider that intends to send treatment 
communications to the individual in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 164.514(f)(2) concerning treatment 
alternatives or other health-related 
products or services where the provider 
receives financial remuneration in 
exchange for making the 
communication would be required to 
inform the individual in advance in the 
NPP, as well as inform the individual 
that he or she has the opportunity to opt 
out of receiving such communications. 
Second, at § 164.520(b)(1)(iii)(B) we 
propose to require that if a covered 
entity intends to contact the individual 
to raise funds for the entity as permitted 
under § 164.514(f)(1), the covered entity 
must not only inform the individual in 
the NPP of this intention but also that 
the individual has the right to opt out 
of receiving such communications. 
We also propose to modify the 
requirement of § 164.520(b)(1)(iv)(A) 
which requires covered entities to notify 
individuals of the individuals’ right to 
request restrictions. This provision 
currently includes a requirement that 
the NPP state that the covered entity is 
not required to agree to such a request. 
Since this statement will no longer be 
accurate when the modifications to 
proposed § 164.522(a)(1)(vi) that are 
required by the HITECH Act are made 
(see discussion in the following 
section), proposed § 160.520(b)(1)(iv)(A) 
would require, in addition, that the 
statement include an exception for 
requests under § 164.522(a)(1)(vi). 
Under subpart D of part 164, covered 
entities now have new obligations to 
comply with the requirements for 
notification to affected individuals, the 
media, and the Secretary following a 
breach of unsecured protected health 
information. We request comment on 
whether the Privacy Rule should require 
a specific statement regarding this new 
legal duty and what particular aspects of 
this new duty would be important for 
individuals to be notified of in the NPP. 
The proposed modifications to 
§ 164.520 represent material changes to 
the NPP of covered entities. Section 
164.520(b)(3) requires that when there is 
a material change to the NPP, covered 
entities must promptly revise and 
distribute the NPP as outlined by 
§ 164.520(c). Section 164.520(c)(1)(i)(C) 
requires that health plans provide notice 
to individuals covered by the plan 
within 60 days of any material revision 
to the NPP. We recognize that revising 
and redistributing a NPP may be costly 
for health plans and request comment 
on ways to inform individuals of this 
change to privacy practices without 
unduly burdening health plans. In 
particular, we are considering a number 
of options in this area: (1) Replace the 
60-day requirement with a requirement 
for health plans to revise their NPPs and 
redistribute them (or at least notify 
members of the material change to the 
NPP and how to obtain the revised NPP) 
in their next annual mailing to members 
after a material revision to the NPP, 
such as at the beginning of the plan year 
or during the open enrollment period; 
(2) provide a specified delay or 
extension of the 60-day timeframe for 
health plans; (3) retain the provision 
generally to require health plans to 
provide notice within 60-days of a 
material revision but provide that the 
Secretary will waive the 60-day 
timeframe in cases where the timing or 
substance of modifications to the 
Privacy Rule call for such a waiver; or 
(4) make no change, and thus, require 
that health plans provide notice to 
individuals within 60 days of the 
material change to the NPP that would 
be required by this proposed rule. We 
request comment on these options, as 
well as on any other options for 
informing individuals in a timely 
manner of this proposed or other 
material changes to the NPP. 
Section 164.520(c)(2)(iv) requires that 
when a health care provider with a 
direct treatment relationship with an 
individual revises the NPP, the health 
care provider must make the NPP 
available upon request on or after the 
effective date of the revision and must 
comply with the requirements of 
§ 164.520(c)(2)(iii) to have the NPP 
available at the delivery site and to post 
the notice in a clear and prominent 
location. We do not believe these 
requirements will be overly burdensome 
on health care providers and do not 
propose changes to them, but we request 
comment on this issue.

40899 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
J. Section 164.522(a)—Right To Request 
Restriction of Uses and Disclosures 
Section 164.522(a) of the Privacy Rule 
requires covered entities to permit 
individuals to request that a covered 
entity restrict uses or disclosures of 
their protected health information for 
treatment, payment, and health care 
operations purposes, as well as for 
disclosures to family members and 
certain others permitted under 
§ 164.510(b). While covered entities are 
not required to agree to such requests 
for restrictions, if a covered entity does 
agree to restrict the use or disclosure of 
an individual’s protected health 
information, the covered entity must 
abide by that restriction, except in 
emergency circumstances when the 
information is required for the treatment 
of the individual. Section 164.522 also 
includes provisions for the termination 
of such a restriction and requires that 
covered entities that have agreed to a 
restriction document the restriction in 
writing. 
Section 13405(a) of the HITECH Act, 
which became effective February 18, 
2010, requires that when an individual 
requests a restriction on disclosure 
pursuant to § 164.522, the covered 
entity agree to the requested restriction 
unless otherwise required by law, if the 
request for restriction is on disclosures 
of protected health information to a 
health plan for the purpose of carrying 
out payment or health care operations 
and if the restriction applies to 
protected health information that 
pertains solely to a health care item or 
service for which the health care 
provider involved has been paid out of 
pocket in full. This statutory 
requirement overrides the provision in 
§ 164.522(a)(1)(ii) that the covered entity 
is not required to agree to requests for 
restrictions and requires that we modify 
the regulation. 
To implement section 13405(a), we 
propose to add a new § 164.522(a)(1)(vi) 
to describe the elements of the required 
restriction. We also propose to add 
conforming language to 
§ 164.522(a)(1)(ii) to reflect the 
mandatory nature of the restriction as 
required by the statute. Finally, we 
propose conforming modifications to 
§ 164.522(a)(2) and (3), which address 
terminating and documentation of 
restrictions. We discuss these 
modifications in more detail below. 
We propose to add a new paragraph 
(vi) to § 164.522(a)(1), which would 
require a covered entity, upon request 
from an individual, to agree to a 
restriction on the disclosure of protected 
health information to a health plan if: 
(A) the disclosure is for the purposes of 
carrying out payment or healthcare 
operations and is not otherwise required 
by law; and (B) the protected health 
information pertains solely to a health 
care item or service for which the 
individual, or person on behalf of the 
individual other than the health plan, 
has paid the covered entity in full. We 
also propose to modify the language in 
§ 164.522(a)(1)(ii), which states that a 
covered entity is not required to agree 
to a restriction, to refer to this exception 
to that general rule. We note that under 
the Privacy Rule, a covered entity may 
make a disclosure to a business 
associate of another covered entity only 
where the disclosure would be 
permitted directly to the other covered 
entity. Thus, in cases where an 
individual has exercised his or her right 
to have a restriction placed under this 
paragraph on a disclosure to a health 
plan, the covered entity is also 
prohibited from making such disclosure 
to a business associate of the health 
plan. 
Section 13405(a) makes clear that an 
individual has a right to have 
disclosures regarding certain health care 
items or services for which the 
individual pays out of pocket in full 
restricted from a health plan. We believe 
the Act provides the individual with the 
right to determine for which health care 
items or services the individual wishes 
to pay out of pocket and restrict. Thus, 
we do not believe a covered entity could 
require individuals who wish to restrict 
disclosures about only certain health 
care items or services to a health plan 
to restrict disclosures of protected 
health information regarding all health 
care to the health plan—i.e., to require 
an individual to have to pay out of 
pocket for all services to take advantage 
of this right regardless of the particular 
health care item or service about which 
the individual requested the restriction. 
We believe such a policy would be 
contrary to Congressional intent, in that 
it would discourage individuals from 
requesting restrictions in situations 
where Congress clearly intended they be 
able to do so. For example, an 
individual who regularly visits the same 
provider for the treatment of both 
asthma and diabetes must be able to 
request, and have the provider honor, a 
restriction on the disclosure of diabetes- 
related treatment to the health plan as 
long as the individual pays out of 
pocket for this care. The provider 
cannot require that the individual apply 
the restriction to all care given by the 
provider and, as a result, cannot require 
the individual to pay out of pocket for 
both the diabetes and asthma-related 
care in order to have the restriction on 
the diabetes care honored. We 
encourage covered entities to work with 
individuals who wish to restrict certain 
information from disclosure to health 
plans to determine the best method for 
ensuring that the appropriate 
information is restricted from disclosure 
to a health plan. 
Due to the myriad of treatment 
interactions between covered entities 
and individuals, we recognize that this 
provision may be more difficult to 
implement in some circumstances than 
in others, and we request comment on 
the types of interactions between 
individuals and covered entities that 
would make requesting or implementing 
a restriction more difficult. For example, 
an individual visits a provider for 
treatment of a condition, and the 
individual requests the provider not 
disclose information about the 
condition to the health plan and pays 
out of pocket for the care. The provider 
prescribes a medication to treat the 
condition, and the individual also 
wishes to restrict the health plan from 
receiving information about the 
medication. Many providers 
electronically send prescriptions to the 
pharmacy to be filled so that the 
medication is ready when the 
individual arrives to pick it up; 
however, at the point the individual 
arrives at the pharmacy, the pharmacy 
would have already sent the information 
to the health plan for payment, not 
permitting the individual an 
opportunity to request a restriction at 
the pharmacy. A provider who knows 
that an individual intends to request 
such a restriction can always provide 
the individual with a paper prescription 
to take to the pharmacy, allowing the 
individual an opportunity to request 
that the pharmacy restrict the disclosure 
of information relating to the 
medication. However, this might not be 
practical in every case, especially as 
covered entities begin to replace paper- 
based systems with electronic systems. 
We request comment on this issue, and 
we ask specifically for suggestions of 
methods through which a provider, 
using an automated electronic 
prescribing tool, could alert the 
pharmacy that the individual may wish 
to request that a restriction be placed on 
the disclosure of their information to the 
health plan and that the individual 
intends to pay out of pocket for the 
prescription. 
Additionally, we request comment on 
the obligation of covered health care 
providers that know of a restriction to 
inform other health care providers 
downstream of such restriction. For 
example, a provider has been treating an 
individual for an infection for several

months pursuant to the individual’s 
requested restriction that none of the 
protected health information relating to 
the treatment of the infection be 
disclosed to the individual’s health 
plan. If the individual requests that the 
provider send a copy of his medical 
records to another health care provider 
for treatment, what, if any, obligation 
should the original provider have to 
notify the recipient provider (including 
a pharmacy filling the individual’s 
prescription) that the individual has 
placed a restriction upon much of the 
protected health information in the 
medical record? We request comment 
on whether a restriction placed upon 
certain protected health information 
should apply to, and the feasibility of it 
continuing to attach to, such 
information as it moves downstream, or 
if the restriction should no longer apply 
until the individual visits the new 
provider for treatment or services, 
requests a restriction, and pays out of 
pocket for the treatment. In addition, we 
request comment on the extent to which 
technical capabilities exist that would 
facilitate notification among providers 
of restrictions on the disclosure of 
protected health information, how 
widely these technologies are currently 
utilized, and any limitations in the 
technology that would require 
additional manual or other procedures 
to provide notification of restrictions. 
In accordance with the HITECH Act, 
proposed § 164.522(a)(1)(vi)(A) would 
permit a covered entity to disclose 
protected health information to a health 
plan if such disclosure is required by 
law, despite an individual’s request for 
a restriction. We note that the term 
‘‘required by law’’ is defined at 
§ 164.103. We request comment on 
examples of types of disclosures that 
may fall under this provision. 
With respect to the proposed 
requirement in § 164.522(a)(1)(vi)(B) 
that the covered entity be paid in full for 
the health care item or service for which 
the individual requests a restriction, we 
have added some language to the 
statutory provision to ensure that this 
requirement not be limited to solely the 
individual as the person paying the 
covered entity for the individual’s care. 
There are many situations in which 
family members or other persons may 
pay for the individual’s treatment. Thus, 
this proposed paragraph would provide 
that as long as the covered entity is paid 
for the services by the individual or 
another person on behalf of the 
individual other than the health plan, 
the covered entity would be required to 
abide by the restriction. 
With regard to proposed 
§ 164.522(a)(1)(vi)(B), we emphasize 
that when an individual requests a 
restriction of information to a health 
plan and pays out of pocket for the 
treatment or service, the individual 
should not expect that this payment will 
count towards the individual’s out of 
pocket threshold with respect to his or 
her health plan benefits. As the very 
nature of this provision is to restrict 
information from flowing to the health 
plan, the health plan will be unaware of 
any payment for treatment or services 
for which the individual has requested 
a restriction, and thus, this out of pocket 
payment cannot be used to reach the 
threshold for benefits a health plan 
offers. 
We request public comment on how 
this provision will function with respect 
to HMOs. A provider who contracts 
with an HMO generally receives a fixed 
payment from an HMO based on the 
number of patients seen and not based 
on the treatment or service provided, 
and an individual patient of that 
provider pays a flat co-payment for 
every visit regardless of the treatment or 
service received. Therefore, it is our 
understanding that under most current 
HMO contracts with providers an 
individual could not pay the provider 
for the treatment or service received. 
Thus, individuals who belong to an 
HMO may have to use an out-of-network 
provider if they wish to ensure that 
certain protected health information is 
not disclosed to the HMO. We request 
public comment on this issue. 
Finally, with respect to proposed 
§ 164.522(a)(1)(vi)(B), we emphasize 
that if an individual’s out of pocket 
payment for a health care item or 
service to restrict disclosure of the 
information to a health plan is not 
honored (for example, the individual’s 
check bounces), the covered entity may 
then submit the information to the 
health plan for payment as the 
individual has not fulfilled the 
requirements necessary to obtain a 
restriction. We do not believe that the 
statutory intent was to permit 
individuals to avoid payment to 
providers for the health care services 
they provide. Therefore, if an individual 
does not pay in full for the treatment or 
services provided to the individual, 
then the provider is under no obligation 
to restrict the information and may 
disclose the protected health 
information to the health plan to receive 
payment. However, we expect covered 
entities to make some attempt to resolve 
the payment issue with the individual 
prior to sending the protected health 
information to the health plan, such as 
by notifying the individual that his or 
her payment did not go through and to 
give the individual an opportunity to 
submit payment. We request comment 
on the extent to which covered entities 
must make reasonable efforts to secure 
payment from the individual prior to 
submitting protected health information 
to the health plan for payment. 
We propose to modify § 164.522(a)(2) 
and (3) regarding terminating 
restrictions and documentation of 
restrictions to reflect the addition of 
these new requirements. First, we 
would modify the language in 
§ 164.522(a)(2) to remove the term ‘‘its 
agreement to’’ to clarify that the 
termination provisions apply to all 
restrictions, even those which are 
mandatory for the covered entity. 
Similarly, we would modify the 
language in § 164.522(a)(3) regarding 
documentation to remove the words 
‘‘that agrees to a restriction’’ to make 
clear that the documentation 
requirements apply to all restrictions, 
including those that would be required 
by proposed paragraph (a)(1)(vi). 
Additionally, we propose to modify 
§ 164.522(a)(2)(iii) to conform to 
proposed paragraph (a)(1)(vi), requiring 
the mandatory restrictions for certain 
disclosures to health plans. In 
particular, in cases in which a covered 
entity is required to agree to a restriction 
under this section, we propose to add a 
new paragraph (A) to paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) to clarify that a covered entity 
may not unilaterally terminate such a 
restriction. 
The proposed modifications would 
operate as follows with respect to 
termination of a restriction under 
proposed paragraph (a)(1)(vi). For 
example, an individual who has 
requested a restriction on the disclosure 
of protected health information to a 
health plan about a particular health 
care service visits the provider for 
follow-up treatment, asks the provider 
to bill the health plan for the follow-up 
visit, and does not request a restriction 
at the time, nor pays out of pocket for 
the follow-up treatment. In such 
circumstances, there is no restriction in 
effect with respect to the follow-up 
treatment. However, the provider may 
need to submit information about the 
original treatment to the health plan so 
that it can determine the medical 
appropriateness or medical necessity of 
the follow-up care provided to the 
individual. At this time, we would 
consider the lack of a restriction with 
respect to the follow-up treatment to 
extend to any protected health 
information necessary to effect payment 
for such treatment, even if such 
information pertained to prior treatment 
that was subject to a restriction. We 
encourage covered entities to have an 
open dialogue with individuals to

protected health information may be 
disclosed to the health plan unless they 
request an additional restriction and pay 
out of pocket for the follow-up care. We 
request public comment on this issue. 
K. Section 164.524—Access of 
Individuals to Protected Health 
Information 
Section 164.524 of the Privacy Rule 
currently establishes, with limited 
exceptions, an enforceable means by 
which individuals have a right to review 
or obtain copies of their protected 
health information, to the extent such 
information is maintained in the 
designated record set(s) of a covered 
entity. An individual’s right of access 
exists regardless of the format of the 
protected health information, and the 
standards and implementation 
specifications that address individuals’ 
requests for access and timely action by 
the covered entity (i.e., provision of 
access, denial of access, and 
documentation) apply to an electronic 
environment in a similar manner as they 
do to a paper-based environment. See 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule’s Right of 
Access and Health Information 
Technology (providing guidance with 
respect to how § 164.524 applies in an 
electronic environment and how health 
information technology can facilitate 
providing individuals with this 
important privacy right), available at: 
http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/ 
understanding/special/healthit/ 
eaccess.pdf. 
Section 13405(e) of the HITECH Act, 
which became effective February 18, 
2010, strengthens the Privacy Rule’s 
right of access with respect to covered 
entities that use or maintain an 
electronic health record on an 
individual. Section 13405(e) provides 
that when a covered entity uses or 
maintains an electronic health record 
with respect to protected health 
information of an individual, the 
individual shall have a right to obtain 
from the covered entity a copy of such 
information in an electronic format and 
the individual may direct the covered 
entity to transmit such copy directly to 
the individual’s designee, provided that 
any such choice is clear, conspicuous, 
and specific. Section 13405(e) also 
provides that any fee imposed by the 
covered entity for providing such an 
electronic copy shall not be greater than 
the entity’s labor costs in responding to 
the request for the copy. 
Section 13405(e) applies by its terms 
only to protected health information in 
electronic health records. However, 
incorporating these new provisions in 
such a limited manner in the Privacy 
Rule could result in a complex set of 
disparate requirements for access to 
protected health information in 
electronic health records systems versus 
other types of electronic records 
systems. As such, the Department 
proposes to use its authority under 
section 264(c) of HIPAA to prescribe the 
rights individuals should have with 
respect to their individually identifiable 
health information to strengthen the 
right of access as provided under 
section 13405(e) of the HITECH Act 
more uniformly to all protected health 
information maintained in one or more 
designated record sets electronically, 
regardless of whether the designated 
record set is an electronic health record. 
We discuss our proposed amendments 
to each provision implicated by section 
13405(e) more specifically below. 
Section 164.524(c)(2) of the Privacy 
Rule requires a covered entity to 
provide the individual with access to 
the protected health information in the 
form or format requested by the 
individual, if it is readily producible in 
such form or format, or, if not, in a 
readable hard copy form or such other 
form or format as agreed to by the 
covered entity and the individual. 
Section 13405(e) of the HITECH Act 
expands this requirement by explicitly 
requiring a covered entity that uses or 
maintains an electronic health record 
with respect to protected health 
information to provide the individual 
with a copy of such information in an 
electronic format. 
We propose to implement this 
statutory provision, in conjunction with 
our broader authority under section 
264(c) of HIPAA, by requiring, in 
proposed § 164.524(c)(2)(ii), that if the 
protected health information requested 
is maintained electronically in one or 
more designated record sets, the covered 
entity must provide the individual with 
access to the electronic information in 
the electronic form and format 
requested by the individual, if it is 
readily producible, or, if not, in a 
readable electronic form and format as 
agreed to by the covered entity and the 
individual. This provision would 
require any covered entity that 
electronically maintains the protected 
health information about an individual, 
in one or more designated record sets, 
to provide the individual with an 
electronic copy of such information (or 
summary or explanation if agreed to by 
the individual in accordance with 
proposed § 164.524(c)(2)(iii)) in the 
electronic form and format requested or 
in an otherwise agreed upon form and 
format. While an individual’s right of 
access to an electronic copy of protected 
health information is currently limited 
under the Privacy Rule by whether the 
form or format requested is readily 
producible, covered entities that 
maintain such information 
electronically in a designated record set 
would be required under these proposed 
modifications to provide some type of 
electronic copy, if requested by an 
individual. 
Because we do not want to bind 
covered entities to standards that may 
not yet be technologically mature, we 
propose to permit covered entities to 
make some other agreement with 
individuals as to an alternative means 
by which they may provide a readable 
electronic copy, to the extent the 
requested means is not readily 
producible. If, for example, a covered 
entity received a request to provide 
electronic access via a secure Web-based 
portal, but the only readily producible 
version of the protected health 
information was in portable document 
format (PDF), proposed 
§ 164.524(c)(2)(ii) would require the 
covered entity to provide the individual 
with a PDF copy of the protected health 
information, if agreed to by the covered 
entity and the individual. We note that 
while there may be circumstances 
where a covered entity determines that 
it can comply with the Privacy Rule’s 
right of access by providing individuals 
with limited access rights to their 
electronic health record, such as 
through a secure Web-based portal, 
nothing under the current Rule or 
proposed modifications would require a 
covered entity to do so where the 
covered entity determines it is not 
reasonable or appropriate. 
We note that the option of arriving at 
an alternative agreement that satisfies 
both parties is already part of the 
requirement to provide access under 
§ 164.524(c)(2)(i), so extension of such a 
requirement to electronic access should 
present few implementation difficulties. 
Further, as with other disclosures of 
protected health information, in 
providing the individual with an 
electronic copy of protected health 
information through a Web-based portal, 
e-mail, on portable electronic media, or 
other means, covered entities should 
ensure that reasonable safeguards are in 
place to protect the information. We 
also note that the proposed modification 
presumes that covered entities have the 
capability of providing an electronic 
copy of protected health information 
maintained in their designated record 
set(s) electronically through a secure 
Web-based portal, via e-mail, on 
portable electronic media, or other 
manner. We invite public comment on 
this presumption.

40902 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
Section 164.524(c)(3) of the Privacy 
Rule currently requires the covered 
entity to provide the access requested by 
the individual in a timely manner, 
which includes arranging with the 
individual for a convenient time and 
place to inspect or obtain a copy of the 
protected health information, or mailing 
the copy of protected health information 
at the individual’s request. The 
Department has previously interpreted 
this provision as requiring a covered 
entity to mail the copy of protected 
health information to an alternative 
address requested by the individual, 
provided the request was clearly made 
by the individual and not a third party. 
Section 13405(e)(1) of the HITECH Act 
provides that if the individual chooses, 
he or she shall have a right to direct the 
covered entity to transmit an electronic 
copy of protected health information in 
an electronic health record directly to 
an entity or person designated by the 
individual, provided that such choice is 
clear, conspicuous, and specific. 
Based on section 13405(e)(1) of the 
HITECH Act and our authority under 
section 264(c) of HIPAA, we propose to 
expand § 164.524(c)(3) to expressly 
provide that, if requested by an 
individual, a covered entity must 
transmit the copy of protected health 
information directly to another person 
designated by the individual. This 
proposed amendment is consistent with 
the Department’s prior interpretation on 
this issue and would apply without 
regard to whether the protected health 
information is in electronic or paper 
form. We propose to implement the 
requirement of section 13405(e)(1) that 
the individual’s ‘‘choice [be] clear, 
conspicuous, and specific’’ by requiring 
that the individual’s request be ‘‘in 
writing, signed by the individual, and 
clearly identify the designated person 
and where to send the copy of protected 
health information.’’ We note that the 
Privacy Rule allows for electronic 
documents to qualify as written 
documents for purposes of meeting the 
Rule’s requirements, as well as 
electronic signatures to satisfy any 
requirements for a signature, to the 
extent the signature is valid under 
applicable law. Thus, a covered entity 
could employ an electronic process for 
receiving an individual’s request to 
transmit a copy of protected health 
information to his or her designee under 
this proposed provision. Whether the 
process is electronic or paper-based, a 
covered entity must implement 
reasonable policies and procedures 
under § 164.514(h) to verify the identity 
of any person who requests protected 
health information, as well as 
implement reasonable safeguards under 
§ 164.530(c) to protect the information 
that is used or disclosed. 
Section 164.524(c)(4) of the Privacy 
Rule currently permits a covered entity 
to impose a reasonable, cost-based fee 
for a copy of protected health 
information (or a summary or 
explanation of such information). 
However, such a fee may only include 
the cost of: (1) The supplies for, and 
labor of, copying the protected health 
information; (2) the postage associated 
with mailing the protected health 
information, if applicable; and (3) the 
preparation of an explanation or 
summary of the protected health 
information, if agreed to by the 
individual. With respect to providing a 
copy (or summary or explanation) of 
protected health information from an 
electronic health record in electronic 
form, however, section 13405(e)(2) of 
the HITECH Act provides that a covered 
entity may not charge more than its 
labor costs in responding to the request 
for the copy. 
In response to section 13405(e)(2) of 
the HITECH Act, we propose to amend 
§ 164.524(c)(4)(i) to identify separately 
the labor for copying protected health 
information, whether in paper or 
electronic form, as one factor that may 
be included in a reasonable cost-based 
fee. While we do not propose more 
detailed considerations for this factor 
within the regulatory text, we retain all 
prior interpretations of labor with 
respect to paper copies—that is, that the 
labor cost of copying may not include 
the costs associated with searching for 
and retrieving the requested 
information. With respect to electronic 
copies, we believe that a reasonable 
cost-based fee includes costs 
attributable to the labor involved to 
review the access request and to 
produce the electronic copy, which we 
expect would be negligible. However, 
we would not consider a reasonable 
cost-based fee to include a standard 
‘‘retrieval fee’’ that does not reflect the 
actual labor costs associated with the 
retrieval of the electronic information or 
that reflects charges that are unrelated to 
the individual’s request (e.g., the 
additional labor resulting from technical 
problems or a workforce member’s lack 
of adequate training). We invite public 
comment on this aspect of our 
rulemaking, specifically with respect to 
what types of activities related to 
managing electronic access requests 
should be compensable aspects of labor. 
We also propose to amend 
§ 164.524(c)(4)(ii) to provide separately 
for the cost of supplies for creating the 
paper copy or electronic media (i.e., 
physical media such as a compact disc 
(CD) or universal serial bus (USB) flash 
drive), if the individual requests that the 
electronic copy be provided on portable 
media. This reorganization and the 
addition of the phrase ‘‘electronic 
media’’ reflects our understanding that 
since section 13405(e)(2) of the HITECH 
Act permits only the inclusion of labor 
costs in the charge for electronic copies, 
it by implication excludes charging for 
the supplies that are used to create an 
electronic copy of the individual’s 
protected health information, such as 
the hardware (computers, scanners, etc.) 
or software that is used to generate an 
electronic copy of an individual’s 
protected health information in 
response to an access request. We note 
this limitation is in contrast to a covered 
entity’s ability to charge for supplies for 
hard copies of protected health 
information (e.g., the cost of paper, the 
prorated cost of toner and wear and tear 
on the printer). See 65 FR 82462, 82735, 
Dec. 28, 2000 (responding to a comment 
seeking clarification on ‘‘capital cost for 
copying’’ and other supply costs by 
indicating that a covered entity was free 
to recoup all of their reasonable costs for 
copying). We believe this interpretation 
is consistent with the fact that, unlike a 
hard copy, which generally exists on 
paper, an electronic copy exists 
independent of media, and can be 
transmitted securely via multiple 
methods (e.g., e-mail, a secure Web- 
based portal, or an individual’s own 
electronic media) without accruing any 
ancillary supply costs. 
We also note, however, that our 
interpretation of the statute would 
permit a covered entity to charge a 
reasonable and cost-based fee for any 
electronic media it provided, as 
requested or agreed to by an individual 
who does not provide their own. For 
example, a covered entity can offer to 
make protected health information 
available on an encrypted USB flash 
drive, and can charge a reasonable cost- 
based fee for the flash drive. If, however, 
an individual has brought his or her 
own electronic media (such as a 
recordable CD), requested that an 
electronic copy be placed on it, and the 
covered entity’s systems are readily able 
to do so, then the covered entity would 
not be allowed to require the individual 
to purchase an encrypted USB flash 
drive instead. Likewise, if an individual 
requests that an electronic copy be sent 
via unencrypted e-mail, the covered 
entity should advise the individual of 
the risks associated with unencrypted e- 
mail, but the covered entity would not 
be allowed to require the individual to 
instead purchase a USB flash drive. 
While we propose to renumber the 
remaining factors in § 164.524(c)(4), we

40903 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
do not propose to amend their 
substance. With respect to 
§ 164.524(c)(4)(iii), however, we note 
that our interpretation of the statute 
would permit a covered entity to charge 
for postage if an individual requests that 
the covered entity transmit portable 
media containing an electronic copy 
through mail or courier (e.g., if the 
individual requests that the covered 
entity save protected health information 
to a CD and then mail the CD to a 
designee). 
Finally, we are requesting comment 
on one aspect of the right to access and 
obtain a copy of protected health 
information which the HITECH Act did 
not amend. In particular, the HITECH 
Act did not change the timeliness 
requirements for provision of access in 
§ 164.524(b). Under the current 
requirements, a request for access must 
be approved or denied, and if approved, 
access or a copy of the information 
provided, within 30 days of the request. 
In cases where the records requested are 
only accessible from an off-site location, 
the covered entity has an additional 30 
days to respond to the request. In 
extenuating circumstances where access 
cannot be provided within these 
timeframes, the covered entity may have 
a one-time 30-day extension if the 
individual is notified of the need for the 
extension within the original 
timeframes. 
With regard to the timeliness of the 
provision of access, we are aware that 
with the advance of electronic health 
records, there is an increasing 
expectation and capacity to provide 
individuals with almost instantaneous 
electronic access to the protected health 
information in those records through 
personal health records or similar 
electronic means. On the other hand, we 
are not proposing to limit the right to 
electronic access of protected health 
information to certified electronic 
health records, and the variety of 
electronic systems that are subject to 
this proposed requirement would not all 
be able to comply with a timeliness 
standard based on personal health 
record capabilities. It is our assumption 
that a single timeliness standard that 
would address a variety of electronic 
systems, rather than having a multitude 
of standards based on system capacity, 
would be the preferred approach to 
avoid workability issues for covered 
entities. Even under a single standard, 
nothing would prevent electronic health 
record systems from being developed 
through the HITECH Act’s standards 
and certification process with the 
technological capabilities to exceed the 
Privacy Rule’s timeliness requirements 
for providing access to individuals. 
Based on the assumption that a single 
standard would be the preferred 
approach, we are interested in public 
comment on an appropriate, common 
timeliness standard for the provision of 
access by covered entities with 
electronic designated record sets 
generally. We would appreciate 
comment on aspects of existing systems 
that would create efficiencies in 
processing of requests for electronic 
information, as well as those aspects of 
electronic systems that would provide 
little change from the time required for 
processing a paper record. Alternatively, 
we request comment on whether the 
current standard could be altered for all 
systems, paper and electronic, such that 
all requests for access should be 
responded to without unreasonable 
delay and not later than 30 days. 
We are also interested in public 
comment on whether, contrary to our 
assumption, a variety of timeliness 
standards based on the type of 
electronic designated record set is the 
preferred approach and if so, how we 
should operationalize such an approach. 
For example, how should we identify 
and characterize the various electronic 
designated record sets to which the 
different standards would apply, such 
as personal health records, electronic 
health records, and others? What 
functionality within these electronic 
systems would drive the need for more 
or less time to provide an individual 
with electronic access? What timeliness 
standards would be appropriate for the 
different systems? What timeliness 
standard(s) would be required of entities 
with protected health information 
spread across hybrid systems that have 
different functionalities? What would be 
the impact of and challenges to having 
multiple timeliness standards for 
access? 
Finally, we request comment on the 
time necessary for covered entities to 
review access requests and make 
necessary determinations, such as 
whether the granting of access would 
endanger the individual or other 
persons so as to better understand how 
the time needed for these reviews 
relates to the overall time needed to 
provide the individual with access. 
Further, we request comment generally 
on whether the provision which allows 
a covered entity an additional 30 days 
to provide access to the individual if the 
protected health information is 
maintained off-site should be eliminated 
altogether for both paper and electronic 
records, or at least for protected health 
information maintained or archived 
electronically because the physical 
location of electronic data storage is not 
relevant to its accessibility. 
L. Other Technical and Conforming 
Changes 
We propose to make a number of 
technical and conforming changes to the 
Privacy Rule to fix minor problems such 
as incorrect cross-references, mistakes of 
grammar, and typographical errors. 
Technical and conforming changes of 
this nature are described and explained 
in the table below. 
Regulation § Current language Proposed change Reason for change 
164.510(b)(2)(iii) ................. ‘‘based the exercise of professional 
judgment’’.

3056’’ and the ‘‘to’’ before ‘‘for’’.
Correct typographical errors. 
In addition to the technical changes 
listed in the table above, we propose to 
make a few changes that are technical or 
conforming in nature, but for which the 
reason for the change is more 
programmatic in nature. These are as 
follows:

40904 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
Section 164.506(c)(5) permits a 
covered entity to disclose protected 
health information ‘‘to another covered 
entity that participates in the organized 
health care arrangement.’’ We propose to 
change the words ‘‘another covered 
entity that participates’’ to ‘‘other 
participants’’ because not all 
participants in an organized health care 
arrangement may be covered entities; for 
example, some physicians with staff 
privileges at a hospital may not be 
covered entities. 
Section 164.510(a)(1)(ii) permits the 
disclosure of directory information to 
members of the clergy and other persons 
who ask for the individual by name. We 
propose to add the words ‘‘use or’’ to this 
permission, to cover the provision of 
such information to clergy who are part 
of a facility’s workforce. 
Section 164.510(b)(3) covers uses and 
disclosures of protected health 
information when the individual is not 
present to agree or object to the use or 
disclosure, and, as pertinent here, 
permits disclosure to persons only of 
‘‘the protected health information that is 
directly relevant to the person’s 
involvement with the individual’s 
health care.’’ We propose to delete the 
last two quoted words and substitute 
therefore the following: ‘‘care or 
payment related to the individual’s 
health care or needed for notification 
purposes.’’ This change would align the 
text of paragraph (b)(3) with the 
permissions provided for at paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. 
Where an employer needs protected 
health information to comply with 
workplace medical surveillance laws, 
such as OSHA or MSHA, 
§ 164.512(b)(1)(v)(A) permits a covered 
entity to disclose, subject to certain 
conditions, protected health information 
of an individual to the individual’s 
employer if the covered entity is a 
covered health care provider ‘‘who is a 
member of the workforce of such 
employer or who provides health care to 
the individual at the request of the 
employer.’’ We propose to amend the 
quoted language by removing the words 
‘‘who is a member of the workforce of 
such employer or’’, as the language is 
unnecessary. 
In § 164.512(k)(1)(ii), we propose to 
replace the word ‘‘Transportation’’ with 
‘‘Homeland Security.’’ The language 
regarding a component of the 
Department of Transportation was 
included to refer to the Coast Guard; 
however, the Coast Guard was 
transferred to the Department of 
Homeland Security in 2003. In addition, 
at § 164.512(k)(5)(i)(E), we propose to 
replace the word ‘‘and’’ after the semi- 
colon with the word ‘‘or.’’ The intent of 
§ 164.512(k)(5)(i) is not that the 
existence of all of the conditions is 
necessary to permit the disclosure, but 
rather that the existence of any would 
permit the disclosure. 
VII. Regulatory Analyses 
A. Introduction 
We have prepared a regulatory impact 
statement in compliance with Executive 
Order 12866 (September 1993, 
Regulatory Planning and Review), the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96–354), 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 (Pub. L. 104–4), and Executive 
Order 13132 on Federalism. 
1. Executive Order 12866 
Executive Order 12866 directs 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity). A regulatory impact 
analysis must be prepared for major 
rules that have economically significant 
effects ($100 million or more in any one 
year) or adversely affect in a material 
way the economy, a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or Tribal 
government or communities (58 FR 
51741). 
We estimate that the effects of the 
requirement for covered entities 
(including indirect costs incurred by 
third party administrators, which 
frequently send out notices on behalf of 
health plans) to issue new notices of 
privacy practices, will result in new 
costs of $166.1 million within 12 
months of the effective date of the final 
rule. We estimate that the private sector 
will bear approximately 71 percent of 
the costs, with State and Federal plans 
bearing the remaining 29 percent of the 
costs. As a result of the economic 
impact, and other costs that are 
expected but not quantified in the 
regulatory analysis below, we 
determined that this proposed rule is an 
economically significant regulatory 
action within the meaning of section 
3(f)(4) of Executive Order 12866. We 
present our analysis of the costs of the 
proposed rule in section C below. 
2. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses if a rule has a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. We present our regulatory 
flexibility analysis of this proposed rule 
in section E below. 
The Act generally defines a ‘‘small 
entity’’ as (1) a proprietary firm meeting 
the size standards of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), (2) a nonprofit 
organization that is not dominant in its 
field, or (3) a small government 
jurisdiction with a population of less 
than 50,000. Because 90 percent or more 
of all health care providers meet the 
SBA size standard for a small business 
or are nonprofit organizations, we 
generally treat all health care providers 
as small entities for purposes of 
performing a regulatory flexibility 
analysis. The SBA size standard for 
health care providers ranges between 
$7.0 million and $34.5 million in 
annual receipts. 
With respect to health insurers and 
third party administrators, the SBA size 
standard is $7.0 million in annual 
receipts. While some insurers are 
classified as nonprofit, it is possible 
they are dominant in their market. For 
example, a number of Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield insurers are organized as 
nonprofit entities; yet they dominate the 
health insurance market in the States 
where they are licensed. In addition, we 
lack the detailed information on annual 
receipts for insurers and plan 
administrators and, therefore, we do not 
know how many firms qualify as small 
entities. We welcome comments on the 
number of small entities in the health 
insurer and health plan administrator 
market. 
3. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule whose mandates would require 
spending in any one year $100 million 
in 1995 dollars, updated annually for 
inflation. In 2010, that threshold is 
approximately $135 million. UMRA 
does not address the total cost of a rule. 
Rather, it focuses on certain categories 
of cost, mainly those ‘‘Federal mandate’’ 
costs resulting from: (1) Imposing 
enforceable duties on State, local, or 
Tribal governments, or on the private 
sector; or (2) increasing the stringency of 
conditions in, or decreasing the funding 
of, State, local, or Tribal governments 
under entitlement programs. 
We are able to identify approximately 
$166.1 million in costs on both the 
private sector and State and Federal 
health plans. There may be other costs 
we are not able to monetize because we 
lack data, and the proposed rule may 
produce savings that may offset some or 
all of the added costs. For this purpose, 
we must also separately identify costs to

40905 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
5 http://www.bls.gov/oes/2008/may/ 
oes231011.htm for lawyers. 
6 We identified 701,325 entities that must prepare 
and deliver NPPs that are shown in Table 1 below. 
This includes 696,758 HIPAA covered entities that 
are health care providers, including hospitals, 
nursing facilities, doctor offices, outpatient care 
centers, medical diagnostic, imaging service, home 
health service and other ambulatory care service 
covered entities, medical equipment suppliers, and 
pharmacies. For the purposes of our calculation, we 
have rounded this number to 697,000. Table 1 also 
includes 4,567 health insurance carriers and third 
party administrators working on behalf of covered 
health plans. The cost estimates for these entities 
are addressed later. 
be incurred by the private sector and 
those incurred by State and Federal 
entities. 
As noted above, of the costs we can 
identify, we estimate that approximately 
71 percent or $118.1 million of new 
costs will fall on the private sector. For 
the purpose of this calculation, we 
included all $46 million in provider 
costs as private sector costs. While we 
recognize that some providers are State 
or Federal entities, we do not have 
adequate information to estimate the 
number of public providers, but we 
believe the number to be significantly 
less than 10% of all providers shown in 
Table 1. Therefore, as we did for the 
RFA analysis and for ease of calculation, 
we assumed that all provider costs are 
private sector costs. We welcome 
comment on this assumption and any 
information regarding the number of the 
public sector providers for future 
analysis. With regard to identifying the 
costs to private sector health plans, 
based on the data discussed in section 
C below, we estimate that 60 percent of 
policy holders are served by private 
sector health plans and, therefore, have 
allocated 60 percent of the costs to be 
incurred by all health plans as private 
sector costs, or $72.1 million. 
Similarly, we estimate that 
approximately 29 percent or $48 million 
of the new costs will fall on State and 
Federal plans. As noted above, based on 
the data discussed in section C below, 
we estimate that 40 percent of policy 
holders are served by public sector 
plans and, therefore, have allocated 40 
percent of the costs for all health plans 
as public sector costs, or $48 million. 
Because the amount of unfunded 
mandates incurred separately by either 
the private sector or by State, local, and 
Tribal governments will not exceed the 
unfunded mandates threshold of $133 
million, we are not required to perform 
a cost-benefit analysis under the UMRA. 
Nonetheless, we have prepared a cost- 
benefit analysis of the proposed rule in 
sections C and D, below, as required by 
Executive Order 12866 for an 
economically significant regulation. We 
welcome public comment on the 
analysis as it bears upon our 
assumptions and calculations under the 
UMRA. 
4. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
The Federalism implications of the 
Privacy and Security Rules were 
assessed as required by Executive Order 
13132 and published as part of the 
preambles to the final rules on 
December 28, 2000 (65 FR 82462, 
82797) and February 20, 2003 (68 FR 
8334, 8373), respectively. Regarding 
preemption, the preamble to the final 
Privacy Rule explains that the HIPAA 
statute dictates the relationship between 
State law and Privacy Rule 
requirements, and the Rule’s 
preemption provisions do not raise 
Federalism issues. The HITECH Act, at 
section 13421(a), provides that the 
HIPAA preemption provisions shall 
apply to the HITECH provisions and 
requirements. While we have made 
minor technical changes to the 
preemption provisions in Subpart B of 
Part 160 to conform to and incorporate 
the HITECH Act preemption provisions, 
these changes do not raise new 
Federalism issues. The proposed 
changes include: (1) Amending the 
definitions of ‘‘contrary’’ and ‘‘more 
stringent’’ to reference business 
associates; and (2) further amending the 
definition of contrary to provide that 
State law would be contrary to the 
HIPAA Administrative Simplification 
provisions if it stands as an obstacle to 
the accomplishment and execution of 
the full purposes and objectives of not 
only HIPAA, but also the HITECH Act. 
We do not believe that this rule will 
impose substantial direct compliance 
costs on State and local governments 
that are not required by statute. It is our 
understanding that State and local 
government covered entities do not 
engage in marketing, the sale of 
protected health information, or 
fundraising. Therefore, the proposed 
modifications in these areas would not 
cause additional costs to State and local 
governments. We anticipate that the 
most significant direct costs on State 
and local governments will be the cost 
for State and local government-owned 
covered entities of drafting, printing, 
and distributing revised notices of 
privacy practices, which would include 
the cost of mailing these notices for 
State health plans, such as Medicaid. 
However, the costs involved can be 
attributed to the statutory requirements. 
In considering the principles in and 
requirements of Executive Order 13132, 
the Department has determined that 
these proposed modifications to the 
Privacy and Security Rules will not 
significantly affect the rights, roles, and 
responsibilities of the States. 
B. Why is This Rule Needed? 
The proposed rule is needed to 
implement several provisions of the 
HITECH Act that require us to amend 
our regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 
164. These amendments primarily 
strengthen the privacy and security 
protections for protected health 
information, as well as broaden the 
privacy rights of individuals. 
C. Costs 
1. Notifying Individuals of Their New 
Privacy Rights 
Covered entities must provide 
individuals with NPPs that detail how 
the covered entity may use and disclose 
protected health information and 
individuals’ rights with respect to their 
own health information. Due to the 
proposed modifications pursuant to the 
HITECH Act, covered entities must 
modify their NPPs and distribute them 
to affected individuals to advise them of 
the following strengthened privacy 
protections: (1) The addition of the sale 
of protected health information as a use 
or disclosure that requires the express 
written authorization of the individual; 
(2) a separate statement that provides 
advance notice to the individual if the 
healthcare provider receives financial 
remuneration from a third party to send 
treatment communications to the 
individual about that party’s products or 
services, and the right of the individual 
to elect not to receive such 
communications; and (3) the right of the 
individual to restrict disclosures of 
protected health information to a health 
plan with respect to treatment services 
for which the individual has paid out of 
pocket in full. 
For providers, the cost of developing 
a new NPP consists of drafting and 
printing the notice. The costs of 
distribution are minimal because 
providers will hand out the NPPs when 
patients come for their appointments. 
We estimate that drafting the updated 
NPPs will require approximately one- 
third of an hour of professional, legal 
time at approximately $90 per hour—or 
$30—that includes hourly wages of $60 
plus 50 percent 5. The total cost for 
attorneys for the approximately 
697,000 6 health care providers in the

U.S. is, therefore, expected to be 
approximately $21 million. Printing the 
NPPs will require paper and clerical 
time at a cost of $0.10 per notice. We 
estimate that within 12 months from the 
effective date of the final rule, providers 
will print approximately 250 million 
NPPs to hand to patients who visit their 
offices. Printing costs for 250 million 
NPPs will be $25 million. The total cost 
for providers is approximately $46 
million. 
For health plans, the cost of 
developing a new NPP consists of 
drafting, printing and mailing the 
notice. With the exception of a few large 
health plans, most health plans do not 
self-administer their plans. The majority 
of plans are either health insurance 
issuers (approximately 1,000) or utilize 
third party administrators that act on 
their behalf in the capacity as business 
associates. We identified approximately 
3,500 third party administrators acting 
as business associates for approximately 
446,400 ERISA plans identified by the 
Department of Labor. In addition, the 
Department of Labor identified 20,300 
public non-Federal health plans that 
may use third party administrators. 
Almost all of the public and ERISA 
plans, we believe, employ third party 
administrators to administer their health 
plans. While the third party 
administrators will bear the direct costs 
of issuing the revised NPPs, the costs 
will generally be passed on to the plans 
that contract with them. Those plans 
that self-administer their own plans will 
also incur the costs of issuing the 
revised NPPs. We do not know how 
many plans administer as well as 
sponsor health plans and invite 
comments on the number of self- 
administered plans; however, unless 
there were many such plans it would 
not have much effect on these estimates. 
For the approximately 4,500 health 
insurance issuers and health plan 
administrators, the cost of composing 
and printing the NPPs will be a similar 
amount per NPP to the amount 
calculated for providers. However, 
health insurers and plan administrators 
will have to mail the NPPs to policy 
holders. The costs for the mailing will 
consist of postage and clerical time. The 
cost, therefore, depends on the estimate 
of the number of policy holders who 
must receive NPPs. We did not assume 
that health plans would communicate 
with policy holders by e-mail because 
we have no data that indicate the extent 
to which insurance plans and third 
party administrators communicate 
currently with their policy holders 
through e-mail. We request public 
comment on this assumption. 
Because the Privacy Rule requires that 
only the named insured or policy holder 
be notified of changes to the health 
plans’ privacy practices even if that 
policy also covers dependents, we 
expect that only policy holders will 
receive the revised NPPs mandated by 
this rule. For public programs such as 
Medicare, where each individual is a 
policy holder, Medicare has a policy of 
mailing one notice or a set of program 
materials to a household of four or fewer 
beneficiaries at the same address. 
Although there are 45.6 million 
individual Medicare beneficiaries, the 
program only sends out 38.8 million 
pieces of mail per mailing. 
Actuarial Research Corporation 
(ARC), our consultant, estimated the 
number of policy holders for all classes 
of insurance products to be 
approximately 183.6 million, including 
all public programs. The data comes 
from the Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey from 2004–2006 projected to 
2010. ARC estimated 112.6 million 
private sector policy holders and 71.0 
million public ‘‘policy holders.’’ The 
total, including more recent Medicare 
data, is 188.3 million persons (which 
results in roughly a split of 60 percent 
private policy holders and 40 percent 
public ‘‘policy holders’’), whom we 
expect to receive NPPs from their plans. 
The estimates do not capture policy 
holders who are in hospitals or nursing 
homes at the time of the survey, or 
individuals who may have been insured 
under more than one plan in a year, for 
example, because their job status 
changed, they have supplemental 
policies, or they have more than one 
employer, creating duplicate coverage. 
Therefore, ARC recommended we use 
200 million for the number of NPPs that 
will actually be sent. 
The costs of drafting, printing, and 
distributing the NPP are estimated to be 
the following. First, drafting the NPP is 
estimated to require one-third hour of 
legal services at a cost of $30 × 4,500 
insurance plans and insurance 
administrative entities, which equals 
$135,000. Second, the cost of printing 
the NPP, which includes the cost of 
paper and actual printing, is estimated 
to be $0.10 per notice × 200 million 
notices, which equals $20 million. 
Third, the cost of distributing the NPPs 
would involve clerical time to prepare 
the mailings and the cost of postage, 
which we estimate to be a unit cost of 
$0.50 per NPP for postage and handling 
using the rate of $0.44 per stamp and 
$0.06 for labor (the same rates we used 
in the Breach Notification for Unsecured 
Protected Health Information 
Regulations published in the Federal 
Register at 74 FR 42763), results in an 
estimated $100 million cost for 
distribution. The total cost for all plans 
for drafting, printing, and distributing 
the NPP therefore, is approximately 
$120.1 million. We note that this total 
may be an overestimation of the costs 
because many insurers may use bulk 
mailing rates to distribute their NPPs 
which would reduce their mailing costs. 
The total estimated cost for both 
providers and health plans to notify 
individuals and policy holders of 
changes in their privacy rights is 
approximately $166.1 million in the 
first year following implementation of 
the rule. Annualized over 10 years at 
three percent and seven percent, the 
cost equals $194,720 and $236,489, 
respectively. 
Table 1 below shows the number of 
covered entities by class of provider and

2. Authorization and Other 
Requirements for Disclosures Related to 
Marketing and Sale of Protected Health 
Information 
The proposed rule would make 
modifications to the definition of 
‘‘marketing,’’ such that some 
communications to individuals about 
health-related products or services that 
are made under health care operations 
would now be considered marketing 
communications if the covered entity 
receives financial remuneration by a 
third party to make the communication. 
For marketing communications, 
individual authorization is required. In 
addition, the proposal would require 
that a health care provider that receives 
financial remuneration by a third party 
in exchange for sending a treatment 
communication to an individual about 
the third party’s product or service must 
disclose the fact of remuneration in the 
communication and provide the 
individual with a clear and conspicuous 
opportunity to opt out of receiving 
future subsidized communications. 
Although this proposed rule would 
modify the current definition of 
‘‘marketing,’’ because we do not have 
information on the extent to which 
covered entities currently receive 
financial remuneration from third 
parties in exchange for sending 
information to individuals about the 
third parties’ health-related products or 
services, we do not know how these 
modifications would change how 
covered entities operate. We invite 
public comment on this issue. 
In addition, the proposed rule would 
require an individual authorization 
before a covered entity could disclose 
protected health information in 
exchange for remuneration (i.e., ‘‘sell’’ 
protected health information). The 
proposal includes several exceptions to 
this authorization requirement. On its 
face, this proposed modification would 
appear to increase the burden to covered 
entities by requiring them to obtain 
authorizations in situations in which no 
authorization is currently required. 
However, we believe such a scenario is 
unlikely to occur. Even if covered 
entities attempted to obtain 
authorizations in compliance with the 
proposed modifications, we believe 
most individuals would not authorize 
these types of disclosures. It would not 
be worthwhile for covered entities to 
continue to attempt to obtain such 
authorizations, and as a result, we 
believe covered entities would simply 
discontinue making such disclosures. 
Therefore, we believe this proposed 
modification would have little to no 
impact on covered entities. We request 
comment on this issue. 
The proposed provision requiring 
individual authorization prior to the 
sale of protected health information 
contains several exceptions in which 
protected health information could be 
disclosed in exchange for remuneration 
without first obtaining individual 
authorization. Most of the excepted 
disclosures would not impose 
additional requirements and, therefore, 
would not impose any additional 
burden on covered entities to 
implement. However, the exception for 
research disclosures may impose an 
additional burden on researchers. The 
exception applies to disclosure of 
protected health information for 
research as long as the remuneration 
received does not exceed the cost to 
produce and transmit the information. 
Researchers who purchase data from 
covered entities may now incur 
additional costs as a result of the 
proposed rule, in order to obtain newly 
required authorizations, if they are 
currently paying a covered entity more 
than the cost to produce and transmit 
the protected health information (unless 
the covered entity is willing to reduce 
its charges for the data). The proposed 
change would classify such transactions 
as a sale, and as such would require an 
individual’s authorization prior to the 
covered entity’s disclosure. This 
authorization requirement also may 
have additional effects on research, such 
that the need for authorization may 
skew the sample, or if the researcher 
does not have the resources to obtain 
the authorizations from the research 
subjects, the research may be 
jeopardized. Since we have no 
information on the amounts currently 
paid to covered entities by researchers 
for protected health information, we 
have no way to estimate the impact of 
the provision. We welcome any 
comments and information on the 
impact of these provisions. 
3. Authorization for Compound 
Disclosures 
The proposed rule would permit 
compound authorizations for research 
purposes as long as it is clear to 
individuals that they do not have to 
agree to both the conditioned and 
unconditioned components of an 
authorization in order to receive 
research-related treatment. We believe 
that the proposed provision would 
reduce burden on the research 
community by eliminating the need for 
multiple forms for research studies 
involving both a clinical trial and a 
related research repository or study. 
However we have no data which would 
permit us to estimate the amount of 
burden reduction associated with this 
proposal. We welcome public comment 
on this issue. 
4. Uses and Disclosures of Decedents’ 
Protected Health Information 
The proposed rule would modify the 
current rule to limit the period for 
which a covered entity must protect an 
individual’s health information to 50 
years after the individual’s death. We 
believe this will reduce the burden on 
both covered entities and on those 
seeking the protected health information 
of persons who have been deceased for 
many years by eliminating the need to 
search for and find a personal 
representative of the decedent, who in 
many cases may not be known or even 
exist after so many years, to authorize 
the disclosure. We believe this change 
would benefit family members and 
historians who may seek access to the 
medical information of these decedents 
for personal and public interest reasons. 
However, we lack any data to be able to 
estimate the benefits or costs of this

40908 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
provision. We welcome comments on 
this proposed change. 
5. Uses and Disclosures for Care and 
Notification Purposes 
The proposed rule would permit 
covered entities to disclose a decedent’s 
protected health information to family 
members, or other persons involved in 
the individual’s care or payment for care 
before the individual’s death, unless 
doing so would be inconsistent with any 
prior expressed preference of the 
individual that is known to the covered 
entity. The rights of the decedent’s 
personal representative to have access to 
the protected health information of the 
decedent would remain unchanged. We 
believe the proposed change would 
reduce burden by permitting covered 
entities to continue to disclose protected 
health information to family members 
and other persons who were involved in 
an individual’s care while the 
individual was alive after the death of 
the individual without needing to 
obtain authorization from the decedent’s 
personal representative, who may not be 
known or even exist. However, we have 
no data to permit us to estimate the 
reduction in burden and we welcome 
comment on this change. 
6. Public Health Disclosures 
The proposed rule would create a new 
public health provision to permit 
disclosure of proof of a child’s 
immunization by a covered entity to a 
school in States that have school entry 
or similar laws. This proposed change 
would allow a covered health care 
provider to release proof of 
immunization to a school without 
having to obtain a written authorization, 
provided the provider obtained the 
agreement (oral or otherwise) to the 
disclosure from either the parent or 
guardian, or the individual, if the 
individual is an adult or emancipated 
minor. We expect the proposed change 
to the regulations may reduce the 
burden on covered entities and parents 
in obtaining and providing written 
authorizations but it is unclear by how 
much. Since the proposed rule would 
require the covered entity and the 
responsible party for the student to 
agree that the covered entity may release 
proof of immunization, some covered 
entities may request the agreement in 
writing. In these cases, there may be 
little change from the current 
authorization requirement in terms of 
the burden. Because we lack data on the 
burden reduction, we cannot provide an 
estimate of the possible savings. We 
welcome comment on the proposed 
change. 
7. Fundraising Requirements 
The proposed rule would require that 
any fundraising communication sent to 
an individual must provide the 
recipient with a clear and conspicuous 
opportunity to opt out of receiving any 
further fundraising communications. If 
an individual elects to opt out, the 
fundraising entity must not send that 
individual additional fundraising 
communications. We believe that the 
strengthened language from the HITECH 
Act that requires fundraisers to clearly 
and conspicuously provide the recipient 
an opt-out choice from receiving future 
communication and to treat such a 
choice as a revocation of authorization 
will result in fewer unwanted 
fundraising communications. However, 
we lack the data to estimate the effects 
of this change. We request comment on 
the extent to which the requirement that 
the opportunity to elect not to receive 
further fundraising communications be 
clear and conspicuous would have an 
impact on covered entities and their 
current fundraising materials. 
8. Individuals’ Access to Protected 
Health Information 
Under the proposed regulations, if a 
covered entity maintains protected 
health information electronically and 
the recipient requests copies of his or 
her protected health information in an 
electronic format, the covered entity or 
business associate must provide the 
information in the electronic format 
requested by the individual if readily 
producible in that format, or, if not, in 
a different electronic format agreed to by 
the covered entity and the individual. If 
the covered entity provides an 
individual with electronic access to 
protected health information, the 
proposed rule would only allow the 
covered entity to charge the costs of 
labor associated with the preparation of 
the request. The proposed rule clarifies 
the labor and supply costs applicable to 
preparation of electronic requests vs. 
paper requests. Labor costs to produce 
an electronic copy involve the cost of 
reviewing and preparing the copy. 
Supplies for an electronic copy apply 
only to the cost of the media, if 
applicable, for providing the 
information to the individual. If the 
individual provides the media (e.g., a 
CD or flash drive), there would be no 
cost for the media. Similarly, if the 
information is transmitted via e-mail or 
some other electronic mode, there 
would be no charge for media. 
It is unclear whether there will be any 
cost increase or decrease to either the 
individual or the covered entity with 
respect to the individual’s increased 
access to their electronic protected 
health information. The fact that the 
proposed rule requires the covered 
entity to provide information in an 
electronic format may be, in practice, no 
different than the current requirement to 
provide protected health information to 
the individual in electronic format, if 
readily producible in such format. Both 
the current and proposed rules continue 
to permit the covered entity and 
individual to negotiate over the format 
and delivery of protected health 
information. By emphasizing the 
provision of protected health 
information electronically, the proposed 
rule may lower costs because postage 
costs are eliminated or reduced and 
labor and supply costs are significantly 
reduced. In conclusion, there may be 
some savings that result from the greater 
use of electronic access to protected 
health information, but we cannot 
quantify them. 
9. Business Associates and Covered 
Entities and Their Contractual 
Relationships 
The proposed rule would extend 
liability for failure to comply with the 
Privacy and Security Rules directly to 
business associates and business 
associate subcontractors in a manner 
similar to how they now apply to 
covered entities. The proposed rule 
would subject business associates to 
many of the same standards and 
implementation specifications, and to 
the same penalties, that apply to 
covered entities under the Security Rule 
and to some of the same standards and 
implementation specifications, and to 
the same penalties, that apply to 
covered entities under the Privacy Rule. 
Additionally, business associates would 
also be required to obtain satisfactory 
assurances in the form of a business 
associate agreement from subcontractors 
that the subcontractors will safeguard 
any protected health information in 
their possession. If the business 
associate learns of a pattern of activity 
or practice of a subcontractor that 
constitutes a material breach or 
violation of the contract, the business 
associate would be required to make 
reasonable attempts to repair the breach 
or correct the violation. If unsuccessful, 
the business associate would be 
required to terminate the contract, if 
feasible. In addition, a business 
associate would be required to furnish 
any information the Secretary requires 
to investigate whether the business 
associate is in compliance with the 
regulations. 
In the absence of reliable data to the 
contrary, we assume that business 
associates’ compliance with their 
VerDate Mar<15>2010 15:51 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\14JYP2.SGM 14JYP2sro

40909 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 134 / Wednesday, July 14, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
contracts range from the minimal 
compliance to avoid contract 
termination to being fully compliant. 
The burden of the proposed rules on 
business associates depends on the 
terms of the contract between the 
covered entity and business associate, 
and the degree to which a business 
associate established privacy policies 
and adopted security measures that 
comport with the HIPAA Rules. For 
business associates that have already 
taken HIPAA-compliant measures to 
protect the privacy and security of the 
protected health information in their 
possession, the proposed rules with 
their increased penalties would impose 
limited burden. 
We assume that business associates in 
compliance with their contracts would 
have already designated personnel to be 
responsible for formulating the 
organization’s privacy and security 
policies, performed a risk analysis, and 
invested in hardware and software to 
prevent and monitor for internal and 
external breaches of protected health 
information. We expect that most 
business associates make a good-faith 
effort to follow the terms of their 
contracts and comply with current 
security and privacy standards. 
For those business associates that 
have not already adopted HIPAA- 
compliant privacy and security 
standards for protected health 
information, the risk of criminal and/or 
civil monetary penalties may spur them 
to increase their efforts to comply with 
the privacy and security standards. Up 
to this point, the consequences of failing 
to meet the privacy and security 
standards were limited to a business 
loss in the form of a terminated contract. 
In the context of the business associate’s 
overall business, the risk of losing the 
contract may not be a sufficient 
incentive to warrant investing in added 
security or establishing privacy policies 
potentially at significant expense. There 
may be other more benign reasons such 
as ignorance of potential threats or lack 
of knowledgeable personnel on staff. 
Regardless of the reason, to avoid the 
risk of the far more serious penalties in 
this proposed rule, we expect that 
business associates and subcontractors 
that have been lax in their complying 
with the privacy and security standards 
may now take steps to enhance their 
security procedures and strengthen their 
policies for protecting the privacy of the 
protected health information under their 
control. 
As stated above, we have no 
information on the degree of contract 
enforcement and compliance among 
business associates. We also lack 
information regarding the size or type of 
business associates that contract with 
covered entities. We have only rough 
estimates as to the overall number of 
business associates, which ranges from 
approximately one million to two 
million depending upon the number of 
business associates which serve 
multiple covered entities. As the area of 
health information technology expands, 
we note that the proposed rule also 
includes in the definition of business 
associates entities such as e-prescribing 
gateways, health information 
organizations or other organizations that 
provide data transmission services with 
respect to protected health information 
to a covered entity. 
As a result of the lack of information, 
we can only assume that some business 
associates and subcontractors comply 
with existing privacy and security 
standards. For them, the proposed rules 
would impose only a limited burden. 
For business associates that do not have 
HIPAA-compliant privacy policies and 
security procedures, the proposed rules 
imposing criminal and civil monetary 
penalties directly on business associates 
and their subcontractors may 
incentivize these organizations to 
bolster their security and privacy 
policies. Depending on the current level 
of compliance, for some business 
associates, the proposed rule could 
impose significant burdens. We 
welcome comments on our analysis and 
especially invite information regarding 
the amount of burden and the number 
of affected business associates. 
The cost to renegotiate contracts 
between covered entities and business 
associates and between business 
associates and subcontractors may be 
minimal if we assume that all parties are 
living up to their current contractual 
agreements. At the same time, we 
anticipate that an unknown number of 
contracts will have to be modified to 
reflect the changes in law and in the 
rules we propose. The time involved in 
modifying a contract is estimated to be 
one hour of a legal professional’s time. 
Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
reports, the average hourly wage of $60 
plus an estimated additional 50 percent 
for benefits brings the hourly rate to 
$90. 
Because we are allowing contracts to 
be phased in over one year from the 
compliance date or 18 months from the 
effective date of the final rule, we expect 
that the costs of modifying contracts 
will be incorporated into the normal 
renegotiation of contracts as the 
contracts expire. We believe that most 
contracts will be renegotiated over the 
phase-in period. In addition, the 
Department expects to issue revised 
sample business associate contract 
language when these rules are finalized, 
which may help to lessen the costs 
associated with contract modifications. 
Under these assumptions, the costs will 
be minimal. We request comments on 
the number of contracts and covered 
entities that will not be able to complete 
renegotiation of their contracts with 
their business associates within 18 
months. 
Even with the phase-in period for 
renegotiating contracts, we expect there 
will be an unknown number of covered 
entities and business associates that will 
have to renegotiate their contracts before 
the term of their current contracts expire 
because: (1) some contracts may extend 
beyond the eighteen month period, (2) 
fear of incurring civil or criminal 
penalties may motivate the parties to 
ensure they are in compliance with the 
new rules, and (3) the covered entity 
and business associate may have 
established only the minimum 
requirements and seek to strengthen 
their compliance under the new rules. 
As stated previously, we are unsure 
which of these scenarios applies. We 
welcome comments on the extent of cost 
to renegotiate contracts. 
D. Benefits 
The proposed modifications pursuant 
to the HITECH Act would provide 
benefits to individuals. The benefits for 
individuals include added information 
on their rights through an expanded 
NPP and greater control over the uses 
and disclosures of their personal health 
information by expanding the 
requirements to obtain authorization 
before a covered entity or business 
associate can disclose their protected 
health information in exchange for 
remuneration and to restrict certain 
disclosures at the request of the 
individual. Under the proposed rule, 
individuals would also have easier 
access to their protected health 
information in an electronic format, and 
relatives and friends of deceased 
persons would be able to obtain the 
person’s protected health information 
when there is no personal representative 
or without obtaining authorization 
under some circumstances. In addition, 
covered entities would only need to 
protect the health information of 
decedents for 50 years after their death, 
as opposed to protecting the information 
in perpetuity as is required by the 
current rule. This would also mean that 
the personal health information of 
persons who had been deceased for 
many years would be available to 
historians, researchers, and family 
members. Also, individuals’ rights with 
respect to fundraising communications 
would be strengthened. In States that

require immunization information for 
school attendance, schools would have 
an easier time obtaining immunization 
records because the proposed rule 
would eliminate the need for written 
authorization. 
Under the proposed rule, pursuant to 
the HITECH Act, an individual’s health 
information will be afforded greater 
protection since business associates of 
covered entities would share 
responsibility with the covered entity 
for safeguarding against impermissible 
disclosures of protected health 
information. Business associates and 
subcontractors would be subject to 
criminal and civil penalties for violating 
the privacy and security of protected 
health information entrusted to them. 
While we are certain that the 
proposed regulatory changes represent 
distinct benefits, we cannot monetize 
their value. We have no measure for 
valuing the benefit an individual would 
gain from the authorization requirement 
when a covered entity or business 
associate exchanges protected health 
information for remuneration. Neither 
do we know how much value would be 
added when an individual receives their 
protected health information in an 
electronic format nor the amount of time 
saved as a result of the public health 
disclosure provision for student 
immunizations. Also, the value that 
relatives and friends of a deceased 
person would gain from obtaining the 
protected health information of the 
decedent that they would not otherwise 
be able to obtain because there is no 
personal representative or, if there is a 
personal representative, without the 
delay of obtaining authorization, is 
beyond our ability to measure. We 
welcome comments and information 
that could improve our analysis of the 
benefits of the proposed rule. 
E. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
requires agencies that issue a proposed 
rule to analyze and consider options for 
reducing regulatory burden if the 
regulation will impose a significant 
burden on a substantial number of small 
entities. The Act requires the head of 
the agency to either certify that the rule 
would not impose such a burden or 
perform a regulatory flexibility analysis 
and consider alternatives to lessen the 
burden. 
The proposed rule would have an 
impact on covered providers of health 
care, health insurance issuers, and third 
party administrators acting on behalf of 
health plans, which we estimate to total 
701,325. Of the approximately $166.1 
million in costs we are able to identify, 
the private sector will incur 
approximately 71 percent of the costs or 
$118.1 million. The average cost per 
covered entity is therefore 
approximately $168. We do not view 
this as a significant burden. We note 
that the 3,500 third party administrators 
included in this calculation serve as 
business associates to the approximately 
446,000 ERISA plans, most of which are 
small entities. We have no information 
on how many of these plans self- 
administer, and we request any data the 
public may provide on this question. 
Based on the relatively small cost per 
covered entity, the Secretary certifies 
that the proposed rule would not have 
a significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. However, 
because we are not certain of all the 
costs this rule may impose or the exact 
number of small health insurers or third 
party administrators, we welcome 
comments that may further inform our 
analysis. 
Although we certify that the proposed 
rule will not impose a significant 
burden on a substantial number of small 
entities, in drafting the proposed 
provisions of the rule, we considered 
alternatives for reducing the burden on 
small entities. 
First, in the rule we are proposing to 
allow covered entities and business 
associates with existing HIPAA 
compliant contracts twelve months from 
the compliance date to renegotiate their 
contracts unless the contract is renewed 
or modified before such date. This 
amount of time plus the six months 
from the effective date of the rule to the 
compliance date generally gives the 
parties 18 months to renegotiate their 
agreements. We believe that the added 
time will reduce the cost to revise 
agreements because the changes the rule 
requires will be incorporated into the 
routine updating of covered entities and 
business associates contracts. 
Second, as we did in the final Privacy 
Rule published August 14, 2002 (67 FR 
53182, 53264–53266) we will provide 
sample language for revising the 
contracts between covered entities and 
business associates. While the language 
is generic and may not suit complex 
organizations with complex agreements, 
we believe that it will help small 
entities with their contract revisions and 
save them time and money in redrafting 
their contracts to conform to the new 
rules. 
VIII. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), agencies are required to 
provide a 60-day notice in the Federal 
Register and solicit public comment 
before a collection of information 
requirement is submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for 
review and approval. In order to fairly 
evaluate whether an information 
collection should be approved by OMB, 
section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA 
requires that we solicit comment on the 
following issues: 
a. Whether the information collection 
is necessary and useful to carry out the 
proper functions of the agency; 
b. The accuracy of the agency’s 
estimate of the information collection 
burden; 
c. The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and 
d. Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
Under the PRA, the time, effort, and 
financial resources necessary to meet 
the information collection requirements 
referenced in this section are to be 
considered. We explicitly seek, and will 
consider, public comment on our

A. Abstract 
As a result of the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical 
Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of 
Division A and Title IV of Division B of 
the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. 
L. 111–5), the Office for Civil Rights 
(OCR) is required to revise its 
information collection under the Health 
Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR 
Parts 160 and 164). ARRA was enacted 
on February 17, 2009. This supporting 
statement revises a previously approved 
OCR data collection, OMB # 0990–0294. 
The HITECH Act requires modification 
of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
(Pub. L. 104–191) implementing 
regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, 
the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 
to extend jurisdiction to business 
associates and to strengthen privacy and

security protections for health 
information. 
We have integrated this PRA notice 
into the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
because these costs represent costs to be 
incurred as one-time, first year 
implementation costs. The estimated 
annualized burden table below was 
developed using the same estimates and 
workload assumptions in the impact 
statement in the section regarding 
Executive Order 12866, above. Because 
the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules 
have been in effect for several years, 
these numbers, as revised pursuant to 
the HITECH modifications, are based on 
past experience with the current 
information collection. 
With respect to the § 164.520 
requirement to revise the Notice of 
Privacy Practices, the ‘‘Number of 
Respondents’’ column represents the 
number of covered entities that would 
be required to revise their Notices of 
Privacy Practices pursuant to the 
HITECH modifications. As such, 
701,500 covered entities would be 
required to modify their Notices of 
Privacy Practices. Each covered entity 
would have to revise one Notice of 
Privacy Practices, which is represented 
by the ‘‘Average Number of Responses 
per Respondent’’ column. We estimate 
that each revision would require 20 
minutes to complete. As such, it would 
take 233,833 total burden hours for 
701,500 covered entities to revise their 
Notices of Privacy Practices. With 
respect to the § 164.520 requirement for 
health plans to disseminate the revised 
Notice of Privacy Practices, the ‘‘Number 
of Respondents’’ column represents the 
200 million individuals to whom the 
revised Notice of Privacy Practices 
would be sent. Each individual would 
receive one Notice of Privacy Practices, 
which is represented by the ‘‘Average 
Number of Responses per Respondent’’ 
column. We estimate that each health 
plan would need one hour to prepare 
100 Notices of Privacy Practices for 
mailing to individuals. As such, the 
total burden hours it would take health 
plans to disseminate Notices of Privacy 
Practices to 200 million individuals 
would be two million. 
With regard to the proposed business 
associate provisions, as discussed in 
Section VI of this proposed rule, we 
assume that business associates 
currently comply with the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Rules, and that 
their contracts range from the minimal 
compliance to avoid contract 
termination to being fully compliant. 
Because the proposed rule provides that 
most business associates may 
renegotiate their contracts during the 
compliance period in the normal course 
of business, we anticipate no or minimal 
additional burden. However, for those 
business associates with subcontractors, 
we anticipate an increased burden 
associated with bringing their 
subcontractors into compliance with the 
HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 
specifically with regard to business 
associate agreements. 
Currently, business associates must 
obtain satisfactory assurance from their 
subcontractors regarding their 
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules. We assume that 
business associates obtained this 
satisfactory assurance via contract with 
their subcontractors. This proposed rule 
contains a new explicit requirement that 
business associates enter into contracts 
with their subcontractors to ensure 
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules. Because most 
business associates already have 
contracts in place, this new requirement 
creates a minimal additional burden 
associated with modification of these 
contracts. As discussed in Section VI 
above, we estimated that it will require 
one hour of a legal professional’s time 
to modify these contracts. We estimate 
the number of business associates that 
may have to bring subcontractors into 
compliance to be 1,500,000. Our 
estimate is based on an average of one 
to two million business associates. This 
correlates to 1,500,000 burden hours. 
The overall total for respondents to 
comply with the information collection 
requirements of the Rules is 3,733,833 
burden hours. We request comment on 
this estimate. 
As discussed in the above paragraph, 
we consider the majority of, if not all of, 
the burden associated with this 
proposed rule to result from the 
requirements with regard to the Notice 
of Privacy Practices and costs for 
business associates. However, as there 
may be an additional minimal burden 
associated with other provisions of the 
proposed rule, we request comment on 
the impacts of such provisions, as 
follows. 
With regard to the proposed 
marketing, sale, fundraising, and access 
provisions discussed above in Section 
VI of this proposed rule, we do not 
anticipate any significant increase in the 
burden to covered entities and business 
associates, because covered entities 
already have in place routine business 
policies, procedures, and forms to 
address the current requirements 
regarding an opt-out for fundraising, 
authorizations for marketing and sale of 
protected health information, and the 
provision of access to electronic 
protected health information. While the 
proposed rule strengthens consumer 
protections in each of these areas, we do 
not have sufficient data on the current 
marketing, sale, fundraising, and access 
activities of covered entities and their 
business associates to calculate the 
impact of the increased protections on 
the use of these forms and processes.

due to willful neglect. 
(b) The Secretary may conduct a

covered entity or business associate has 
complied or is complying with the 
applicable administrative simplification 
provisions. 
(b) Cooperate with complaint 
investigations and compliance reviews. 
A covered entity or business associate

administrative simplification 
provisions. If the Secretary determines

when documents may be hidden or 
destroyed, a covered entity or business 
associate must permit access by the 
Secretary at any time and without 
notice. 
(2) If any information required of a 
covered entity or business associate 
under this section is in the exclusive 
possession of any other agency, 
institution, or person and the other 
agency, institution, or person fails or 
refuses to furnish the information, the 
covered entity or business associate

with an investigation or compliance 
review under this subpart will not be

necessary for ascertaining or enforcing 
compliance with the applicable 
administrative simplification 
provisions, if otherwise required by law, 
or if permitted under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b)(7). 
14. Revise § 160.312 to read as 
follows: 
§ 160.312 Secretarial action regarding 
complaints and compliance reviews. 
(a) Resolution when noncompliance is 
indicated. 
(1) If an investigation of a complaint 
pursuant to § 160.306 or a compliance 
review pursuant to § 160.308 indicates 
noncompliance, the Secretary may 
attempt to reach a resolution of the 
matter satisfactory to the Secretary by 
informal means. Informal means may 
include demonstrated compliance or a

permission for the same or another 
research study. This exception includes 
combining an authorization for the use 
or disclosure of protected health 
information for a research study with 
another authorization for the same 
research study, with an authorization

has conditioned the provision of 
research-related treatment on the 
provision of one of the authorizations, 
as permitted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section, any compound 
authorization created under this 
paragraph must clearly differentiate 
between the conditioned and 
unconditioned components and provide 
the individual with an opportunity to 
opt in to the research activities 
described in the unconditioned 
authorization.

disclosure of psychotherapy notes may

except when a covered entity has 
conditioned the provision of treatment, 
payment, enrollment in the health plan, 
or eligibility for benefits under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section on the 
provision of one of the authorizations. 
The prohibition in this paragraph on 
combining authorizations where one 
authorization conditions the provision 
of treatment, payment, enrollment in a 
health plan, or eligibility for benefits 
under paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
does not apply to a compound 
authorization created in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
