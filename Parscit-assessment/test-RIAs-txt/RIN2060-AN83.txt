EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ES.1 Overview
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) estimates the incremental costs and monetized 
human health benefits of attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard (NAAQS) nationwide.  There are important overall data limitations and uncertainties in 
these estimates.  They are described in section E.S.4 below.  Hypothetical control strategies were 
developed for five alternative Pb standards encompassing the proposed range of 0.1 μg/m3 to 0.3 
μg/m3, as well as alternative standards of 0.5 μg/m3 and 0.05 μg/m3. For the RIA to be issued 
with the final rulemaking, the agency will analyze at least one more stringent and one less 
stringent alternative than the selected standard consistent with the OMB Circular A-4 Guidelines.  
This summary outlines the basis for and approach used for estimating the incremental costs and 
monetized benefits of these standards, presents the key results of the analysis, and highlights key 
uncertainties and limitations.  
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides illustrative estimates of the incremental 
costs and monetized human health benefits of attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) within the current monitoring network1.  Many of the 
highest-emitting Pb sources do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors, and it is important to note that 
there may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.  
Because of time and data constraints, in this RIA, estimates of costs and benefits employed 
different techniques for estimating future air quality. This results in benefits estimates that 
represent full attainment, and cost estimates that do not represent full attainment.  These 
differences will be addressed in the final RIA, and further improvements to estimation 
techniques will be explored.
It is important to note at the outset that overall data limitations are very significant for 
this analysis, compared to other NAAQS reviews. One critical area of uncertainty is the limited 
TSP-Pb monitoring network (discussed in chapter 2).  Because monitors are present in only 86 
counties nationwide, the universe of monitors exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very 
small; only 36 counties above 0.05 µg/m3, and only 24 counties exceeding the lowest proposed 
NAAQS level of 0.10 µg/m3. Because we know that many of the highest-emitting Pb sources in 
the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors (see section 2.1.7), it is likely that there may 
be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this RIA. It is also 
important to note that the addition of unidentified controls to sources above a specific level of 
emissions (see section 4.4.3) does not bring all areas all the way to attainment for four of the five 
alternative standards analyzed.  Because benefits were calculated assuming that each monitor 
just attains each standard alternative, this creates a potential mismatch between the costs and 
benefits calculated for each projected non-attainment area.  
In addition, EPA would prefer to use a detailed air quality model that simulates the 
dispersion and transport of lead to estimate local ambient lead concentrations with the

ug/m3.

hypothetical alternative emission control strategies expected under the proposed NAAQS.  
Although models with such capabilities are available for pollutants for which EPA frequently 
conducts air quality analyses (e.g., particulate matter and ozone), regional scale models are 
currently neither available nor appropriate for Pb2  As discussed in more detail below, EPA 
developed an air quality assessment tool to estimate the air quality impacts of each lead 
emissions control strategy. Finally, our initial analysis of control costs employs a simple fixed 
cost-per-ton methodology for unidentified point source controls.  These cost estimates will be 
revised and improved during development of the RIA for the final Pb NAAQS, and we intend to 
find ways to value unidentified controls that do no use a single constant cost per ton.  
In setting primary ambient air quality standards, EPA’s responsibility under the law is to 
establish standards that protect public health, regardless of the costs of implementing a new 
standard. The Clean Air Act requires EPA, for each criteria pollutant, to set a standard that 
protects public health with “an adequate margin of safety.” As interpreted by the Agency and the 
courts, the Act requires EPA to create standards based on health considerations only. 
The prohibition against the consideration of cost in the setting of the primary air quality 
standard, however, does not mean that costs or other economic considerations are unimportant or 
should be ignored. The Agency believes that consideration of costs and benefits is essential to 
making efficient, cost effective decisions for implementation of these standards. The impacts of 
cost and efficiency are considered by states during this process, as they decide what timelines, 
strategies, and policies are most appropriate. This RIA is intended to inform the public about the 
potential costs and benefits associated with a hypothetical scenario that may result when a new 
lead standard is implemented, but is not relevant to establishing the standards themselves. 
The analysis year for this regulatory impact analysis is 2020, consistent with the 
previously completed PM2.5 NAAQS RIA analysis which also used 2020 as its analysis year.  
For the purposes of this analysis, we assess attainment by 2020 for all areas. Some areas for 
which we assume 2020 attainment may in fact need more time to meet one or more of the 
analyzed standards, while others will need less time. This analysis does not prejudge the 
attainment dates that will ultimately be assigned to individual areas under the Clean Air Act, 
which provides flexibility to postpone compliance dates, provided that the date is as expeditious 
as practicable. 
This analysis is preliminary and only attempts to assess a hypothetical scenario.  In 
addition to the data limitations discussed earlier in this summary, the methods limitations affect 
the usefulness of this analysis.  For the RIA to be issued with the final rulemaking, the agency 
will be refining the analysis presented in this RIA and undertaking additional analyses, including 
multiple approaches to estimating the cost of needed reductions when the sources are not clearly 
identified.   While the final RIA will not specifically quantify effects of changing the ambient air 
Pb on adults, it will contain suggestions on where additional information and data would be 
useful to help characterize the adult benefits for the next 5-year review.  EPA will also

investigate doing a cost-effectiveness analysis and more formal uncertainty analysis as part of 
the final RIA.
As a result of some of the methodological considerations and uncertainties in developing 
this analysis, this draft RIA does not present a comparison of the estimated benefits and costs, or 
a net benefits calculation associated with each of the standard level alternatives under 
consideration.  EPA has activities underway to make improvements to both cost and benefit 
calculations for the final RIA, recognizing that there will remain significant data gaps and 
uncertainties.   EPA plans to present a net benefits calculation in the final RIA.
EPA presents this RIA pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the guidelines of OMB 
Circular A-4.3 These documents present guidelines for EPA to assess the benefits and costs of 
the selected regulatory option, as well as one less stringent and one more stringent option. OMB 
circular A-4 also requires both a benefit-cost, and a cost-effectiveness analysis for rules where 
health is the primary effect. Within this RIA we provide a benefit-cost analysis. 
ES.2 Summary of Analytic Approach 
Our assessment of the proposed lead NAAQS includes several key elements, including 
specification of baseline lead emissions and concentrations; development of illustrative control 
strategies to attain the alternative standards in 2020; development of an air quality assessment 
tool to assess the air quality impacts of these control strategies; and analyses of the incremental 
impacts of attaining the alternative standards.  Figure ES-1 provides an illustration of the 
methodological framework of this RIA. Additional information on the methods employed by the 
Agency for this RIA is presented below.
Overview of Baseline Emissions Forecast and Baseline Lead Concentrations
The baseline lead emissions and lead concentrations for this RIA are based on lead 
emissions data from the 2002 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and lead concentration values 
for 36 lead monitors included in the 2003-2005 Pb-TSP NAAQS-review database.  Consistent 
with the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and ozone RIA, no growth factors were applied to the 2002 NEI 
emissions estimates to generate the emissions or air quality projections for 2020.  Where 
possible, however, we adjusted these values to reflect the estimated control efficiency of MACT 
standards with post-2002 compliance deadlines, because the 2002 NEI and observed lead 
concentrations during the 2003-2005 period would not reflect the impact of MACT controls 
reasonably anticipated to be in place by 2020.  The analysis includes similar adjustments for 
compliance measures required by the September 2006 revision to the PM2.5 NAAQS (as included 
in the illustrative PM2.5 control strategy described in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA) and measures listed 
in the 2007 Missouri Lead SIP revisions.4

It should be noted again that overall data limitations are very significant for this analysis. 
One critical area of uncertainty is the limited TSP-Pb monitoring network.  Because monitors are 
present in only 86 counties nationwide, the universe of monitors exceeding the various target 
NAAQS levels is very small; only 36 counties above 0.05 µg/m3, and only 24 counties exceeding 
the lowest proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 µg/m3.  Because we know that many of the highest-
emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors, it is likely that there 
may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.
Development of Illustrative Control Strategies
 
Our analysis of the emissions control measures required to meet the proposed and 
alternative standards is limited to controls for point source emissions at active sources 
inventoried in the 2002 NEI.  To identify point source lead emissions controls for our analysis, 
we collected information on PM control technologies, assuming that the control efficiency for 
PM would also apply to lead emissions.  Most of this information was obtained from EPA's 
AirControlNET database, but a limited number of controls were identified from New Source 
Performance Standards and operating permits that apply to facilities with similar Source 
Classification Codes as the point sources included in our analysis.5  Controls identified through 
this process include major emissions controls, such as fabric filters, impingement-plate 
scrubbers, and electrostatic precipitators; and minor controls, such as increased monitoring 
frequency, upgrades to continuous emissions monitors, and diesel particulate filters for stationary 
sources.

TO BE INCLUDED IN FINAL RIA
ES-6
To identify the least-cost approach for reaching attainment in each area, EPA developed a linear 
programming optimization model that systematically evaluates the changes in air quality and 
costs associated with controlling each source to find the optimal control strategy for each area.  
The optimization model first identifies the measures that each source would implement if it were 
controlled as part of a local lead attainment strategy.  Based on these controls, the optimization 
model then identifies sources to control such that each area would reach attainment at the least 
aggregate cost possible for the area.  
Some monitor areas are not projected to reach attainment with the proposed NAAQS or 
alternative standard through the application of identified controls alone.  In order to bring these 
monitor areas into attainment, we simulated the application of unidentified emissions controls on 
“large” emissions sources, defined as those sources emitting 0.05 tons/year or more in the 2002 
NEI.  We limited our consideration of unidentified controls to these sources in order to target 
facilities that will likely be the focus of efforts of local air quality managers to comply with the 
new NAAQS.  Of the 2,230 point sources (excluding airports) in our analysis, 7.8 percent (174 
sources) satisfy the 0.05 annual tpy (100 pound) or greater criteria, but they account for more 
than 97 percent of total adjusted baseline emissions.  Based on the estimated control efficiency of 
identified controls, our analysis assumes that unidentified controls have a control efficiency of 90 
percent.  For each standard, we selected all monitor areas that failed to reach attainment and 
applied unidentified controls to large sources until attainment was reached.    
Air Quality Assessment Tool
To assess the air quality impact of the emissions controls implemented under the 
proposed NAAQS, EPA would ideally use a detailed air quality model that simulates the 
dispersion and transport of lead to estimate local ambient lead concentrations.  Although models 
with such capabilities are available for pollutants for which EPA frequently conducts air quality 
analyses (e.g., particulate matter and ozone), regional scale models are currently neither available 
nor appropriate for Pb.6 Dispersion, or plume-based, models are recommended for compliance 
with the Pb NAAQS; however, dispersion models are data –intensive and more appropriate for 
local scale analyses of emissions from individual sources.  It was not feasible to conduct such a 
large-scale data-intensive analysis for this RIA. 
Our air quality assessment tool, developed for the purposes of this analysis, employs a 
source-apportionment approach to estimate the extent to which each of the following emissions 
sources contribute to observed lead concentrations in each monitor area:
· Background lead 
· Miscellaneous, re-entrained dust
· Emissions from area non-point sources
  
6 See Chapter 2 of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (2007). Review of the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards for Lead: Policy Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information – OAQPS Staff Paper. Office of Air 
Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC. EPA-452/R-07-013.
ES-7
· Indirect fugitive emissions from active industrial sites
· Point source emissions7
After allocating a portion of the observed lead concentration for each monitor area to the 
first four categories listed above, the assessment tool apportions the remaining concentration 
among all inventoried point sources within ten kilometers of each monitor location by distance-
weighting individual source contributions to ambient Pb concentrations.8 Through this process, 
the tool establishes a point source influence factor that can be used to translate changes in the 
lead emissions of individual point sources to changes in the lead concentration for each monitor 
area.   
Analysis of Benefits
Our analysis of the benefits associated with the proposed Lead NAAQS includes benefits 
related to reducing ambient lead concentrations and the ancillary benefits of reducing direct 
emissions of particulate matter.  To assess benefits specific to reduced lead concentrations, we 
created a spreadsheet model that provides a screening-level assessment of health benefits 
occurring as a result of implementing alternative NAAQS levels.  The model uses various 
simplifying assumptions and is intended only to provide an approximate, preliminary estimate of 
the potential health benefits.  For the purposes of this analysis, the model estimates the adverse 
health impact of blood lead levels on cognitive function (which is most often measured as 
changes in IQ) in young children below seven years of age.  Cognitive effects are thought to 
strongly relate to a child’s future productivity and earning potential.9  
The model was constructed in Microsoft Excel™ and provides an integrated tool to 
complete five benefits estimation steps: 1) estimate lead in air concentrations for the “base case” 
and “control scenarios”; 2) estimate population exposures to air lead concentrations for each 
scenario; 3) estimate blood lead levels in the population for each scenario; 4) estimate avoided 
cases of health effects due to changes in blood lead levels; and 5) apply an economic unit value 
to each avoided case to calculate total monetized benefits.  EPA plans to refine the model as it 
progresses towards a final NAAQS level for lead.  
Because most of the point source measures implemented to achieve the NAAQS 
standards are focused on controlling emissions of lead in particulate form, virtually all of these 
measures also have a significant impact on emissions of directly emitted particulate matter.  To 
  
7 For the purposes of this analysis, airports servicing piston-engine aircraft that use leaded aviation gasoline are 
treated as point sources.
8 Note that although the air quality assessment tool distinguishes between the portion of the observed lead 
concentration attributable to point source emissions and that attributable to indirect fugitive emissions from active 
point sources, this analysis assumes that the two contributions are directly related, and any reduction in the air 
quality impact of point source emissions would produce a corresponding reduction in the air quality impact of 
indirect fugitive emissions from point sources in that monitor area.  The process used to relate the contributions of 
these two categories is described in further detail in Chapter 3 of this RIA.

estimate the value of these PM2.5 emissions reductions, EPA utilized PM2.5 benefit-per-ton 
estimates. These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human health 
benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of PM2.5
from a specified source. EPA has used a similar technique in previous RIAs, including the recent 
ozone NAAQS RIA.10  The complete methodology for creating the benefit per-ton estimates 
used in this analysis is available in the Technical Support Document (TSD) accompanying the 
recent final ozone NAAQS RIA.11
Analysis of Costs
Consistent with our development of the illustrative control strategies described above, our 
analysis of the costs associated with the proposed lead NAAQS focuses on point source PM 
controls.  For the purposes of this analysis, these controls largely include measures from the 
AirControlNET control technology database, but also include additional measures associated 
with operating permits and/or New Source Performance Review standards applicable to sources 
similar to those included in our analysis.  For controls identified in AirControlNET, we estimated
costs based on the cost equations included in AirControlNET.  Our cost estimates for controls 
associated with operating permits and/or New Source Performance Review standards are based 
on cost data compiled by EPA for previous analyses.
As indicated in the above discussion on illustrative control strategies, implementation of 
the PM control measures identified from AirControlNET and other sources does not result in 
attainment with the proposed or alternative lead standards in several areas.  In these areas, 
additional unidentified measures will likely be necessary to reach attainment.  To estimate the 
costs associated with unidentified measures, we assume an annual fixed cost of $32 million/ton, 
or $16,000/pound.  This value represents the 98th percentile of the cost/ton for identified controls 
at large point sources of lead (i.e., sources emitting at least 0.05 tons of lead per year).12
ES.3 Results of Analysis
Air Quality
Table ES-1 summarizes the number of monitor sites that reach attainment with the 
proposed NAAQS and alternative standards in 2020 following the implementation of identified 
and unidentified controls.  According to the data presented in Table ES-2, 20 of the 36 monitor 
areas are expected to reach attainment with any target NAAQS in the proposed  range of 0.1 to

EPA-HQ-OAR-2007-0225-0284.
12 The fixed cost estimate for unidentified controls was developed based on the cost of controls with a 3 percent 
discount rate.  Because it is a fixed cost, however, when applied to estimate the costs of unidentified controls it is 
assumed not to be affected by the discount rate assumption.  That is, costs for unidentified controls are assumed to 
be the same for the 3 and 7 percent discount rate.

0.3 μg/m3 following implementation of identified controls.  For some areas, however, identified 
controls are not sufficient to reach attainment with one or more of the target alternatives in the 
proposed range.  For the alternative of 0.05 μg/m3, only 10 of the 36 monitors are able to reach 
attainment from application of identified controls.  By comparison, all but one monitor area 
reach attainment through the implementation of identified controls under the 0.5 μg/m3 standard.

The failure of certain areas to reach attainment with identified controls may partially 
reflect the lack of control information for point sources in these areas.  Sources for which the 
AirControlNET analysis identified no controls make up a significant portion of the ambient lead 
concentration in many of the areas not projected to reach attainment with the proposed standard.  
For such sources in nonattainment areas, we assume that unidentified controls will be applied.  
In addition to the lack of point source control information, some areas fail to reach 
attainment with the 0.05 μg/m3 target NAAQS following the implementation of identified 
controls because the fraction of the ambient lead concentration associated with area nonpoint 
sources and miscellaneous re-entrained dust exceeds the standard itself.  As indicated above, our 
analysis relies only on point source controls, which have no effect on the ambient lead fraction 
associated with nonpoint sources or miscellaneous re-entrained dust.  Therefore, even if point 
source emissions were reduced to zero in these areas, they would not reach attainment.
ES-10
When unidentified point source controls are implemented in addition to identified 
controls, we project more widespread attainment with the alternative standards.  As indicated 
above, we assume that these controls have a control efficiency of 90 percent and that they may 
be installed by any large point source (i.e., a point source emitting more than 0.05 tons of lead 
per year, as indicated in the 2002 NEI).  Following the application of unidentified controls, all 
monitor areas but one are projected to reach attainment with the 0.3 :g/m3 proposed standard 
and the 0.2 :g/m3 proposed standard.  For the 0.1 :g/m3 proposed standard, six monitor areas are 
not projected to reach attainment with the application of unidentified controls, either because 
control efficiencies greater than 90 percent would be required at large sources or because small 
sources would need to be controlled to sufficiently reduce ambient lead concentrations.  For the 
0.05 :g/m3 alternative standard, seventeen monitor areas are not projected to reach attainment 
with any application of unidentified controls, for the reasons given above and because the 
fraction of the ambient concentration associated with area nonpoint sources and miscellaneous 
re-entrained dust at some areas exceeds the standard itself. In contrast, all 36 monitor areas are 
projected to reach attainment with the 0.5 μg/m3 standard following the implementation of 
unidentified controls.
Benefit and Cost Estimates
Tables ES-2 and ES-3 summarizes the benefits and costs associated with the proposed and 
alternative NAAQS standards in 2020, based on both 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates.  
Additional analysis of benefits under alternative assumptions is available as a memo in the 
docket titled: Supplemental IQ Gain Calculations Using Two Additional Concentration-
Response Functions.
 
The results in Table ES-2 show that unidentified controls represent the majority of costs 
incurred by affected sources.  This reflects the limited information available to EPA on the 
control measures that lead sources may implement.  It is important to remember that, compared 
to recent NAAQS RIAs, our current knowledge of the costs and nature of lead emissions controls 
is relatively poor.  Lead in ambient air has not been a focus for all but a few areas of the country 
for the last decade or more; the alternative standards represent a substantial tightening of the 
existing NAAQS.  As a result, although AirControlNET contains information on a large number 
of different point source controls, we would expect that State and local air quality managers 
would have access to additional information on the controls available to the most significant 
sources.
Table ES-3 presents the benefits of the proposed and alternative standards as a range to 
account for uncertainties associated with the benefits of the standards.  The range in the benefits 
estimates related to IQ gains reflects two estimates of the earnings impacts associated with such 
gains.  The low end of the range reflects an analysis by Schwartz, which estimated that a 1-point 
increase in IQ would increase earnings by 1.76 percent, while the high end of the range reflects
the results of Salkever, which found that earnings increase by 2.38 percent for each 1-point

** Range for benefits associated with IQ gains reflects two separate estimates of the effect of IQ on earnings.  The low end of the range reflects an analysis 
by Schwartz (1994), which estimated that a 1-point increase in IQ would increase earnings by 1.76 percent.  The high end of the range reflects the results 
of Salkever (1995), which found that earnings increase by 2.38 percent for each 1-point increase in IQ.
*** Range for PM co-control benefits is based on the lower and upper ends of the range of the PM2.5 premature mortality functions characterized in the expert 
elicitation.  Range for total benefits was developed by adding monetized lead IQ benefits to the ends of the co-control benefits range.  Tables exclude all 
adult health effects benefits, as well as unquantified and nonmonetized benefits.

To provide additional context for the results presented in Table ES-3, Table ES-4
presents the total number of IQ points expected to be gained in the US in the year 2020 by 
achieving each of the alternate NAAQS level options, relative to the “base case” (i.e., the lead 
NAAQS remains at its current level).  The results presented in the table demonstrate that 
lowering the current (1.5 μg/m3 maximum quarterly mean) lead NAAQS to one of the proposed
or alternative NAAQS would be expected to have a significant impact on the IQ of young 
children.  More specifically, the results indicate that the number of IQ points gained in 2020 
ranges from 110,000 if a 0.5 μg/m3 second maximum monthly mean NAAQS is achieved up to 
700,000 for a 0.05 μg/m3 second maximum monthly mean NAAQS.  
Table ES-4.  
NUMBER OF IQ POINTS GAINED IN 2020
Standard IQ Points Gained

0.1 μg/m3 Second Maximum Monthly Mean 440,000
0.05 μg/m3Second Maximum Monthly Mean 700,000
Our analysis suggests that the benefits presented in Table ES-4 will be concentrated in a small 
number of counties.  Table ES-5 below is an example of the distribution of total benefits due to 
IQ points gained for the 0.2 μg/m3 second maximum monthly mean NAAQS alternative.  For this 
standard, approximately 60 percent of the total benefits are due to changes in lead air 
concentrations in three counties: Hillsborough, Florida; Delaware, Indiana; and Berks, PA.    In 
these areas, sources of lead exposure and the monitors that measure ambient lead appear to be in 
relatively close proximity to exposed populations.

The costs of the proposed and alternative lead NAAQS are also expected to be 
concentrated in a limited number of areas, as summarized in chapter 6.  Many of the monitor 
sites listed in the exhibit represent areas with the largest sources of lead emissions, such as 
primary or secondary lead smelters, mining operations, or battery manufacturers.  
ES.4 Caveats and Limitations
Air Quality Data, Modeling and Emissions
· Limited TSP-Pb monitoring network. Because monitors are present in only 86 counties 
nationwide, the universe of monitors exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very 
small; only 36 counties above 0.05 µg/m3, and only 24 counties exceeding the lowest 
proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 µg/m3.  Because we know that many of the highest-
emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors (see section 
2.1.7), it is likely that there may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have 
been analyzed in this RIA.
· Simplified Air Quality Assessment Approach. Dispersion, or plume-based models are 
recommended for compliance with the Pb NAAQS; however, dispersion models are 
data–intensive and more appropriate for local scale analyses of emissions from individual 
sources.  It was not feasible to conduct such a large-scale data intensive analysis for this 
RIA.  As a result, the simplified analysis developed for this RIA while distance-
weighting individual source contributions to ambient Pb concentrations, could not 
account for such locally critical variables as meteorology and source stack height.
· Analysis Only Considers Controls on Point Source Emission Reductions.  Because the 
available data are not sufficiently detailed to assess the impact of indirect fugitive or area 
nonpoint source controls, the analysis of air quality impacts does not account for the 
potential implementation of such controls in areas where they might be effective.  
Although the analysis estimates the impact of point source controls on indirect fugitives, 
it does not consider the impact of controlling these emissions directly.  This and the lack 
of control information for area nonpoint sources may have contributed to our projection 
of nonattainment in some areas.  Additionally, for this analysis we have not modeled the 
effect of any potential changes in emissions at airports with lead emissions associated 
with use of leaded aviation gasoline by piston-engine powered aircraft.  (EPA received a 
petition from Friends of the Earth requesting that the Agency find that aircraft lead 
emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare, and to 
take action to control lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft.  EPA, in coordination 
with FAA, is analyzing the petition.)
· Limited Point Source Controls Considered. As discussed above, we were not able to 
obtain emissions control information for a large number of point sources in our analysis.  
Although these sources collectively accounted for less than one fourth of all lead 
emissions considered, many of those sources were located in areas that were not able to 
reach attainment with one or more of the standards using identified controls alone.  
 17
· Actual State Implementation Plans May Differ from our Simulation.  In order to reach 
attainment with the proposed NAAQS, each state will develop its own implementation 
plan implementing a combination of emissions controls that may differ from those 
simulated in this analysis.  This analysis therefore represents an approximation of the 
emissions reductions that would be required to reach attainment and should not be treated 
as a precise estimate.
· Emissions Reduction from Unidentified Controls. In this RIA, we report emissions 
reductions from both identified and unidentified emissions controls.  We have taken care 
to report these separately, in recognition of the greater uncertainty associated with 
achieving emissions reductions from measures that may not be currently in use or known 
to EPA.  Nonetheless, EPA believes it is reasonable to project that, with at least 10 years 
of lead time before a 2020 compliance deadline, a large number of existing measures will 
be adapted to be applicable to additional sources, and new measures may be developed 
that are specifically focused on cost-effectively reducing PM emissions with high lead 
content.  Because the current standard is attained in all but a few areas of the country, and 
has been for many years since the phase down of lead in gasoline, it is likely that very 
little effort has been devoted to development of lead emissions control technologies 
except for industries where regulations have been imposed to reduce lead (e.g., large 
MWC standard, primary and secondary lead smelter MACTs, etc.).  
Costs
· Uncertainty associated with unidentified measures. As indicated above, many areas are 
expected to rely heavily on unidentified controls to reach attainment with the standards.  
The cost of implementing these measures, though estimated here based on the costs for 
identified controls, is uncertain. Many of these sources are already well-controlled for 
particulate matter, and additional control for the remaining increment of Pb might be 
difficult to achieve. Many other sources are boilers fired by natural gas, whose emissions 
we are currently investigating and which are likely to be overstated.  Some sources have 
very low particulate matter (PM) emissions overall, and therefore controls are generally 
not found at that emissions level.
Benefits
· Exposure. The benefits of IQ point gains in children were very sensitive to the method 
employed for estimating exposures to the population.  When comparing the default 
method, which involved concentrations that were interpolated from multiple monitors, to 
the method assuming a uniform concentration within a 10 km radius around an individual 
monitor, the results increase by 31 percent. Increasing the radius to include the entire 
county in which the monitor resides results in roughly 3-fold increase in benefits.  
Decreasing the radius size also has a large impact on benefits, decreasing the value by as 
much as 98 percent when a radius of 1 km is used.
 18
· Dose-response relationship. The dose-response function selected for quantifying the 
number of IQ points gained as a result of achieving the alternative NAAQS levels 
affected the results.  Utilizing alternate epidemiological studies decreased the primary 
estimate by as much as 74 percent.  
· Earnings-based metric of IQ. The earnings-based value-per-IQ-point lost that we apply 
in this analysis most likely represents a lower bound on the true value of a lost IQ point, 
because it is essentially a cost-of-illness measure, not a measure of an individual’s 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid the loss of an IQ point.  Welfare economics 
emphasizes WTP measures as the more complete estimate of economic value.
· Co-control benefits related to PM.  Co-control benefits estimated here reflect the 
application of a national dollar benefit per ton estimate of the benefits of reducing 
directly emitted fine particulates from point sources.  Because they are based on national-
level analysis, the benefit-per-ton estimates used here do not reflect local meteorology, 
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an over-
estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted fine 
particulates.  
ES.5 Conclusions and Insights
Our analysis has estimated the health benefits of reductions in ambient concentrations of 
lead resulting from a set of illustrative control strategies to reduce emissions of lead at point 
sources.  The results suggest there will be significant additional health benefits arising from 
reducing emissions from a variety of sources in and around projected nonattaining counties in 
2020. While 2020 is the latest date by which states would generally need to demonstrate 
attainment with the revised standards, it is expected that benefits (and costs) may begin occurring 
earlier, as states begin implementing control measures to show progress towards attainment.
There are several important factors to consider when evaluating either the benefits or the
costs of the attainment strategies for the four alternative standards assessed in this RIA:
· Our estimates of costs of attainment in 2020 assume a particular trajectory of what might 
be aggressive technological change. This trajectory leads to a particular level of 
emissions reductions and costs which we have estimated based on costs of identified 
controls.  An alternative storyline might hypothesize a much less optimistic technological 
change path, such that emissions reductions technologies for industrial sources would be 
more expensive or would be unavailable, so that emissions reductions from many smaller
sources might be required for 2020 attainment, at a potentially greater cost per ton. Under 
this alternative storyline, two outcomes are hypothetically possible: Under one scenario, 
total costs associated with full attainment might be substantially higher. Under the second 
scenario, states may choose to take advantage of flexibility in the Clean Air Act to adopt 
plans with later attainment dates to allow for additional technologies to be developed and 
for other programs be fully implemented.  If states were to submit plans with attainment 
dates beyond our 2020 analysis year, benefits would clearly be lower than we have 
estimated under our analytical storyline. 
 19
· Benefits and costs are distributed differently across potential non-attainment counties.  As 
presented in Table ES-5, most of the primary lead benefits of the standards are expected 
to be realized in a small number of areas.  These are areas where the sources of lead 
exposure and the monitors that measure ambient lead appear to be in relatively close 
proximity to exposed populations.  The identified control costs, on the other hand, are 
greatest in those areas with the largest sources of lead emissions - usually around primary 
or secondary lead smelters, mining operations, or battery manufacturers.  PM co-control 
benefits tend to be distributed in better correlation to control costs.  In general, PM co-
control benefits tend to be highest in those areas where our attainment strategy suggests 
controls on combustion sources, rather than metals processing, are necessary.
· Because of the limitations and uncertainties in the emissions and air quality components 
of our assessment, the specific control strategies that might be the most effective in 
helping areas to reach attainment are still very uncertain. For example, we employ a fairly 
simple distance-weighted dispersion approach to approximate the effect of controls on 
specific point sources in reducing concentrations at current monitor locations.  
As part of the development of the final RIA, EPA has activities underway to make 
improvements to both cost and benefit calculations, recognizing that there will remain significant 
data gaps and uncertainties.   As outlined above and in the individual chapters, we plan to 
investigate changes which will: better match locations of monitors and sources, refine our 
estimates of population exposures, broaden the number of concentration-response functions in 
the primary analysis, improve our estimates of emission reductions due to known controls, and 
improve the comparability of the costs and benefits.

CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Synopsis
This document estimates the incremental costs and monetized human health benefits of 
attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) 
nationwide. This document contains illustrative analyses that consider limited emission control 
scenarios that states, tribes and regional planning organizations might implement to achieve a 
revised lead NAAQS. In some cases, EPA weighed the available empirical data to make 
judgments regarding the proposed attainment status of certain urban areas in the future. 
According to the Clean Air Act, EPA must use health-based criteria in setting the NAAQS and 
cannot consider estimates of compliance cost. This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is 
intended to provide the public a sense of the benefits and costs of meeting new alternative lead 
NAAQS, and to meet the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 
(described below in Section 1.2.2). 
This RIA provides illustrative estimates of the incremental costs and monetized human 
health benefits of attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
(NAAQS) within the current monitoring network15.  Many of the highest-emitting Pb sources do 
not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors, and it is important to note that there may be many more 
potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.  Because of time and data 
constraints, in this RIA, estimates of costs and benefits employed different techniques for 
estimating future air quality. This results in benefits estimates that represent full attainment, and 
cost estimates that do not represent full attainment.  These differences will be addressed in the 
final RIA, and further improvements to estimation techniques will be explored.
1.1 Background
Two sections of the Clean Air Act (“Act”) govern the establishment and revision of 
NAAQS. Section 108 (42 U.S.C. 7408) directs the Administrator to identify pollutants which 
“may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,” and to issue air quality 
criteria for them. These air quality criteria are intended to “accurately reflect the latest scientific 
knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or 
welfare which may be expected from the presence of [a] pollutant in the ambient air.” Lead is 
one of six pollutants for which EPA has developed air quality criteria. 
Section 109 (42 U.S.C. 7409) directs the Administrator to propose and promulgate 
“primary” and “secondary” NAAQS for pollutants identified under section 108. Section 
109(b)(1) defines a primary standard as “the attainment and maintenance of which in the 
judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, 
[are] requisite to protect the public health.” A secondary standard, as defined in section 
109(b)(2), must “specify a level of air quality the attainment and maintenance of which in the 
  
15 There are currently 189 monitors representing 86 counties, but only 36 counties have monitors which exceed 0.05 
ug/m3.
1-2
judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria, [are] requisite to protect the public 
welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of [the] 
pollutant in the ambient air.” Welfare effects as defined in section 302(h) [42 U.S.C. 7602(h)] 
include but are not limited to “effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, 
animals, wildlife, weather, visibility and climate, damage to and deterioration of property, and 
hazards to transportation, as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and 
well-being.” 
Section 109(d) of the Act directs the Administrator to review existing criteria and 
standards at 5-year intervals. When warranted by such review, the Administrator is to retain or 
revise the NAAQS. After promulgation or revision of the NAAQS, the standards are 
implemented by the States. 
1.2 Role of the Regulatory Impact Analysis in the NAAQS Setting Process
1.2.1 Legislative Roles
In setting primary ambient air quality standards, EPA’s responsibility under the law is to 
establish standards that protect public health, regardless of the costs of implementing a new 
standard. The Clean Air Act requires EPA, for each criteria pollutant, to set a standard that 
protects public health with “an adequate margin of safety.” As interpreted by the Agency and the 
courts, the Act requires EPA to create standards based on health considerations only. 
The prohibition against the consideration of cost in the setting of the primary air quality 
standard, however, does not mean that costs or other economic considerations are unimportant or 
should be ignored. The Agency believes that consideration of costs and benefits are essential to 
making efficient, cost effective decisions for implementation of these standards. The impact of 
cost and efficiency are considered by states during this process, as they decide what timelines, 
strategies, and policies make the most sense. This RIA is intended to inform the public about the 
potential costs and benefits that may result when a new lead standard is implemented, but is not 
relevant to establishing the standards themselves. 
1.2.2 Role of Statutory and Executive Orders
There are several statutory and executive orders that dictate the manner in which EPA 
considers rulemaking and public documents. This document is separate from the NAAQS 
decision making process, but there are several statutes and executive orders that still apply to any 
public documentation. The analysis required by these statutes and executive orders is presented 
in Chapter 8.
EPA presents this RIA pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the guidelines of OMB 
Circular A-4.16 These documents present guidelines for EPA to assess the benefits and costs of 
  
16 U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Circular A-4, September 17, 2003. Found on the Internet at 
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a004/a-4.pdf>.

the selected regulatory option, as well as one less stringent and one more stringent option. OMB 
circular A-4 also requires both a benefit-cost, and a cost-effectiveness analysis for rules where 
health is the primary effect. Within this RIA we provide a benefit-cost analysis  EPA will 
undertake doing a cost-effectiveness analysis and more formal uncertainty analysis as part of the 
final RIA to the extent practicable.
1.2.3 Market Failure or Other Social Purpose
OMB Circular A-4 indicates that one of the reasons a regulation such as the NAAQS may 
be issued is to address market failure. The major types of market failure include: externality, 
market power, and inadequate or asymmetric information. Correcting market failures is one 
reason for regulation, but it is not the only reason. Other possible justifications include 
improving the function of government, removing distributional unfairness, or promoting privacy 
and personal freedom.
An externality occurs when one party’s actions impose uncompensated benefits or costs 
on another party. Environmental problems are a classic case of externality. For example, the 
smoke from a factory may adversely affect the health of local residents while soiling the property 
in nearby neighborhoods. If bargaining was costless and all property rights were well defined, 
people would eliminate externalities through bargaining without the need for government 
regulation. From this perspective, externalities arise from high transaction costs and/or poorly 
defined property rights that prevent people from reaching efficient outcomes through market 
transactions.
Firms exercise market power when they reduce output below what would be offered in a 
competitive industry in order to obtain higher prices. They may exercise market power 
collectively or unilaterally. Government action can be a source of market power, such as when 
regulatory actions exclude low-cost imports. Generally, regulations that increase market power 
for selected entities should be avoided. However, there are some circumstances in which 
government may choose to validate a monopoly. If a market can be served at lowest cost only 
when production is limited to a single producer of local gas and electricity distribution services, a 
natural monopoly is said to exist. In such cases, the government may choose to approve the 
monopoly and to regulate its prices and/or production decisions. Nevertheless, it should be noted 
that technological advances often affect economies of scale. This can, in turn, transform what 
was once considered a natural monopoly into a market where competition can flourish.
Market failures may also result from inadequate or asymmetric information. Because 
information, like other goods, is costly to produce and disseminate, an evaluation will need to do 
more than demonstrate the possible existence of incomplete or asymmetric information. Even 
though the market may supply less than the full amount of information, the amount it does 
supply may be reasonably adequate and therefore not require government regulation. Sellers 
have an incentive to provide information through advertising that can increase sales by 
highlighting distinctive characteristics of their products. Buyers may also obtain reasonably 
adequate information about product characteristics through other channels, such as a seller 
offering a warranty or a third party providing information.
1-4
There are justifications for regulations in addition to correcting market failures. A 
regulation may be appropriate when there are clearly identified measures that can make 
government operate more efficiently. In addition, Congress establishes some regulatory 
programs to redistribute resources to select groups. Such regulations should be examined to 
ensure that they are both effective and cost-effective. Congress also authorizes some regulations 
to prohibit discrimination that conflicts with generally accepted norms within our society. 
Rulemaking may also be appropriate to protect privacy, permit more personal freedom or 
promote other democratic aspirations.
From an economics perspective, setting an air quality standard is a straightforward case 
of addressing an externality, in this case where firms are emitting pollutants, which cause health 
and environmental problems without compensation for those suffering the problems. Setting a 
standard with a reasonable margin of safety attempts to place the cost of control on those who 
emit the pollutants and lessens the impact on those who suffer the health and environmental 
problems from higher levels of pollution.
1.2.4 Illustrative Nature of the Analysis
This Pb NAAQS RIA is an illustrative analysis that provides useful insights into a limited 
number of emissions control scenarios that states might implement to achieve a revised lead 
NAAQS. Because states are ultimately responsible for implementing strategies to meet any 
revised standard, the control scenarios in this RIA are necessarily hypothetical in nature. They 
are not forecasts of expected future outcomes. Important uncertainties and limitations are 
documented in the relevant portions of the analysis.
The illustrative goals of this RIA are somewhat different from other EPA analyses of 
national rules, or the implementation plans states develop, and the distinctions are worth brief 
mention. This RIA does not assess the regulatory impact of an EPA-prescribed national or 
regional rule such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, nor does it attempt to model the specific 
actions that any state would take to implement a revised lead standard. This analysis attempts to 
estimate the costs and human and welfare benefits of cost-effective implementation strategies 
which might be undertaken to achieve national attainment of new standards. These hypothetical 
strategies represent a scenario where states use one set of cost-effective controls to attain a 
revised lead NAAQS. Because states—not EPA—will implement any revised NAAQS, they will 
ultimately determine appropriate emissions control scenarios. State implementation plans would 
likely vary from EPA’s estimates due to differences in the data and assumptions that states use to 
develop these plans.
The illustrative attainment scenarios presented in this RIA were constructed with the 
understanding that there are inherent uncertainties in projecting emissions and controls. 
Furthermore, certain emissions inventory, control, modeling and monitoring limitations and 
uncertainties inhibit EPA’s ability to model full attainment in all areas. Despite these limitations, 
EPA has used the best available data and methods to produce this RIA.

1.3 Overview and Design of the RIA
This Regulatory Impact Analysis evaluates the costs and benefits of hypothetical national 
strategies to attain several potential revised primary lead standards. The document is intended to 
be straightforward and written for the lay person with a minimal background in chemistry, 
economics, and/or epidemiology. Figure 1-1 provides an illustration of the framework of this 
RIA. 
1.3.1 Baseline and Years of Analysis
The analysis year for this regulatory impact analysis is 2020, which allows EPA to be 
consistent with the previously completed PM NAAQS RIA analysis which also used 2020 as its 
analysis year. Many areas will reach attainment of any alternative Pb standard by 2020. For 
purposes of this analysis, we assess attainment by 2020 for all areas. Some areas for which we 
assume 2020 attainment may in fact need more time to meet one or more of the analyzed 
standards, while others will need less time. This analysis does not prejudge the attainment dates 
that will ultimately be assigned to individual areas under the Clean Air Act, which contains a 
variety of potential dates and flexibility to move to later dates (up to 20 years), provided that the 
date is as expeditious as practicable. 
The methodology first estimates what baseline lead levels might look like in 2020 with 
existing Clean Air Act programs, including application of controls to meet the current Pb 
NAAQS, various maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards, and the newly 
revised PM NAAQS standard, and then predicts the change in Pb levels following the 
application of additional controls to reach tighter alternative standards. This allows for an 
analysis of the incremental change between the current standard and alternative standards. This 
timeline is also consistent with expected attainment in 2020 of the revised Particulate Matter 
(PM) NAAQS covered in the PM NAAQS RIA issued in September 2006.  Since Pb is also a 
component of PM, it is important that we account for the impact on Pb concentrations of PM 
controls used in the hypothetical control scenario in the PM NAAQS RIA, so as to avoid double 
counting the benefits and costs of these controls.
1.3.2 Control Scenarios Considered in this RIA 
Hypothetical control strategies were developed for four alternative Pb standards 
encompassing the proposed range of 0.10 µg/m3 to 0.30 µg/m3, as well as alternative standards 
of 0.05 µg/m3 and 0.5 µg/m3, in order to illustrate how tighter standards might be met.  (For the 
RIA to be issued with the final rulemaking, the agency will analyze at least one more stringent 
and one less stringent alternative than the selected standard consistent with the OMB A-4 
Guidelines).  First, EPA developed an air quality assessment tool to estimate air quality changes 
that would result from the application of emissions control options that are known to be available 
to different types of sources in areas with monitoring levels currently exceeding the alternative 
standards. However, given the limitations of current technology and the amount of improvement 
in air quality needed to reach some alternative standards in some areas, it was also expected that 
applying these known controls would not reduce lead concentrations sufficiently to allow all 
1-7
areas to reach the more stringent standards. We then estimated the control efficiency of 
unidentified future controls based on the distribution of known control efficiencies at large 
industrial sources. We then hypothetically applied those controls in an iterative fashion to areas 
exceeding each alternative standard, until the alternative standard could be reached.
1.3.3 Evaluating Costs and Benefits
Applying a two step methodology for estimating emission reductions needed to reach full 
attainment enabled EPA to evaluate nationwide costs and benefits of attaining a tighter Pb 
standard using hypothetical strategies, albeit with substantial additional uncertainty regarding the 
second step estimates. First, the costs associated with applying known controls were quantified. 
Second, EPA estimated costs of the additional tons of extrapolated emission reductions estimated 
which were needed to reach full attainment. 
It is important to note that this analysis did not estimate any separate costs or benefits of 
attaining a secondary NAAQS standard due to resource and time constraints. Since the secondary 
is being set to be equivalent to the primary standard, no additional costs and benefits are 
expected.
To streamline this RIA, this document refers to several previously published documents, 
including three technical documents EPA produced to prepare for the Pb NAAQS proposal. The 
first was a Criteria Document created by EPA’s Office of Research and Development (published 
in 2006), which presented the latest available pertinent information on atmospheric science, air 
quality, exposure, dosimetry, health effect, and environmental effects of lead. The second was a 
“Staff Paper” (published in 2007) that evaluated the policy implications of the key studies and 
scientific information contained in the Criteria Document.  The third was a risk assessment for 
various standard levels. The Staff Paper also includes staff conclusions and recommendations to 
the Administrator regarding potential revisions to the standards. 
1.4 Pb Standard Alternatives Considered
EPA has performed an illustrative analysis of the potential costs and human health and 
visibility benefits of nationally attaining proposed alternative Pb standards of 0.10 ug/m3, 0.20 
ug/m3, and 0.30 ug/m3, as well as alternative standards of 0.05 µg/m3 and 0.5 µg/m3.  Per 
Executive Order 12866 and the guidelines of OMB Circular A-4, this Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (RIA) also presents analyses of a more stringent option of 0.05 ug/m3. The benefit and 
cost estimates below are calculated incremental to a 2020 baseline that incorporates air quality 
improvements achieved through the projected implementation of existing regulations and full 
attainment of the existing Pb and particulate matter (PM) National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS). The baseline also includes the MACT program, which will help many 
areas move toward attainment of the current lead standard.

CHAPTER 2.  CHARACTERIZING PB AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS DATA
This chapter describes the available Pb air quality and emission data used to inform and 
develop the controls strategies outlined in this RIA.  We first describe data sources for air quality 
measurement.  We then provide an overview of data on Pb emission sources contained in 
available EPA emission inventories.  For a more in-depth discussion of Pb air quality and 
emissions data, see the OAQPS Staff Paper for the Pb NAAQS.17
2.1 Air Quality Monitoring Data
Ambient air Pb concentrations are measured by four monitoring networks in the United 
States, all funded in whole or in part by EPA.  These networks provide Pb measurements for 
three different size classes of airborne particulate matter (PM):  total suspended PM (TSP), PM 
less than or equal to 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), and PM less than or equal to 10 μm in diameter 
(PM10).  The networks include the Pb TSP network, the PM2.5 Chemical Speciation Network 
(CSN), the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network, and 
the National Air Toxics Trends Stations (NATTS) network.  The subsections below describe 
each network and the Pb measurements made at these sites. 
In addition to these four networks, various organizations have operated other sampling 
sites yielding data on ambient air concentrations of Pb, often for limited periods and/or for 
primary purposes other than quantification of Pb itself.  Most of these data are accessible via 
EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS):  http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/.  In an effort to gather as 
much air toxics data, including Pb, into one database, the EPA and State and Territorial Air 
Pollution Program Administrators and the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials 
(STAPPA/ALAPCO) created the Air Toxics Data Archive.  The Air Toxics Data Archive can be 
accessed at:  http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/atda/.
2.1.1 Ambient Pb Measurement Methods
A number of methods are used to collect Pb and measure Pb concentrations in the 
atmosphere.  Most methods use similar sample collection approaches.  Ambient air is drawn 
through an inlet for a predetermined amount of time (typically 24 hours) and the PM is collected 
on a suitable filter media.  After the sample has been collected, the filter may be used to 
determine the mass of PM collected prior to then being used for determination of Pb.  The filter 
is chemically extracted and analyzed to determine the Pb concentration in the particulate 
material.  The concentration of Pb found in the atmosphere, in µg/m3, is calculated based on the 
concentration of Pb in the volume extracted, the size of the collection filter, and the volume of 
air drawn through the filter.

The primary factors affecting the measurements made are the sampling frequency, 
duration of sampling, type of inlet used, volume of air sampled, and the method of analyzing the 
filter for Pb content.  The following paragraphs describe how these factors affect the Pb 
measurements.
2.1.2 Inlet Design 
In ambient air monitors, a number of inlet designs have been developed that allow certain 
particle size ranges to be sampled.  The inlets use either impaction or cyclone techniques to 
remove particles larger than a certain size (the size cutpoint) from the sample stream. Three 
particle size cutpoints are used in ambient Pb measurements including TSP, PM2.5, PM10.  The 
TSP inlet is designed to allow as much suspended particulate into the sampling device as 
possible while protecting against precipitation and direct deposition on to the filter (nominally 25 
to 45 micrometers) (USEPA, 2004c).
Sampling systems employing inlets other than the TSP inlet will not collect Pb contained 
in the PM larger than the size cutpoint.  Therefore, they do not provide an estimate of the total Pb 
in the ambient air.  This is particularly important near sources which may emit Pb in the larger 
PM size fractions (e.g., fugitive dust from materials handling and storage). 
2.1.3 Volume of Air Sampled
The amount of Pb collected is directly proportional to the volume of air sampled.  Two 
different sampler types have evolved for PM and Pb sampling – a high-volume and a low-
volume sampler.  High-volume samplers draw between 70 and 100 m3/hr of air through an 8 inch 
by 10 inch filter (0.05 m2 filter area).  Low-volume samplers typically draw 1 m3/hr through a 47 
mm diameter filter (0.002 m2 filter area).  Currently all Federal Reference Method (FRM) and 
Federal Equivalence Method (FEM) for Pb-TSP are based on high-volume samplers.
2.1.4 Sampling Frequency 
The frequency of Pb sampling used in the U.S. varies between one sample every day (1 in 
1 sampling) to the more common frequency of one sample every 6 days (1 in 6 sampling).  Semi-
continuous methods for the measurement of ambient metals (including Pb) are currently being 
explored which would allow for more frequent sampling (as frequent as 1 sample per hour), but 
much more work is needed on these methods before they can be deployed in a network setting.
More frequent sampling reduces the uncertainty in estimates of quarterly or annual 
averages associated with temporal variations in ambient concentrations.  However, the costs of 
sampling and analysis are directly tied to sample frequency.  As such, it is necessary to evaluate 
the reduction in measurement error versus the increase in sampling and analysis costs when 
selecting the required sampling frequency.  A discussion of the observed temporal variation of 
Pb measurements is given later in this section.
2-3
2.1.5 Sample Analysis
After the samples have been collected on filters and the filters have been weighed, the 
filters are analyzed for Pb content.  A number of analytical methods can be used to analyze the 
filters for Pb content including x-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), proton-induced x-ray 
emission (PIXE), neutron activation analysis (NAA), atomic absorption (AA), or inductively-
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) (CD, pp. 2-80 to 2-81).  A detailed discussion of 
these methods was given in the 1986 CD (USEPA, 1986), and the reader is referred to that 
document for more information on these analytical methods.  A search conducted on the AQS 
database18 shows that the method detection limits for all of these analytical methods (coupled 
with the sampling methods) are very low, ranging from 0.01 μg/m3 to as low as 0.00001 µg/m3, 
and are more than adequate for determining compliance with the current NAAQS.
2.1.6 Pb-TSP
This network is comprised of state and locally managed Pb monitoring stations which 
measure Pb in TSP, i.e., particles up to 25 to 45 microns.  These stations use samplers and 
laboratory analysis methods which have either FRM or FEM status.  The FRM and FEM method 
descriptions can be found in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Section 40 part 50, Appendix 
G.  Sampling is conducted for 24-hour periods, with a typical sampling schedule of 1 in 6 days.  
Some monitoring agencies “composite” samples by analyzing several consecutive samples 
together to save costs and/or increase detection limits.
2.1.7 Monitor Locations
The locations of Pb-TSP sites in operation between 2003 and 2005 are shown in Figure 
2-1.  The state and local agencies which operate these sites report the data to EPA’s AQS where 
they are accessible via several web-based tools.  EPA’s series of annual air quality trends reports 
have used data from this network to quantify trends in ambient air Pb concentrations.  The most 
recent Trends report for Pb-TSP can be found at http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/lead.html.
A review of the Pb-TSP network's coverage of the highest Pb emitting sources (as 
identified in the current version of the 2002 NEI) was conducted as part of preparing this 
document.  This review indicates that many of the highest Pb emitting sources in the 2002 NEI 
do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors.  This review indicates that only 2 of 26 facilities (both Pb 
smelters19) identified as emitting greater than 5 tpy have a Pb-TSP monitor within 1 mile.  The 
lack of monitors near large sources indicates we are likely currently underestimating the extent 
of occurrences of relatively higher Pb concentrations.  Additionally, none of the 189 Pb-TSP are 
located within a mile of airports identified in the NEI as an airport where piston-engine aircraft 
operate (i.e., aircraft that still use leaded aviation fuel).  However, there are historical data for 12 
Pb-TSP monitoring sites operating within 1 mile of such airports (going back to 1993).  Nine of 
  
18 EPA’s AQS can be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/
19 Primary and secondary smelters were the source types given particular priority at the time of the last Pb NAAQS 
review (USEPA, 1990; USEPA, 1991).

these sites reported maximum quarterly mean values (for 1993-2002) that ranged from 0.03 to 
0.06 µg/m3 and across all 12 sites, the maximum quarterly mean values ranged from 0.004 to 
0.15 µg/m3.  
Figure 2-1.
Pb-TSP MONITORING SITES:  2003-2005
The number of sites in the Pb-TSP network has decreased significantly since the 1980s.  
The number of sites in the network reached its highest point in 1981 (946 sites).  About 250 
sampling sites operated during 2005.  This decline in the number of Pb-TSP sites is attributable 
to the dramatic decrease in Pb concentrations observed since the 1980s and the need to fund new 
monitoring objectives (e.g., PM2.5 and ozone monitoring).  Lead-TSP sites in lower concentration 
areas were shut down to free up resources needed for monitoring of other pollutants such as 
PM2.5 and ozone.
2.2 Air Quality Modeling
As part of the Agency’s national air toxics assessment (NATA) activities, a national scale 
assessment of hazardous air pollutants including Pb compounds has been performed twice over 
the past few years (USEPA 2006c, 2002c, 2001a).  These two assessments included the use of 
the NEI for the years 1996 and 1999, respectively, with atmospheric dispersion modeling to 
2-5
predict associated annual average Pb air concentrations across the country.  A national scale 
assessment is not yet available based on the 2002 NEI.  A number of limitations are associated 
with the 1996 and 1999 ambient concentration estimates and the underlying emissions estimates.
Historical studies show that Gaussian dispersion models, such as ASPEN, typically agree 
with monitoring data within a factor of 2 most of the time.  In the case of Pb in the NATA 
assessment, model estimates at monitor locations were generally lower than the monitor averages 
for Pb, suggesting that the modeling system (i.e., emissions estimates, spatial allocation 
estimates, dispersion modeling) may be systematically underestimating ambient concentrations.  
This may be particularly true for Pb as metals tend to deposit rapidly with distance from the 
source according to their particle size and weight.  The model-to-monitor analysis is described in 
detail at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata1999/99compare.html.  The modeling system 
underestimation may also be due in part to a lack of accounting for emissions re-entrainment 
(these "re-entrained" particles may be observed by the monitors, but they are not accounted for in 
the emissions inventory, and thus would not contribute to the model estimate).  For more details 
on the limitations of the 1999 NATA national scale assessment, see
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata1999/limitations.html.
For more information on Pb modeling, see section 2.4 of the OAQPS Staff Paper for the 
Pb NAAQS.20 For reasons discussed in section 3.1.1, we did not use an air quality model for this 
analysis.
2.3 Sources of Pb Emissions to Ambient Air
The primary data source for this discussion is the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for 
2002 (USEPA, 2007a).  As a result of Clean Air Act requirements, emissions standards 
promulgated for many source categories that have taken effect since 2002 are projected to result 
in much lower emissions at the current time or in the near future.  For a more comprehensive 
discussion of Pb sources, see section 2.2 of the OAQPS Staff Paper for the Pb NAAQS.21
2.3.1 Types of  Pb Sources 
Lead is emitted from a wide variety of source types, some of which are small individually 
but the cumulative emissions of which are large, and some for which the opposite is true.  The 
categories of Pb sources estimated via the 2002 NEI to emit –as a category- more than 5 tons per 
year (tpy) of Pb are listed in Table 2-2.

2.3.1.1   Stationary Sources
The main sources of emissions in the 2002 NEI are comprised primarily of combustion-
related emissions and industrial process-related emissions.  Point source emissions account for 
about 66% of the national Pb emissions in the 2002 NEI.  The point source emissions are roughly 
split between combustion and industrial processes, while mobile, non-road sources (e.g. piston-
engine aircraft using leaded fuel) account for 29%.
Table 2-1 presents emissions estimates for stationary sources grouped into descriptive 
categories.  Presence and relative position of a source category on this list does not necessarily 
provide an indication of the significance of the emissions from individual sources within the 
source category.  A source category, for example, may be composed of many small (i.e., low-
emitting) sources, or of just a few very large (high-emitting) sources.

There are some 13,067 point sources (industrial, commercial or institutional) in the 2002 
NEI, each with one or more processes that emit Pb to the atmosphere.  Most of these sources 
emit less than 0.1 tpy Pb.  There are approximately 1300 point sources of Pb in the NEI with 
estimates of emissions greater than or equal to 0.1 tpy and these point sources, combined, emit 
1058 tpy, or 94% of the Pb point source emissions.  In other words, 94% of Pb point source 
emissions are emitted by the largest 10% of these sources.
Chapter 3 of this RIA discusses our methodology for characterizing the relative 
contributions of stationary point sources (defined in this analysis as sources emitting > 1 ton per 
year of Pb), area nonpoint sources (defined in this analysis as sources emitting less than 1 ton per 
year), and mobile sources.
2.3.1.2 Mobile Sources
Thirty-five years ago, combustion of leaded gasoline was the main contributor of Pb to 
the air. In the early 1970s, EPA set national regulations to gradually reduce the Pb content in 
gasoline. In 1975, unleaded gasoline was introduced for motor vehicles equipped with catalytic 
converters. EPA banned the use of leaded gasoline in highway vehicles after December 1995.  
Currently, tetraethyl lead (TEL) is still added to aviation gasoline (avgas) which is used in most 
piston-engine powered aircraft.  TEL is added to avgas to increase octane, prevent knock22, and 
prevent valve seat recession and subsequent loss of compression for engines without hardened 
valves.  The 2002 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) estimates that lead emissions from the use 
of leaded aviation gasoline (commonly referred to as avgas) are 491 tons; this accounts for 29% 
of the air emission inventory for lead.  These estimates are based on the volume of avgas 
supplied nationally, the concentration of lead in avgas and the retention of some lead in the 
engine and engine oil of these aircraft.  The Department of Energy estimates that about 281 
million gallons of avgas were supplied in the U.S. in 2002.23 In 2006 the volume was about 280 
million gallons. The majority of avgas contains up to 0.56 grams of lead per liter (2.12 grams of 
lead/ gallon); this is referred to as 100 Low Lead (100LL).  There is another grade of 100 octane 
avgas that contains 1.12 grams of lead per liter, but this product is not widely available.  Based 
on newly available information, the retention of lead in the engine and oil of piston-engine 
aircraft was recently revised from a value of 25% which was more related to lead retention in 
  
22 Knocking is the sound produced when some of the unburned fuel in the cylinder ignites spontaneously resulting in 
rapid burning and a precipitous rise in cylinder pressure that creates the characteristic knocking or pinging sound 
(Chevron 2005 available at: http://www.chevronglobalaviation.com/docs/aviation_tech_review.pdf).

light-duty vehicles operating on leaded fuel to 5% retention for piston-engine aircraft.24 Using 
these recently available data on lead retention, EPA now estimates that lead emissions from the 
use of avgas in 2002 were approximately 623 tons or 35% of the national inventory. This 
estimate is based on all leaded avgas used in the U.S. This estimate does not account for the fact 
that some lead is emitted in the local area of an airport facility and some lead is emitted at altitude.  
EPA’s method for estimating airport-specific lead inventories is discussed in detail elsewhere.25  
Lead is also present as a trace contaminant in gasoline and diesel fuel and is a component 
of lubricating oil (CD, pp. 2-45 to 2-48).  Inventory estimates from these sources are not 
currently available.  Additional mobile sources of Pb include brake wear, tire wear, and loss of 
Pb wheel weights (CD, pp. 2-48 to 2-50).  Emission rates for Pb from brake wear have been 
published but inventory estimates have not yet been developed from these data (Schauer et al., 
2006).  Robust estimates of Pb from tire wear and wheel weights are not available.  Currently, Pb 
from combustion of leaded avgas is the only mobile source of Pb included in the 2002 NEI.

CHAPTER 3.  AIR QUALITY ASSESSMENT
This chapter presents the methods used to estimate the air quality impacts of the 
emissions control strategies outlined in Chapter 4 of this document.  To begin, we first describe 
the air quality assessment tool developed by EPA to relate lead emissions to ambient lead 
concentrations.  We then explain how this tool was used to estimate the air quality impacts of 
each hypothetical emissions control strategy. Following this discussion, we summarize the air 
quality impacts of these hypothetical control strategies and indicate where they result in 
attainment with the alternative target NAAQS levels outlined in Chapter 1.  For areas where the 
controls identified in Chapter 4 are insufficient to reach attainment of each alternative, we also 
examine the potential air quality impacts of unidentified controls.
3.1 Methodology
3.1.1 Air Quality Assessment Tool
To assess the air quality impact of the hypothetical emissions controls implemented under 
the proposed NAAQS, EPA would ideally use a detailed air quality model that simulates the 
dispersion and transport of lead to estimate local ambient lead concentrations.  Although models 
with such capabilities are available for pollutants for which EPA frequently conducts air quality 
analyses (e.g., particulate matter and ozone), regional scale models are currently neither available 
nor appropriate for Pb.26 Dispersion, or plume-based models, are recommended for compliance 
with the Pb NAAQS and were used for the Pb NAAQS risk assessment case studies.  However, 
dispersion models are data –intensive and more appropriate for local scale analyses of emissions 
from individual sources.  It was not feasible to conduct such a large-scale data intensive analysis 
for this RIA.  As a result, the simplified analysis developed for this RIA, while distance-
weighting individual source contributions to ambient Pb concentrations, could not account for 
such locally critical variables as meteorology and source stack height.  Instead of using a data-
intensive modeling approach, EPA developed a more simplified air quality assessment tool to 
estimate the air quality impacts of each lead emissions control strategy.  
In general, air quality analyses conducted in support of the current Agency Pb NAAQS 
review focused on the Pb-TSP monitoring sites represented in the Air Quality System (AQS) 
database with sufficient 1-, 2-, or 3-year data records for the years 2003-2005; this database 
encompasses 189 monitoring sites located in 86 distinct counties.  For this particular analysis, we 
concentrated on county maxima monitors exceeding the lowest alternative target NAAQS level 
(0.05 ug/m3).  The identification of the county maxima monitors and subsequent processing 
were based on the alternative NAAQS form of second maximum monthly Pb-TSP average over a 
3-year period (in this case, 2003-2005).27 Specifically, we identified 36 monitors (located in 36 
  
26 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2007c), Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Lead: 
Policy Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information, OAQPS Staff Paper, section 2.4, EPA-452/R-07-013, 
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, RTP, NC.  
27 Monitors / counties were initially selected based on an alternative NAAQS form of  maximum monthly Pb-TSP 
average.   The Agency focus switched to second maximum monthly after considerable effort had already been made 
3-2
counties) which we analyzed with the hereto described air quality assessment tool.  This 
assessment tool employs a source-apportionment approach to estimate the extent to which each 
of the following emissions sources contribute to observed lead concentrations in the proximate 
areas of those 36 monitors:
· Background lead 
· Miscellaneous, re-entrained dust
· Emissions from area non-point sources
· Indirect fugitive emissions from active industrial sites
· Point source emissions28
After allocating a portion of the observed lead concentration for each monitor area to the 
first four categories listed above, the assessment tool apportions the remaining concentration 
among all inventoried point sources within ten kilometers of each monitor location.29 Through 
this process, the tool establishes a point source influence factor that can be used to translate 
changes in the lead emissions of individual point sources to changes in the lead concentration for 
each monitor area.  To apportion the ambient lead concentration for each monitor area to the five 
categories presented above, the air quality assessment tool employs the following approach: 
Step 1: Estimate baseline air quality value. Drawing from the 2003-2005 Pb-TSP 
NAAQS-review database, the air quality assessment tool records the second maximum monthly 
mean ambient lead concentration for the 36 monitor locations where this concentration exceeds  
0.05 ug/m3, the most stringent of the NAAQS alternatives considered in this document.  These 
concentrations, adjusted for the expected implementation of MACT controls implemented after 
2002, PM2.5 NAAQS controls included as part of the illustrative PM2.5 control strategy 
described in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA [insert ref.], and the controls listed in the 2007 Missouri 
Lead SIP revisions, serve as the baseline air quality values for this analysis.30
     
in the RIA assessment.  Although the metric values were switched for the 36 selected monitors and reprocessed 
accordingly, the initial monitor selection was not repeated using the different metric.  Thus, in some isolated 
instances, a monitor utilized in this assessment was not the one with the county highest second maximum monthly 
average (albeit it was the one with the county highest maximum monthly average).
28 For the purposes of this analysis, airports servicing piston-engine aircraft that use leaded aviation gasoline are 
treated as point sources. The volume of avgas produced in the U.S. in 2002 was 6,682 thousand barrels or 
280,644,000 gallons.  This information is provided by the DOE Energy Information Administration.  Fuel 
production volume data obtained from http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mgaupus1A.htm accessed November 
2006.
29 Note that although the air quality assessment tool distinguishes between the portion of the observed lead 
concentration attributable to point source emissions and that attributable to indirect fugitive emissions from active 
point sources, this analysis assumes that the two contributions are directly related, and any reduction in the air 
quality impact of point source emissions would produce a corresponding reduction in the air quality impact of 
indirect fugitive emissions from point sources in that monitor area.  The process used to relate the contributions of 
these two categories is described in further detail below.
30 Note also that to estimate the value of the point source influence factor described above, the air quality assessment 
tool uses lead concentration data from 2003 through 2005 and lead emissions data for 2002.  Ideally, this factor 
would be estimated based on concentration and emissions data for the same time period.
3-3
MACT controls: For most point sources, lead emissions as specified in the 2002 
National Emissions Inventory (NEI) served as the base case emissions for our 2020 analysis; as 
with the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and ozone RIA, no growth factors were applied to the 2002 NEI 
emissions estimates for industrial sources to generate our emissions estimates for 2020.  In 
general, lead emissions from these source categories are trending downward over time due to 
various factors including lack of growth in particular industrial sectors, implementation of 
alternative lower-emitting production practices at facilities, and/or recent regulations coming into 
effect.  However, where possible, we adjusted the 2002 NEI lead emissions values to reflect the 
estimated control efficiency of MACT standards with post-2002 compliance deadlines, because 
the 2002 NEI would not reflect the impact of those controls reasonably anticipated to be in place 
by 2020.
We identified 42 existing MACT rules with post-2002 compliance deadlines that affect 
sources included in this analysis.  Of these, we focused on rules affecting the 20 industries 
responsible for the largest lead emissions according to the 2002 NEI.  Ideally, we would apply 
control efficiency data for each of these rules to the 2002 lead emissions estimates for the 
corresponding emissions sources.  Consulting Federal Register documentation for these rules, as 
well as EPA’s internal MACT rule summary data, we were able to identify control efficiency 
information for just 11 of these rules. The sources affected by these 11 rules, however, represent 
70 percent of the lead emissions from sources affected by MACT rules with post-2002 
compliance deadlines.  For four of these rules, EPA expects no incremental reduction in lead 
emissions.  For two of these rules (integrated iron & steel and pressed & blown glass), the 
control efficiency information that we identified is specific to metal Hazardous Air Pollutants 
(HAPs, e.g., lead).  For the remaining five rules, we obtained information on their overall HAP
control efficiency from the Federal Register and from EPA's internal MACT summary data.  
Table 3-1 summarizes the control efficiencies found for each of the eleven MACT rules with 
available control efficiency data.  Due to the uncertainty that future MACT rules may cover 
sources of Pb emissions, this analysis does not assume the promulgation of future MACT rules.
PM2.5 NAAQS controls: In addition to adjustments for MACT rules, we also adjusted 
the 2002 NEI emissions estimates to account for compliance measures required by the 
September 2006 revision to the PM2.5 NAAQS included as part of the illustrative PM2.5 control 
strategy described in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA. [insert ref.]  Because EPA expects PM emissions 
controls to be implemented at certain of these sources in order to reach attainment with the PM2.5
standard by 2020, we incorporated them into the base case emissions values used in our analysis.

Of the 36 lead monitor areas considered in this RIA, 15 are located in counties predicted 
to be in nonattainment with the revised PM2.5 standard in 2020, as specified in the PM2.5 NAAQS 
RIA.  For 59 point sources in these areas, EPA identified PM controls from the control 
technology database used in the controls and cost analysis for the PM NAAQS RIA.  The 
controls anticipated to be applied consisted of fabric filters (with a 99 percent expected control 
efficiency), upgrades to electrostatic precipitators (67 percent), upgrades to continuous emissions 
monitoring systems (7.7 percent), and the installation of capture hoods vented to a baghouse (85 
percent).  For each source with controls identified in the PM NAAQS RIA, we applied the 
control efficiency for the appropriate control technology to its 2002 NEI emissions to produce 
the new, PM NAAQS-adjusted baseline emissions for that source.  For this analysis, we assume 
that these expected control efficiencies to remain constant throughout the relevant time period.
Step 2: Estimate background lead concentration: EPA estimates that the average 
background lead concentration is so small (0.0005 μg/m3) as to be irrelevant for the purposes of 
this analysis.  Given the resolution of the lead monitoring devices supporting this analysis, the air 
quality assessment tool assumes that background lead concentrations have no measurable 
contribution to violations at the design value monitors.   However, given the nature of the 
conducted analysis for estimating “miscellaneous re-entrained dust” (see Step 3 below), 
background concentrations are, in fact, encompassed in that category.
3-5
Step 3: Estimate the contribution of miscellaneous re-entrained dust.  Although the 
lead emissions constituting the miscellaneous re-entrained dust category are of uncertain origin, 
they are believed to encompass 1) re-entrained dust emitted from past stationary and past mobile 
sources (e.g., leaded gas), including the contribution from transport; and 2) dust emitted from 
demolition, construction, and/or sandblasting activities, and 3) uninventoried mobile-related 
emissions (e.g., from Pb wheel weights, brake wear and trace Pb from gas/diesel and lube oil 
consumption) .  Rather than estimating the site-by-site contribution of miscellaneous re-entrained 
dust, the air quality assessment tool applies a national estimate of the central tendency of the 
contribution of miscellaneous re-entrained dust to ambient lead concentrations.  EPA developed this 
national estimate by evaluating data from ambient TSP monitors with a negligible impact from NEI lead emission 
sources.  For the purposes of this analysis, EPA defines “negligible impact” to mean that NEI point and non-point 
lead-emitting sources, with associated fugitive emissions, have no contribution to the measured ambient lead 
concentration.  Accordingly, EPA judged the ambient lead concentration measured at these TSP monitors to be 
entirely due to miscellaneous re-entrained dust.  
Of the 189 sites included in the 2003-2005 TSP NAAQS-review database, EPA deemed 
90 sites to have negligible impact from active sources based on two criteria: 1) each site was not 
identified as “source oriented” in previous EPA analysis; and 2) each site had cumulative point 
and area non-point emissions of 0.01 tons per year or less within a one-mile radius of the 
monitor.31 As a central tendency of the contribution of miscellaneous, re-entrained dust, EPA 
found the median ambient lead concentration at these sites to be 0.0225 :g/m3.  Although this 
represents the average concentration at the national level, actual concentrations associated with 
miscellaneous re-entrained dust may vary by area. Nevertheless, in general this value typically 
represents a small portion of the baseline concentration at each monitor, as indicated by Figure 3-
1, which illustrates the composition of the baseline lead concentration at the  Fulton County, 
Ohio monitor.
Step 4:  Estimate the contribution of area non-point sources.  A portion of observed 
lead concentrations results from emissions from area non-point sources (e.g., households).  The 
air quality assessment tool estimates the contribution of lead-emitting area non-point sources to 
ambient lead concentrations based on data from the 2002 area non-point lead emission inventory.  
This inventory is generally summarized at the county level, and EPA assumes that each county’s 
area non-point emissions were uniformly distributed within each county.  Based on this 
assumption, the air quality assessment tool also assumes that the extent to which area non-point 
sources contribute to ambient lead concentrations is proportional to the ratio of county-level area 
non-point lead emissions to total county-level lead emissions.  Because this ratio differs by 
county, the area non-point source contribution to ambient lead concentrations also differs for 
each monitor site, but it generally composes a small portion of the overall concentration, as 
illustrated by the Fulton County, Ohio example in Figure 3-1.
  
31 Sites classified as source oriented in previous EPA analysis were identified via a reference list used in EPA 
Trends Report analyses.  This list encompasses 119 sources and was last updated in 2003.

APPORTIONMENT OF THE BASELINE SECOND MAXIMUM MONTHLY MEAN LEAD 
CONCENTRATION AMONG SOURCE CATEGORIES IN FULTON COUNTY, OHIO
Step 5: Estimate the residual concentration after removing the contributions of 
miscellaneous re-entrained dust and area non-point source emissions.  Based on the results 
of the four previous steps, the air quality assessment tool estimates the intermediate remaining 
second maximum monthly mean (hereafter, “residual concentration”) lead concentration by 
subtracting the contributions of miscellaneous re-entrained dust and area non-point source 
emissions from the baseline air quality value.  The residual concentration represents the total 
concentration fraction associated with emissions from inventoried point sources and indirect 
fugitive emissions from industrial sites.  In the case of Fulton County, Ohio, the residual 
concentration is 0.5054 :g/m3, or the baseline concentration of 0.5288 :g/m3 less the 0.0225 
:g/m3 and 0.0009 :g/m3 concentration fractions associated with miscellaneous dust and area 
non-point sources, respectively.
Step 6: Estimate the contribution of indirect fugitive emissions from nearby active 
industrial sites.  The air quality assessment tool attributes the residual concentration derived in 
Step 5 to point source emissions and indirect fugitive emissions from active industrial sites near 
each monitor.32 The latter category is thought to result from materials handling and on-site 
activities that re-entrain previously deposited lead-containing dust.  Unlike area non-point source 
emissions, indirect fugitive emissions are linked to point sources and are not captured in the 2002 
NEI.  Indirect fugitive emissions, however, do not include fugitives associated with industrial 
processes at point sources, as these direct, process-based fugitive emissions are reflected in the 
  
32 Airport emissions are also reflected in the residual concentration.  For the purposes of this analysis, airports are 
treated as point sources, although as discussed further in chapter 4, no controls are applied at airports.

2002 NEI point source inventory.  The contribution of indirect fugitive emissions to observed 
lead concentrations was estimated as follows:  
· First EPA estimated the average share of the residual concentration surrounding 
active industrial sites attributable to indirect fugitive emissions.  
· For each lead monitor, the air quality assessment tool pro-rated this average 
according to the prevalence of emissions from nearby active industrial sites 
relative to the total 10 km radius distance-weighted emissions 
· To estimate the contribution of indirect fugitive emissions to the ambient lead 
concentration for each area, the air quality assessment tool then multiplied the 
residual concentration by this pro-rated percentage.
Additional information on each of these bulleted steps is presented below.
To estimate the extent to which indirect fugitive emissions contribute to ambient lead 
concentrations near active industrial sites, EPA conducted an analysis of nine sites where 
previously active lead-emitting sources had ceased or paused production.  Assuming that 
activities conducive to re-entrainment continue for a short period after production has ceased, 
EPA compared ambient lead concentrations before and after these production stoppages.  After 
subtracting the contribution from un-inventoried miscellaneous dust (as in Step 3 above) and 
from area non-point sources (as in Step 4 above),  EPA found that the average post-stoppage lead 
concentration represented approximately 15 percent of the average pre-stoppage concentration.  
From this analysis, EPA estimated that the contribution of indirect fugitive emissions from active 
industrial sites represents approximately 15 percent of the lead concentration attributable to 
indirect fugitives and point sources combined (i.e., the residual concentration).  
When applying this 15 percent factor to each monitor area, the air quality assessment tool 
makes further site-specific adjustments.  Relative to point source emissions, fugitive emissions 
tend to consist of coarser particles that are emitted closer to the ground and are therefore 
assumed to have a more localized effect on ambient air quality.  Reflecting this consideration, 
the air quality assessment tool pro-rates the 15 percent adjustment factor based on the percentage 
of distance-weighted point source emissions originating from point sources within one mile of 
the monitor, and specifically, the adjustment is only made only in situations where the 
cumulative emissions of such nearby sources are “significant” (i.e., typically where the aggregate 
1 mile radius point emissions are greater than one ton). For each source, the tool calculates 
distance-weighted emissions using the following equation:

where: 
· DWES =  Distance-weighted 2002 NEI emissions for source S,
· ES =  2002 NEI emissions for source S, and
· DS =  Distance between source S and the monitor location.
3-8
For those areas where significant point emissions are present within a one-mile radius of 
the monitor, the air quality assessment tool estimates the contribution to ambient lead 
concentrations from indirect fugitive emissions at each nearby point source by multiplying the 
pro-rated percentage by the residual concentration.  If, for example, 80 percent of a monitor 
area’s distance-weighted point source emissions originated from significant point sources within 
one mile of the monitor, the air quality assessment tool would apply a 12 percent (0.15 * 0.80 = 
0.12) factor to the residual concentration.  For monitor areas with no significant point emissions 
within one mile of the monitor location, the tool assumes that indirect fugitive emissions make 
no contribution to observed ambient lead concentrations.  Thus, the contribution of indirect 
fugitive emissions from inventoried point sources for each monitor area ranges from 0 percent to 
nearly 15 percent of the total contribution of emissions from these sources.  
Step 7: Determine the contribution of each inventoried point source to the ambient 
lead concentration at each monitor. Subtracting the contribution of indirect fugitives 
estimated in Step 6 from the residual concentration estimated in Step 5 yields the portion of the 
ambient lead concentration in each area attributable to inventoried point source emissions.  For 
example, in the Fulton County example depicted in Figure 3-1, the 0.4297 :g/m3 attributable to 
point source emissions represents the difference between the residual concentration of 0.5054 
:g/m3 and the 0.0757 :g/m3 contribution of indirect industrial fugitives.  For each monitor area, 
the air quality assessment tool further apportions this remaining concentration to each point 
source according to its lead emissions as well as its distance from the monitor.  To account for 
the fact that lead emissions closer to the monitor have a greater impact on ambient lead 
concentrations, the tool assumes that each source’s contribution to the concentration is 
proportional to its share of the total distance-weighted point source emissions for the monitor 
area.  [Note that the tool does not contain data sufficient to assess the influence of other factors, 
such as stackheight and local meteorological conditions, that could affect the relative 
contribution of each point source to monitored Pb concentrations.]
To estimate the distance-weighted emissions for each source, the tool uses the formula 
presented in Equation 3-1 above.
After calculating the distance-weighted emissions for each source using Equation 3-1, the 
air quality assessment tool estimates each source’s contribution to the ambient lead concentration 
as follows:

In this analysis, airports were treated as point sources.  Among the 36 monitors in this 
analysis, there are 19 monitors with at least one airport located within ten kilometers of the 
monitor.  This analysis estimates that the contribution of leaded aviation gasoline to lead 
measured at the monitors ranges from 0.00004 to 0.11 :g/m3.  Currently, lead from combustion 
of leaded aviation fuel is allocated to airports in a manner that is likely to overestimate the 
airport-specific inventory for lead provided in the 2002 NEI.  We are improving the method used 
to calculate airport-specific lead emissions from the consumption of leaded aviation gasoline.  
3-10
This new method will be used to provide revised airport-specific lead inventories for this 
analysis in the final RIA.33 Currently, there are 3,410 aviation facilities in the NEI of which, 25 
are included in this analysis due to their proximity to one of the 36 monitors that were identified 
using the criteria described in Section 3.1.  Among the 25 airports in this analysis, lead emission 
estimates for 18 of them are in the 75th percentile for lead emissions from general aviation and 
air taxi facilities in the NEI.  While this analysis includes airports that are considered 
representative of the more active airports servicing piston-engine aircraft, there are currently no 
TSP lead monitors located within one mile of an airport servicing aircraft that operate on leaded 
aviation gasoline.  In addition to the 25 airport facilities within 10km of the monitors in this 
analysis, there are heliport and airport facilities where piston-engine aircraft might operate that 
are not currently in the NEI.  We are evaluating the potential emissions of lead from these 
facilities.  
3.1.2. Using the Air Quality Assessment Tool to Estimate Impacts of Point Source 
Emissions Controls
Through the process described in Chapter 4, we estimated the extent to which point 
source lead emissions could decline under the proposed NAAQS and the alternative standards 
summarized in Chapter 1.34 To estimate the air quality impact of these reductions, we developed 
a five-step process for estimating ambient lead concentrations based on the air quality 
assessment tool described above.  This process is as follows:
1. For each policy scenario, we calculated the distance-weighted lead emissions of 
each point source according to Equation 3-1. 
2. After estimating the distance-weighted emissions of each point source, we 
multiplied each source’s distance-weighted lead emissions by the point source 
influence factor derived in Equation 3-3 to estimate each source’s contribution to 
ambient lead concentrations.  Note that the influence factor for each monitor is 
derived from baseline emissions and concentration data; our analysis assumes that 
this factor would remain constant in the policy case.
3. For each monitor area, we summed the individual point source contributions 
estimated in Step 2 to obtain the total ambient lead concentration attributable to 
inventoried point sources.  
  
33 The full description of the current and new methods for generating airport-specific lead inventories is described in 
the following memo to the docket along with a table comparing the airport-specific inventories using both methods:  
Memo to the Docket from Marion Hoyer 2 April 08 {details on docket # etc}
34 As described in Chapter 4, our analysis did not consider controls on lead emissions from airports.  Therefore, we 
kept lead emissions from airports constant in both the baseline and policy scenarios.
3-11
4. As indicated above, the air quality assessment tool estimates that indirect fugitives 
associated with active industrial sites make up a pro-rated 15 percent of the 
portion of the ambient lead concentration associated with point source and 
indirect fugitive emissions (i.e., the residual concentration).  We applied this 
percentage to the total contribution of point sources in each monitor area to 
estimate the contribution of indirect industrial fugitives to the area's ambient lead 
concentration.35  
5. Holding the contributions from area non-point sources and miscellaneous re-
entrained dust constant between the baseline and policy case, we added these to 
the total contribution from point source and fugitive emissions to yield the new 
estimate for the total ambient lead concentration.
  
35 As stated above, the 15 percent value represents the percentage of the residual concentration attributable to 
indirect fugitive emissions.  Because we use this 15 percent value to derive the indirect fugitive component of the 
residual concentration, it was necessary to convert this 15 percent estimate into a value that could be multiplied by 
the contribution of point source emissions alone to estimate the indirect fugitives fraction of the lead concentration.  
Such a value may be estimated based on the relationship stated above that F=0.15(F+P), where P is the 
concentration associated with point source emissions and F is the contribution associated with re-entrained fugitives.  
Rearranging this equation yields F = (0.15/0.85) *P, or F = P * 17.6 percent.  Thus, while indirect fugitives represent 
between 0 and 15 percent of the total lead fraction associated with indirect fugitives and point source emissions 
combined, they represent between 0 and 17.6 percent of the contribution of point source emissions alone.

CHAPTER 4.  EMISSIONS CONTROL ANALYSIS:  DESIGN AND ANALYTIC 
RESULTS
This chapter documents the illustrative emission control strategy we applied to simulate 
attainment with the revised NAAQS and alternative standard. Section 4.1 describes the approach 
we followed to select cost-effective emissions controls to simulate attainment in each projected 
nonattainment area. Section 4.2 summarizes the emission reductions we simulated in each 
projected nonattainment area based on current knowledge of emissions controls applicable to 
existing sources of lead emissions, while Section 4.3 presents the air quality impacts of these 
emissions reductions..  Section 4.4 discusses the application of additional "unidentified" controls, 
beyond those already known to be available, that we estimate will be necessary to reach 
attainment in certain monitor areas.  Section 4.5 discusses key limitations in the approach we 
used to estimate the optimal control strategies for each standard.
4.1. Estimation of Optimal Emissions Control Strategies
Our analysis of the emissions control measures required to meet the proposed NAAQS 
and alternative standard is limited to controls for point source emissions at active sources 
inventoried in the 2002 NEI.  [Note that while airports are included as point sources in the NEI, 
our analysis considers the impact of emissions from use of leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) at 
airports, but does not consider controls on those emissions as a strategy for NAAQS compliance.  
EPA received a petitioned from Friends of the Earth requesting that the Agency find that aircraft 
lead emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare, and to 
take action to control lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft.  We published a Federal
Register notice discussing the petition and requested comment on specific aspects of the use of 
leaded avgas and potential control of lead emissions from the consumption of avgas.36]  Finally, 
as discussed in Chapter 3, a portion of ambient lead concentrations can also be attributed not to 
point sources but to miscellaneous re-entrained dust and area nonpoint emissions.  Nevertheless, 
this RIA deals only with the application of controls on emissions at active non-aviation point 
sources, including stack emissions and fugitive emissions from industrial processes.  
  
36 The petition requested that EPA find that such emissions cause or contribute to air pollution which may 
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  And, if EPA makes such a finding, the petitioner 
requested that EPA take steps to reduce lead emissions under the authority of the Clean Air Act Section 231  
Approximately 70 different parties commented on the petition and the questions presented in the notice (72 FR 
64570, November 16, 2007). These comments can be found in EPA public docket OAR-2007-0294 (at 
www.regulations.gov). A clear theme in many of the comments was the dependence of much of the current piston-
powered aircraft fleet on leaded avgas either because of engine design, performance demands, or lack of mogas 
availability at airports. However, several comments identified potential near and longer term measures to reduce 
these lead emissions. These potential measures fall into five general categories: (1) Continued work on identifying 
fuel blends or additives which would provide the octane and other performance characteristics needed for a 
transparent fuel replacement, (2) Measures to ensure greater availability of ethanol-free unleaded avgas at airports 
for those aircraft which otherwise could use it, (3) Laboratory and field work to assess the potential to reduce the 
amount of lead now added to current leaded avgas, (4) Add-on engine technology or fuel management technology to 
allow for equivalent engine performance at lower avgas octane ratings and (5) Long-term measures or standards for 
new engines which provide the needed and desired performance characteristics using modified engine designs and 
calibrations on fuels or fuel blends not containing lead.  For more information about the petition, see 
http://www.epa.gov/otaq/aviation.htm.
4-2
To simulate attainment of the four regulatory alternatives considered in all 36 monitor 
areas, we first modeled the most cost-effective application of identified emissions controls in 
each area, using the following three step process:  
1. Specification of baseline emissions for inventoried point sources in each 
nonattainment area.
2. Identification of potential controls for inventoried point sources.
3. Identification of the least cost strategy for using point source controls.
In areas where identified emissions controls were not sufficient to reach attainment with 
one or more of the standards considered, we also simulated the application of unidentified 
emissions controls to inventoried point sources.  Further discussion of the application of 
unidentified controls is presented in Section 4.4.
Step 1: Specification of Baseline Lead Emissions for Inventoried Point Sources. For 
most sources, lead emissions as specified in the 2002 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) served 
as the baseline for our analysis.  As discussed in Chapter 2, we did not apply growth factors to 
the 2002 NEI emissions estimates to predict emissions in 2020 (the analysis year for this RIA) 
because we believe that the number of Pb emitting sources will not increase with population 
growth as assumed in Chapter 5.  We did, however, adjust the 2002 NEI lead emissions values to 
reflect anticipated emissions controls necessary to comply with other regulations that have 
compliance deadlines after 2002, wherever possible.  These adjustments included application of 
MACT for air toxics rules with post 2002 compliance deadlines37, PM controls at sources in 
designated nonattainment areas in the 2006 revisions to the PM2.5 NAAQS as modeled in the 
illustrative control strategy in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA38, and controls planned for the Doe Run 
Herculaneum lead smelter as part of the 2007 Missouri lead SIP (at the one current 
nonattainment area for ambient lead under the Federal CAA).39 After applying these adjustments 
to all affected point sources, the remaining lead emissions served as our baseline for the 
application of identified controls.  Table 4-1 illustrates the process used to specify the baseline 
lead emissions for inventoried point sources in the analysis.
  
37 The MACT standards included covered the following industries: Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing, Iron 
and Steel Foundries, Petroleum Refineries, Secondary Aluminum Production, Industrial/Commercial/Institutional 
Boilers & Heaters – Coal, Lime Manufacturing, Pressed and Blown Glass and Glassware Manufacturing, Primary 
Nonferrous Metals – Zinc, Cadmium, and Beryllium, Secondary Nonferrous Metals, Primary Copper Smelting, 
Secondary Copper Smelting.

39 This lead SIP was finalized by EPA on April 14, 2006  with a requirement that this SIP will provide attainment 
with the current lead standard by April 7, 2008.  The SIP is available at:

Final Baseline: 2002 NEI Emissions with MACT, PM NAAQS, and Herculaneum 
SIP controls
132.5 tpy
Following the same process as described above, we also specified baseline PM10 and 
PM2.5 emissions for all inventoried point sources.  Although the non-lead fraction of PM 
emissions did not play a role in simulating attainment with the lead NAAQS and alternative 
standard, we did use these baseline values to estimate the ancillary benefits of co-controlling PM 
emissions in the process of implementing lead control strategies, as discussed in Chapter 5.  
Recent promulgation of mobile source rules that reduce PM is not relevant for this analysis.
Step 2: Identification of Potential Controls for Point Sources in each Nonattainment 
Area.  To identify point source lead emissions controls for our analysis, we collected 
information on PM control technologies, assuming that the control efficiency for PM would also 
apply to lead emissions.  We collected this information in the following way:  
1. We queried EPA's AirControlNET database for information on potential PM 
controls available for each source, accounting for any control measures already in 
place, according to the 2002 NEI.40  
2. For sources with Standard Industrial Classifications (SICs) but without identified 
NEI Source Classification Codes (SCCs), we used the SIC/SCC crosswalk in 
Appendix C of AirControlNET’s Documentation Report to identify SCCs for 
those sources.41 We then found controls in AirControlNET’s database associated 
with these SCCs. 
3. EPA identified additional controls from New Source Performance Standards and 
operating permits that apply to facilities with similar SCC codes as the point 
sources in our analysis.  
Completion of the procedure outlined above yielded identified controls for about 28 
percent of the total inventoried point sources in our analysis.  However, because of the skewed 
distribution of lead emissions in the 2002 NEI (the top 10 percent of inventoried point sources 
  
40 Documentation Available at http://www.epa.gov/ttnecas1/models/DocumentationReport.pdf.  AirControlNET’s 
database of PM controls normally excludes sources emitting fewer than 10 tons/year of PM10.  Because many of the 
point sources included in our analysis fall below this threshold and because this analysis focuses entirely on 
obtaining emission reductions from point sources,  we effectively reduced the threshold from 10 tons/year to zero in 
order to identify controls for a larger number of inventoried point sources.

account for over 98 percent of total lead emissions), these sources accounted for more than 75 
percent of total lead emissions, as shown in Table 4-2.  
Table 4-2.
PROFILE OF INVENTORIED POINT SOURCES, WITH AND WITHOUT IDENTIFIED CONTROLS

Sources without Identified Controls 1,634 71.8% 32.1 24.2%
Total 2,276 100.0% 132.5 100.0%
Controls identified through this process include major emissions controls, such as fabric 
filters, impingement-plate scrubbers, and electrostatic precipitators; and minor controls, such as 
increased monitoring frequency, upgrades to continuous emissions monitors, and diesel 
particulate filters.  For each identified control, we identified both the expected control efficiency 
for the technology and the annualized cost of installing and operating the control.42 For those 
point sources where the 2002 NEI indicated that control measures were already in place, we 
estimated the effective emissions control efficiency for each identified control by estimating the 
emissions reductions that would result if the pre-existing control were replaced by the identified 
control technology.  Thus, while a fabric filter might have an expected control efficiency of 90 
percent when installed in the absence of pre-existing controls, for example, if it were applied at a 
source that already had an electrostatic precipitator with an 80 percent control efficiency, the 
effective control efficiency of the Fabric Filter would be 50 percent.43 We also assumed that 
each identified control technology would be installed in addition to any controls required under 
the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS and any MACT rules with enforcement dates after 2002, but before 
2020.  We therefore applied each control’s effective control efficiency to the adjusted baseline 
lead emissions at each inventoried point source.44
Step 3: Identification of the Optimal Strategy for Using Point Source Controls to 
Reach Attainment in Each Area. To identify the least-cost approach for reaching attainment in 
each area, EPA developed a linear programming optimization model that systematically 
evaluates the air quality and cost information discussed below and in Chapter 6 to find the 
optimal control strategy for each area.  The optimization model first identifies the measures that 
each source would implement if it were controlled as part of a local lead attainment strategy.  
Based on these controls, the optimization model then identifies sources to control such that each 
area would reach attainment at the least aggregate cost possible for the area.  Minimizing total 
  
42 See Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of how annualized control costs were estimated.
43 With the electrostatic precipitator, 20 percent of the source’s original, uncontrolled emissions would remain 
uncontrolled, but with the fabric filter, only 10 percent of the source’s original emissions would remain 
uncontrolled.  Thus, replacing the electrostatic precipitator with the fabric filter would represent a 50 percent (10/20 
= 0.5) decrease in uncontrolled emissions.  For the purpose of estimating costs, EPA counted the full replacement 
cost.
44 The one exception to this assumption is the installation of capture hoods vented to baghouses, a control included 
at some sites as part of the control strategies applied for the  2006 PM2.5 revised NAAQS RIA.  Because baghouses 
are major controls which would be replaced by the installation of any other major control, we applied the effective 
control efficiency of major controls to the unadjusted baseline emissions at any site with a capture hood installed.  
For the purpose of estimating costs, EPA counted the full replacement cost.
4-5
costs is not always equivalent to minimizing marginal costs, as described in greater detail below.  
Therefore, although the model selects major controls for each source by minimizing the marginal 
cost/ton of lead controlled at the source, the objective at the nonattainment area level is to 
minimize total costs to reach attainment.
Rather than considering all emissions controls at every inventoried point source, the 
optimization model utilizes a three-stage filtering process to select only the most cost-effective 
controls at sources making a significant impact on ambient air quality.  The stages are as follows: 
1. Stage 1 filter: First, the model selects all controls at sources deemed “relevant” 
by virtue of the fact that they account for at least 0.001 percent of all point source 
contributions to the ambient lead concentration in their monitor area.  This stage 
mostly affects monitor areas with large numbers of inventoried point sources, 
such as Los Angeles, where 156 out of 266 inventoried sources do not meet the 
0.001 percent threshold.  
2. Stage 2 filter: Because we identified multiple major emissions controls for many 
sources, the second stage of the model assumes that the most cost-effective major 
control for each relevant source would be installed, as determined by cost/ton of 
lead emissions reduced.  For example, consider a source that could install either 
an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) that would reduce lead emissions by 0.1 
tons/year with an annualized cost of $1 million or a fabric filter that would reduce 
lead emissions by 0.11 tons/year at a cost of $2 million/year. Because the cost/ton 
is lower for the ESP, the optimization model assumes that the source would 
(potentially) install the ESP rather than the fabric filter.45 Unlike major controls, 
all minor controls identified can be implemented in conjunction with other 
controls, so the model selects all minor controls as well.  
3. Stage 3 filter: In the third and final stage, we remove from consideration all 
controls with a cost/ton higher than the 98th percentile of control costs at large 
emission sources, through a process described in Section 4.4.2 below.  This will 
in effect sweep in more sources that are assumed to control lead emission than 
those identified in Stages 1 and 2. 
After selecting the most cost-effective emissions controls at all relevant point sources for 
each monitor area, the model then proceeds to evaluate every possible combination of control 
technologies until the monitor area reaches attainment with the selected NAAQS or alternative 
standard at the lowest possible cost.  If the monitor area is already in attainment with the selected 
standard, the model applies no controls.  On the other hand, if the monitor area is unable to reach 
attainment with the selected standard when all cost-effective controls at relevant sources are 
applied, then the model is re-run without a lower threshold on source contribution to ambient Pb 
concentration (i.e. the model eliminates the stage 1 filter described above and thus sweeps in 
smaller sources).  
  
45 If there are two available control options, the least-cost approach chooses the option with a lower cost/ton.  It does 
this even if a slightly more expensive control option can achieve greater emission reduction.  It is unlikely that a 
large amount of potential emission reduction is missed by this approximation, because the control efficiencies of 
major controls do not differ significantly.
4-6
As indicated above, this approach is not the equivalent of moving up the marginal 
abatement cost curve for lead.  If the control strategy were selected based on the marginal 
cost/μg/m3 reduced, we would not necessarily identify the least-cost strategy for attainment in 
each area.  
4.2. Lead Emissions Reductions Achieved with each Control Strategy
Utilizing the optimization model described above, we determined the most cost-effective 
control strategies required to meet attainment at the largest number of monitor areas.46 Table 4-3 
presents the lead emissions reductions realized at each monitor area under the control strategies 
followed for each standard. 
  
46 As will be discussed below, the application of identified controls was insufficient to bring all monitor areas into 
compliance with the proposed NAAQS and the alternative standard.

** Total values do not equal the sum of emissions and reductions values for each monitor area, as some sources are 
within 10 kilometers of two monitors, and therefore the single emissions reduction is counted in each relevant 
monitor area.  Note also that total lead emissions values do not represent nationwide totals, but rather the total 
baseline emissions at the 36 potential nonattainment areas considered in this analysis.

4.3. Impacts Using Identified Controls
Following the steps described in Section 2.1.2, we estimated the overall change in 
ambient air quality achieved as a result of each of the control strategies identified in the 
AirControlNET based emissions analysis.  Table 4-4 presents a detailed breakdown of the 
estimated ambient lead concentrations in 2020 at each of the 36 monitor sites under the four 
alternative standards described in Chapter 1.
· According to the data presented in Table 4-4, 20 of the 36 monitor areas are 
expected to reach attainment with any target NAAQS in the proposed  range of 
0.10 to 0.30 ug/m3 following implementation of the controls identified in the 
AirControlNET analysis (i.e., identified controls).  For some areas, however, 
identified controls are not sufficient to reach attainment with one or more of the 
target alternatives in the proposed range.  For the alternative of 0.05 ug/m3, only 
10 of the 36 monitors are able to reach attainment from application of identified 
controls.
· The failure of certain areas to reach attainment with identified controls partially 
reflects the lack of control information for point sources in these areas.  As 
indicated in Table 4-5, sources for which the AirControlNET analysis identified 
no controls make up a significant portion of the ambient lead concentration in 
many of the areas not projected to reach attainment with the proposed standard.  
For such sources in nonattainment areas, we assume that unidentified controls will 
be applied, as discussed further below.
· Table 4-5 also shows that in the case of the 0.05 ug/m3 target NAAQS, some 
areas fail to reach attainment in our analysis because the fraction of the ambient 
concentration associated with area nonpoint sources and miscellaneous re 
entrained dust exceeds the standard itself.  Therefore, even if point source 
emissions were reduced to zero in these areas, they would not reach attainment.
· The projected nonattainment for some areas reflects the combined effect of the 
two factors described above.

4.4. Unidentified Controls
As discussed above, some monitor areas did not reach attainment with the proposed 
NAAQS or alternative standard through the application of identified controls alone in these 
illustrative control scenarios.  In order to bring these monitor areas into attainment, we simulated 
the application of unidentified emissions controls on “large” emissions sources, defined as those 
sources emitting 0.05 tons/year or more in the 2002 NEI.  Unidentified emission controls are 
hypothetical control technologies yet to be determined..47 We limited our consideration of 
unidentified controls to these sources in order to target facilities that will likely be the focus of 
efforts of local air quality managers to comply with the new NAAQS.  Of the 2,230 point 
sources (excluding airports) in our analysis, 7.8 percent (174 sources) satisfy the 0.05 annual tpy 
(100 pound) or greater criteria, but they account for more than 97 percent of total adjusted 
baseline emissions.
In this section we discuss how we estimated the control efficiency of unidentified 
controls, how we applied these controls to point sources in our analysis, and the emissions 
reductions achieved with these controls.  More in depth discussions of the air quality impacts of 
unidentified controls and the method of estimating the costs of these controls will be presented 
below and in Chapter 6.
4.4.1 Estimating the Control Efficiency for Unidentified Controls
We identified an appropriate central tendency measure of the efficiency of identified 
controls which could be applied to unidentified controls by examining the distribution of the 
control efficiencies of identified controls at large sources, as defined above.  As Figure 4-1 
indicates, the distribution of control efficiencies is bimodal, with a mean at 70.2 percent and a 
median at 95.0 percent.  Based on this distribution, we chose 90 percent as a central tendency 
measure to be applied to the control efficiency of unidentified controls. We assumed that 
unidentified controls would be applied in addition to any identified emissions controls already 
installed at each source, meaning that the 90 percent control efficiency for unidentified controls 
would be applied to the emissions for each source.  For the final RIA, we intend to revisit the 
choice of 90% as a representative control efficiency because of the underlying uncertainties 
associated with unidentified control technologies.
  
47 For the final RIA, we intend to explore finding more identified controls for some of these point sources in order 
to reduce the number of sources to which unidentified controls are applied.  We may find that for a subset of these 
point sources, we would be assuming some level of technological progress in the design of controls.

4.4.2. Applying Unidentified Controls to Large Point Sources
In the process of estimating the cost/ton of unidentified controls, we set a cost cap at the 
98th percentile along the cumulative density function of the per ton costs of identified controls at 
“large” point sources, as shown in Figure 4-2.  With the cost cap set at $32 million, we then 
determined that a nonattainment area would not implement any identified controls with per ton 
costs above this  cost-effectiveness threshold.48 This is a simplifying approach that will be 
refined in the final RIA.  Removing all such controls from our database did not significantly 
impact emissions reductions or air quality impacts of the control strategies required for each 
standard.  
For each standard, we selected all monitor areas that failed to reach attainment and 
applied unidentified controls to large sources until attainment was reached.  We applied an 
additional control efficiency of 90 percent to large sources closest to the monitor in an iterative 
fashion until the minimum lead emissions reductions required for attainment were reached.
  
48 The use of the 98th percentile as a cost cutoff for identified controls is consistent with the method used in EPA's 
Final Ozone NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis, March 2008, available at  http://www.epa.gov/ttnecas1/ria.html

4.4.3. Lead Emissions Reductions Achieved with Unidentified Controls
After applying unidentified controls using the process described above, all monitor areas 
but one reached attainment with the 0.3 :g/m3 proposed standard and the 0.2 :g/m3 proposed 
standard.  For the 0.1 :g/m3 proposed standard, six monitor areas did not reach attainment with 
the application of unidentified controls, either because control efficiencies greater than 90 
percent were required at large sources or because small sources needed to be controlled in order 
to sufficiently reduce ambient lead concentrations.  For the 0.05 :g/m3 alternative standard, 
seventeen monitor areas could not reach attainment with any application of unidentified controls, 
for the reasons given above and because the fraction of the ambient concentration associated 
with area nonpoint sources and miscellaneous re entrained dust at some areas exceeds the 
standard itself, as mentioned in Section 4.3.  Table 4-6 presents the lead emissions reductions 
required to bring the maximum number of monitor areas into attainment with each standard.  
Table 4-7 presents the lead emissions reductions realized for each monitor area using both 
identified and unidentified controls.  Tables 4-8 and 4-9 present the air quality impacts of these 
emissions reductions and summarize the number of areas reaching attainment with the 
application of identified and unidentified controls.

We do not model full attainment for the above monitored counties in bold for various 
reasons.  Only one county does not meet the 0.030 and 0.020 ug/m3 alternative standards.  
Delaware County, IN only has one large point source to control, which was controlled as part of 
our identified and unidentified controls analysis, a reduction of over 4 ug/m3 was achieved.  
With respect to the 0.10 ug/m3 alternative standard five additional counties do not attain.  
Ottawa County, OK has a large lead superfund site, and no point sources in the area.  The 
remaining four counties have sources which have all been controlled through our identified & 
unidentified controls analysis.  We intend to investigate these areas more completely to assess 
local conditions as well as attempt to identify any additional identified controls to achieve 
attainment of these areas for the final RIA.

4.5 Key Limitations
The estimates of emission reductions associated with the control strategies described 
above are subject to important limitations and uncertainties.  We summarize these limitations as 
follows:
· Analysis Only Considers Controls on Point Source Emission Reductions.  
Because the available data are not sufficiently detailed to assess the impact of 
indirect fugitive or area nonpoint source controls, the analysis of air quality 
impacts does not account for the potential implementation of such controls in 
areas where they might be effective.  Although the analysis estimates the impact 
of point source controls on indirect fugitives, it does not consider the impact of 
controlling these emissions directly.  This and the lack of control information for 
4-21
area nonpoint sources may have contributed to our projection of nonattainment in 
some areas.
· Actual State Implementation Plans May Differ from our Simulation:  In order 
to reach attainment with the proposed NAAQS, each state will develop its own 
implementation plan implementing a combination of emissions controls that may 
differ from those simulated in this analysis.  This analysis therefore represents an 
approximation of the emissions reductions that would be required to reach 
attainment and should not be treated as a precise estimate.
· Limited Emissions Controls Considered: Because limited data are available on 
fugitive and area source emissions and the extent to which these emissions 
contribute to ambient lead concentrations, our analysis does not consider fugitive 
and area source controls that may be implemented to comply with the revised 
NAAQS.  Additionally, for this analysis we have not modeled the effect of any 
potential changes in emissions at airports with lead emissions associated with use 
of leaded aviation gasoline.  As discussed above, we were not able to obtain 
emissions control information for a large number of point sources in our analysis.  
Although these sources collectively accounted for less than one fourth of all lead 
emissions considered, many of those sources were located in areas that were not 
able to reach attainment with one or more of the standards using identified 
controls alone.  If more emissions control information were available, it may not 
be necessary to rely on estimated emissions reductions from unidentified point 
sources in order to simulate attainment with the alternative NAAQS.
· Emissions Reduction from Unidentified Controls: In this chapter we report 
emissions reductions from both identified and unidentified emissions controls.  
We have taken care to report these separately, in recognition of the greater 
uncertainty associated with achieving emissions reductions from measures that 
may not be currently in use or known to EPA.  Nonetheless, EPA believes it is 
reasonable to project that, with at least 10 years of lead time before a 2020 
compliance deadline, a large number of existing measures will be adapted to be 
applicable to additional sources, and new measures may be developed that are 
specifically focused on cost-effectively reducing PM emissions with high lead 
content.  Because the current standard is attained in all but a few areas of the 
country, and has been for many years since the phase down of lead in gasoline, it 
is likely that very little effort has been devoted to development of lead emissions 
control technologies except for industries where regulations have been imposed to
reduce lead (e.g., large MWC standard, primary and secondary lead smelter 
MACTs, etc.).  As a result, EPA believes that application of unidentified controls 
is particularly appropriate for compliance with a more stringent lead NAAQS.
· Using the Entire Marginal Cost Curve:  The marginal cost curve for this analysis 
was derived from the costs to the larger sources for which we had identified 
controls.  To estimate the costs of unidentified controls, we chose a constant cost 
equal to the 98th percentile of the marginal cost curve.  We recognize that valuing 
all unidentified tons at the same cost per ton is an oversimplification.  We also 
4-22
recognize that as we add additional levels of control to well-controlled sources to 
capture an ever smaller increment of emissions, the marginal cost of the 
additional emission control generally increases.  In these instances, taking into 
account the entire marginal cost curve may more fully capture the increasing cost.  
Note also that in this analysis, unidentified controls include not only additional 
levels of control for well-controlled sources, but also sources that were not 
matched with known controls.  We do not know whether this second level of 
uncertainty will lead to higher costs per ton.  For the final RIA we intend to 
explore both finding more identified controls, and also finding ways to value 
unidentified controls that do not use a single constant cost per ton.

CHAPTER 5.  BENEFITS ANALYSIS APPROACH AND RESULTS
Synopsis
This chapter describes our initial analysis of the benefits associated with attaining the 
proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead and the alternative 
standards outlined in Chapter 1.49 Benefits estimates will be revised and improved during 
development of the RIA for the final Pb NAAQS.  The estimates outlined in this initial benefits 
analysis indicate that achieving a lower National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for 
lead from its current level of 1.5 μg/m3 maximum quarterly mean to one of the proposed 
alternative second maximum monthly mean values could result in significant reductions in 
adverse health effects due to reduced exposure from lead and fine particles (PM2.5).  We estimate 
a potential increase in intelligence quotient (IQ) points across the population (between 110,000 
and 700,000) with the proposed alternative NAAQS under various assumptions, including 
baseline blood lead levels at 2002 levels.    
This draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) seeks to estimate benefits for the year 2020; 
however this draft represents initial estimates using a 2002 baseline blood lead level, resulting in 
a possible overestimate of benefits in the year 2020.  Prior to completion of the final draft, 
assumptions will be revisited and, to the extent technically feasible, EPA will update the baseline 
to reflect expected effects on blood lead levels from other lead rules and potentially from an 
anticipated decline in population blood lead levels.
This draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides illustrative estimates of the 
incremental costs and monetized human health benefits of attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) 
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) within the current monitoring network50.  
Many of the highest-emitting Pb sources do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors, and it is 
important to note that there may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been 
analyzed in this RIA.  Because of time and data constraints, in this draft RIA, estimates of costs 
and benefits employed different techniques for estimating future air quality. This results in 
benefits estimates that represent full attainment, and cost estimates that do not represent full 
attainment.  These differences will be addressed in the final RIA, and further improvements to 
estimation techniques will be explored.
It should be noted again that overall data limitations are very significant for this analysis. 
One critical area of uncertainty is the limited TSP-Pb monitoring network (discussed in chapter 
2).  Because monitors are present in only 86 counties nationwide, the universe of monitors 
exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very small; only 36 counties above 0.05 ug/m3, 
and only 24 counties exceeding the lowest proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 ug/m3.  Because we 
know that many of the highest-emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP 
monitors (see section 2.1.7), it is likely that there may be many more potential nonattainment 
  
49 Additional analysis of benefits under alternative assumptions is available as a memo in the docket titled: 
Supplemental IQ Gain Calculations Using Two Additional Concentration-Response Functions.
50 There are currently 189 monitors representing 86 counties, but only 36 counties have monitors which exceed 0.05 
ug/m3.
5-2
areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.  We should also emphasize that these benefit
estimates are based on controlling Pb emissions using hypothetical control strategies, assuming 
no technological advances in emission control technology. As noted in the discussion of 
uncertainties below, the benefit and cost methods employed different air quality modeling 
techniques, which resulted in inconsistencies between the two values; that is, for certain standard 
alternatives the benefits and costs were estimated assuming different air quality changes.
As shown in Table 5-1 below, when applying a 3 percent discount rate, these IQ point 
benefits translate into monetary benefits for the least stringent standard alternative (0.5 μg/m3) 
ranging between $1 and $1.4 billion (all values in 2006$).  If blood levels continue to the 
observed decline, benefits could be lower.   For the most stringent standard alternative (0.05 
μg/m3), monetary benefits range from $6.1 to $8.7 billion.  Additional co-control benefits of 
reduced PM emissions are expected to range between $0.2 and $1.3 billion for the least stringent 
standard alternative, up to a range of $1.1 to $8.9 billion for the most stringent standard 
alternative.  Therefore, the combined monetized health benefits from reductions in both lead and 
PM exposures as a result of lowering the current NAAQS range from $1.1 to $2.7 billion for the 
least stringent standard alternative, up to a range of $7.2 to $18 billion for the most stringent 
standard alternative.  
When applying a 7 percent discount rate, the monetary benefits for changes in IQ the 
least stringent standard alternative (0.5 μg/m3) range between $0.1 and $0.2 billion.  For the most 
stringent standard alternative (0.05 μg/m3), monetary benefits of IQ gains range from $0.8 to 
$1.5 billion.  Additional co-control benefits of reduced PM emissions are expected to range 
between $0.1 and $1.1 billion for the least stringent standard alternative, up to a range of $1.0 to 
$8.0 billion for the most stringent standard alternative.  Therefore, the combined monetized 
health benefits from reductions in both lead and PM exposures as a result of lowering the current 
NAAQS range from $0.3 to $1.4 billion for the least stringent standard alternative, up to a range 
of $1.8 and $9.5 billion for the most stringent standard alternative.  
Figures 5-1 and 5-2 below display the health benefits from both lead and PM2.5 exposure 
reductions for each of the four alternative standards using a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate, 
respectively.51 Figures 5-3 and 5-4 below display some examples of the total health benefits 
from both lead and PM2.5 exposure reductions using different input assumptions for each of the 
four alternative standards using a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate, respectively.
  
51 Note that these figures present the lead benefits results that incorporate valuation estimates from Schwartz 
(1994b) and PM co-control benefits using the Pope et al. (2002) epidemiological study and therefore do not 
represent the full range of uncertainty in the expected benefits.

5.1 Introduction
This chapter documents our analysis of health benefits expected to result from achieving 
alternative levels of the lead NAAQS, relative to base case ambient air lead levels.  We first 
describe our approach for estimating and monetizing the health benefits associated with 
reductions of lead in air.  Next, we provide a summary of our results, including an analysis of the 
sensitivity of the benefits model.  We then review our approach to and results from estimating 
benefits from co-control of direct PM2.5 emissions associated with implementing measures 
necessary to achieve alternative levels of the proposed lead NAAQS.  Finally, we discuss the key 
results of the benefits analysis and indicate areas of uncertainty in our approach.  
5.2 Benefits Approach
This section presents our approach for estimating avoided adverse health effects in 
humans resulting from achieving alternative levels of the lead NAAQS, relative to a base case 
ambient air lead level.  We first review the epidemiological evidence concerning potential health 
effects of lead exposure and present the health endpoints we selected for our primary benefits 
estimate.  We then describe our screening-level spreadsheet benefits model, including the data 
used and key assumptions.  Finally, we describe our approach for assigning an economic value to 
the health benefits.
5.2.1 Benefits Scenario
We calculated the economic benefits from annual avoided health effects expected to 
result from achieving alternative levels of the lead NAAQS (the “control scenarios”) in the year 
2020.  We measured benefits in the control scenarios relative to the incidence of health effects 
consistent with ambient lead levels in air expected under the current standard (1.5 μg/m3 
maximum quarterly mean; the “base case”) in 2020. Note that this “base case” reflects emissions 
reductions and ambient air quality improvements that we anticipate will result from 
implementation of other air quality rules, including compliance with all relevant Maximum 
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rules and the recently revised NAAQS for PM2.5.52  
We compared benefits across four alternative second maximum monthly mean NAAQS levels of 
0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 μg/m3.  
5.2.2 Selection of Health Endpoints
Epidemiological researchers have associated lead exposure with adverse health effects in 
numerous studies, as described in the Air Quality Criteria for Lead (USEPA, 2006a; hereafter, 
Lead Criteria Document).  Young children are particularly sensitive to lead exposures; 
neurobehavioral effects of lead exposure in infants and young children (less than 7 years of age) 
have been observed consistently across multiple studies that control for an array of confounding 
factors (USEPA, 2006a). 
  
52 Development of this base case is described further in Chapter 4.

The Criteria Document provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence of 
health and environmental effects of Pb.  With regard to health effects, the Criteria document 
summarizes the evidence as follows (CD, Section 8.4.1):
“…Pb has been shown to exert a broad array of deleterious effects on multiple 
organ systems via widely diverse mechanisms of action. Truly remarkable progress has 
been made during the past several decades with regard to (a) more fully delineating over 
time the wide variety of pathophysiologic effects associated with Pb exposure of human 
population groups and laboratory animals and (b) the characterization of applicable 
exposure durations and dose-response relationships for the induction of the multifaceted 
Pb effects. This progress has been well documented by the previous Pb NAAQS criteria 
reviews carried out by EPA in the late 1970s and during the 1980s, as well as being well 
reflected by previous chapters of this document.
The 1977 Lead AQCD (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1977) that 
provided key scientific bases for the setting in 1978 of the current Pb NAAQS included 
discussion of both:  (a) historical literature accumulated during several preceding decades 
that established Pb encephalopathy and other signs and symptoms of persisting severe 
central and/or peripheral nervous system damage, as well as renal and hepatic damage, 
and anemia as typifying the classic syndrome of acute and/or chronic high-level Pb 
poisoning among human pediatric and /or adult population groups, and (b) evaluation of 
then newly-emerging evidence for more subtle and difficult-to-detect “subclinical” Pb 
effects on IQ, other neurological endpoints, and moderate blood hemoglobin deficits or 
other erythropoietic indicators of heme synthesis impairment, which collectively were 
judged to constitute an array of adverse Pb health effects associated with Pb exposures 
indexed by blood Pb concentrations ranging down to ~30 µg/dL. The next Pb NAAQS 
criteria review during the 1980's, as contained in the 1986 Lead AQCD/Addendum and 
its 1990 Supplement (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1986a, b, 1990) 
documented further rapid advances in Pb health effects research that provided (a) 
increasingly stronger evidence that substantiated still lower fetal and/or postnatal Pb-
exposure levels (indexed by blood-Pb levels extending to as low as 10 to 15 µg/dL or, 
possibly, below) as being associated with slowed physical and neurobehavioral 
development, lower IQ, impaired learning, and/or other indicators of adverse 
neurological impacts and (b) other pathophysiological effects of Pb on cardiovascular 
function, immune system components, calcium and vitamin D metabolism, and other 
selected health endpoints.
Newly available scientific information published since the 1986 Lead 
AQCD/Addendum and the 1990 Supplement, as assessed in previous chapters of this 
document, further expands our understanding of a wide array of Pb-induced health 
effects, underlying mechanisms, and factors that enhance or lessen susceptibility to Pb 
effects. Very importantly, the newly available toxicologic and epidemiologic information, 
as integrated below, includes assessment of new evidence substantiating risks of 
deleterious effects on certain health endpoints being induced by distinctly lower than 
previously demonstrated Pb exposures indexed by blood-Pb levels extending well below 
10 µg/dL in children and/or adults.
5-8
The ensuing subsections [of the CD] provide concise summarization and 
integrative synthesis of the most salient health-related findings and conclusions derived 
from the current criteria assessment.  This includes discussion of new toxicologic and/or 
epidemiologic evidence concerning Pbinduced (a) effects on neurobehavioral 
development and other indicators of nervous system effects; (b) cardiovascular effects; 
(c) heme synthesis effects; (d) renal effects; (e) immune system functions; (f) effects on 
calcium and vitamin D metabolism; (g) inter-relationships to bone and teeth formation 
and demineralization; (h) effects on reproduction and other neuroendocrine effects; and 
(i) genotoxicity and carcinogenic effects.”
The differing evidence and associated strength of the evidence for these different effects 
is described in detail in the Criteria Document.  The evidence with regard to adverse effects on 
plants and animals is also described in the Criteria Document.
Although a number of adverse health effects have been found to be associated with lead 
exposure, this benefits analysis only includes a subset, due to limitations in understanding and 
quantifying the dose-response relationship for some of these health endpoints and the fact that 
for some of these endpoints the science is less certain.  We analyzed only those endpoints with 
sufficient evidence to support a quantified dose-response relationship.  This determination was 
made using the information presented in the Lead Criteria Document, which contains an 
extensive literature review for several health endpoints related to lead exposure.  However, this 
document only included studies published or accepted for publication through December 2005.  
Therefore, we performed supplemental searches in the online search engine PubMed to identify 
studies published between January 2006 and the present (see Appendix A for more information).  
Finally, we reviewed previous EPA lead benefits analyses to identify dose-response relationships 
that have been used previously (USEPA, 1997, 2006b & 2007a).  
Our analysis focuses primarily on children’s health effects due to our use of child-
specific data to convert air quality data to a blood lead level, which is the most common 
biomarker of exposure used in dose-response functions.  
This human health benefits analysis does not attempt to estimate the changes in lead-
related health effects among adults. Several key data limitations prevented EPA from quantifying 
these important endpoints:
· The available peer reviewed air:blood ratios to estimate adult blood lead changes 
are dated. Previous EPA analysis of the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act 
(USEPA, 1997) utilized air:blood ratios for adults from based on Snee et al. 
(1981), a meta-analysis of  several studies, including Johnson et al..(1976), Fugas 
et al.(1973), and Nordman (1975). While these studies do provide insight into the 
responsiveness of adult blood lead levels to changes in lead concentrations in air, 
the age of these studies suggests that these ratios may not be appropriate for 
application in 2020.  The more-recent peer-reviewed estimates of air:blood ratios 
have been derived for children.Applying these ratios to adults would be 
inappropriate given the important differences between the two populations in their 
ambient exposure to Pb. 
5-9
· There is a lack of current, peer reviewed non-air-related blood lead background 
estimates for adults. Quantification of adult endpoints would require a non-air-
related blood background for adults. CASAC recommends a range of values for 
children in their review of the Lead Risk Assessment.  However, due to 
differences between adults and children in the routes of exposure to lead, it is 
possible that background levels would differ between these two receptor groups.  
Therefore, applying the child-specific non-air-related background blood lead 
levels to adults could mis-estimate the true adult background levels.
· The adult health impact functions relating changes in blood lead to health 
outcomes are dated. Certain adult health impact functions, such as those 
quantifying the relationship between blood lead and diastolic blood pressure 
(Nawrot, 2002) are current. However, the functions relating changes in blood 
pressure to changes in premature mortality, chronic heart disease and stroke were 
each drawn from studies published in the 1970’s; advances in the treatment of 
high blood pressure  suggest that these functions may over-predict of changes in 
these health effects in the current population. One newer study, Schober et al. 
(2006), quantifies the relationship between blood lead and cardiovascular 
mortality. However, according to the Lead Criteria Document, “…until the 
Schober et al. findings are replicated and more fully understood, the Schober et al. 
(2006) estimates for Pb-induced cardiovascular mortality should probably not be 
used for quantitative risk assessment” USEPA, 2006a, page 8-89.
Taken together, these data limitations make a credible quantified assessment of adult 
endpoints very challenging and subject to considerable uncertainty. The Agency is working to 
addressing these data limitations so that it may be possible to provide a quantitative estimate of 
the adult endpoints for the next Pb NAAQS review in approximately 5 years. In the final RIA 
EPA will include a more detailed discussion of the types of information and data that would 
improve its ability to provide quantitative health benefit estimates for adults.
Table 5-2 below presents the health effects related to exposure to lead in the air that are 
quantified in this benefits analysis.  In addition, the table includes a list of other endpoints that 
potentially are linked to lead exposure, but which do not have dose-response functions available 
for quantifying benefits.    
As shown in Table 5-2, our primary estimate is based on the effect of IQ loss on lifetime 
earnings.  There are several recent epidemiological analyses that have found potential adverse 
health impacts of blood lead levels on cognitive function (most often measured as changes in IQ) 
in young children under 7 years of age, as described in the Lead Criteria Document.  However, 
as also noted in that document, there has been conflicting evidence as to whether there exists a 
discrete period of neurological vulnerability to lead exposure during childhood.  
For instance, the first three years of life represent the maximal period of lead ingestion as 
well as a period of time when important development of the central nervous system is occurring, 
which suggests that biologically, this could be a vulnerable period (USEPA, 2006a).  In addition, 
there are two major meta-analyses that focused on the association between school age IQ and 
blood lead concentrations at two years of age or average blood lead concentrations up to three 
5-10
years of age (Pocock et al, 1994; Schwartz, 1994a).   However, several recent prospective 
epidemiological studies have found concurrent blood lead level (i.e., blood lead measured at the 
same time as school age IQ) or lifetime average blood lead level (i.e., a mean of blood lead level 
from infancy to measurement of school age IQ) to be more strongly associated with school age 
IQ and other measures of neurodevelopment (Canfield et al., 2003; Dietrich et al, 1993; Tong et 
al. 1996, Wasserman et al., 2000).  In addition, a large, international meta-analysis by Lanphear 
et al. (2005) included four measures of blood lead level: concurrent, peak, lifetime average, and 
early childhood.  The authors found that the concurrent and lifetime blood lead levels were the 
strongest predictors of IQ deficits associated with lead exposure.    
A study by Chen et al. (2005) specifically evaluated whether a window of enhanced 
susceptibility to lead exists. This study examined whether cross-sectional associations observed 
in school age children represent residual effects from two years of age or “new” effects emerging 
among these children (USEPA, 2006a). Chen et al. found that the blood lead metric with the 
strongest association with IQ was concurrent, and this relationship grew stronger with age.  The 
authors did not find any association between peak blood lead level and IQ measured at seven 
years of age.  In addition, a stronger relationship was found between IQ at seven years of age and 
blood lead level at seven years of age compared with blood lead at two years of age.  The Lead 
Criteria Document concluded that “[t]hese results support the idea that lead exposure continues 
to be toxic to children as they reach school age, and do not lend support to the interpretation that 
all damage is done by the time the child reaches two to three years of age” (USEPA, 2006a, page 
6-63).  Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to assume that all children under seven years of 
age in the study area for this analysis will experience some cognitive benefit (i.e., IQ loss 
avoided) from reduced ambient air lead in 2020.  Therefore, we have designed our benefits 
analysis to measure benefits to all children under seven in our study area.

5.3 Benefits Estimation Model
5.3.1 Overview
For this benefits analysis, we created a spreadsheet model to provide a screening-level 
assessment of health benefits occurring as a result of implementing alternative NAAQS levels.  
The model uses various simplifying assumptions and is intended only to provide an approximate, 
preliminary estimate of the potential health benefits.  EPA plans to refine the model as it 
progresses towards a final NAAQS level for lead. 
The model was constructed in Microsoft Excel™ and provides an integrated tool to 
complete five benefits estimation steps: 1) estimate lead in air concentrations for the “base case” 
and “control scenarios”; 2) estimate population exposures to air lead concentrations for each 
scenario; 3) estimate blood lead levels in the population for each scenario; 4) estimate avoided 
cases of health effects due to changes in blood lead levels; and 5) apply an economic unit value 
to each avoided case to calculate total monetized benefits.  These steps and the data inputs 
required are shown in Figure 5-5 and are discussed in further detail below.  
5.3.2 Estimating Lead in Air Concentrations
We used estimates of the second maximum monthly mean lead total suspended particles 
(TSP) for each monitor included in our study to characterize ambient air lead concentrations for 
the “base case” in 2020 (USEPA, 2007b).  These estimates were calculated by adjusting second 
maximum monthly mean lead TSP monitoring values for the years 2003 to 2005 to account for 
emissions reductions due to compliance with MACT requirements and the NAAQS for PM2.5
occurring by 2020 (see Chapter 4 for additional information).  We assumed that under the 
“control scenario,” every monitor would meet the alternative NAAQS in 2020 and therefore, 
assigned the proposed alternative NAAQS level as the second maximum monthly mean to all 
monitors.
The benefits model used estimates of maximum quarterly mean lead concentrations in 
order to calculate avoided cases of health endpoints. This decision was based on a number of 
studies outlined in EPA’s 2007 Staff Paper (USEPA, 2007c; Section 5.5.2), which indicate that 
changes in blood lead levels resulting from changes in air lead concentrations occur within a 
relatively short timeframe (i.e., within a few weeks to months).  This finding is also supported by 
a simulation of changes in urban residential dust lead levels following a change in ambient air 
lead using the hybrid mechanistic empirical model developed for the Lead Risk Assessment. That 
analysis showed that changes in indoor dust lead levels (the primary source of children’s 
exposure) tracked closely with changes in ambient lead air concentrations.  The hybrid model 
developed for the general urban case study suggested that 90% of steady-state impacts will be 
recognized within the three months and take up to one year for a full change to be realized.

Therefore, for the “base case” estimates of lead air concentrations used in the model, we 
estimated the expected maximum quarterly mean air lead concentration in 2020 at each monitor 
based on the second maximum monthly mean values for the “base case.”  This was achieved by 
calculating monitor-specific ratios of the second maximum monthly mean to the maximum 
quarterly mean for the period 2003-2005 and then dividing the second maximum monthly mean 
for the “base case” by this ratio.  
For the “control scenario” we estimated the maximum quarterly mean lead in air 
concentration that would be expected in 2020, based on the second maximum monthly mean 
NAAQS concentration.  As in the “base case,” we used monitor-specific ratios of the second 
maximum monthly means to maximum quarterly means for 2003-2005 and then divided the 
selected NAAQS by this ratio.  
5.3.3 Estimating Population Exposure
The first input to any benefits assessment is the estimated changes in ambient air quality 
expected to result from simulated attainment of a NAAQS. EPA typically relies upon air quality 
modeling to generate these data. For this analysis, time and technical limitations prevented us 
from performing formal air quality modeling.  Instead, EPA employed two alternate approaches 
to approximate the air quality change resulting from attainment of alternate lead NAAQS.  Each 
approach relies upon the lead monitoring network as the basis for subsequent air quality 
estimates.  The first approach, which we employed to generate our primary benefits estimate, 
uses an interpolation method utilized in previous RIA’s to estimate changes in lead 
concentrations in projected non-attainment areas. The second approach, which we utilized as a 
sensitivity analysis, applies a radius of a fixed size around each non-attaining lead monitor and 
estimates a fixed concentration of lead within that radius. We describe the process for using each 
approach below.
5.4 Interpolation Method
This approach applies an interpolation method to generate an air quality surface from 
available lead monitoring data to better represent the spatial heterogeneity of lead concentrations 
in a projected non-attainment area.  It utilizes both the lead monitoring network as well as the 
lead-speciating TSP monitoring network; we added the lead-speciating monitors to increase the 
number of data points available for the interpolation. We interpolated lead concentrations to the 
census tract, rather than census block group, to increase the computational efficiency of the 
model.
To create an air quality surface of ambient lead values we applied the Voronoi 
Neighborhood Averaging (VNA) method.53 The VNA is an inverse-distance-weighting 
technique that interpolates point monitor data to a user-defined grid cell for the purpose of 
  
53 Readers interested in reviewing the technical details of the VNA approach may consult the technical appendices to 
the BenMAP User manual, found at: 
http://www.epa.gov/air/benmap/models/BenMAPTechnicalAppendicesDraftMay2005.pdf
5-14
creating an air quality surface. The VNA approach is well suited for this type of analysis because 
the inverse distance weighting approach can approximate the gradient of ambient lead 
surrounding each monitor. VNA is a well-established technique that EPA has used in 
combination with modeled air quality changes to estimate the air quality change associated with 
full attainment of PM2.5 and Ozone NAAQS (USEPA, 2006c & 2008a).
Figure 5-6 below summarizes how we applied the VNA method in this analysis.
The VNA approach is expected to provide a better representation of the gradient of 
ambient lead around each monitor as compared to the radius approach. For this reason, we 
utilized this approach to generate our primary benefits estimate. However, this validity of this 
method is to some extent contingent upon the availability of a sufficient number of monitors to 
support an interpolation. In certain locations, such as Hillsborough County, FL, there are a 
sufficient number of lead and TSP monitors to generate an interpolation with a pronounced 
gradient around each monitor (see Figure 5-7). The lead and TSP monitoring network in other 
non-attainment areas can in some cases be sparse, and the resulting interpolation does not appear 
to generate a meaningful gradient, such as in Delaware County, IN (see Figure 5-8). To the 
extent that there was a denser lead monitoring network in such locations, the interpolation 
approach would produce a gradient that better represents actual ambient lead concentrations. 
While both the VNA and radius approaches exhibit limitations, we hold more confidence in the 
results of the interpolation approach and so rely upon it as our primary method of simulating air 
quality changes. As a means of acknowledging the limitations to the interpolation method we 
also provide sensitivity estimates using the radius method.

related air quality improvement from the Pb monitors to the Pb-speciating TSP monitors.

5.5 Radius Method
In this approach we focused on the 36 monitors in counties that potentially could be 
designated as non-attainment areas under at least one of these alternative lead NAAQS levels.  
These monitor concentration values likely only apply to the population of people living within 
the vicinity of these monitors, especially if the monitor is oriented near a source of lead 
contamination (e.g., a primary or secondary lead smelter).  As a default, we defined the affected 
population as those individuals living within a 10-kilometer radius around the monitor.  The 10-
kilometer radius is consistent with source-specific modeling in the EPA Lead Risk Assessment
case studies for primary and secondary sources (USEPA, 2007a).  In the absence of detailed air 
quality modeling for the lead sources in the vicinity of each monitor, we assumed in this 
screening-level analysis that the lead concentrations in air measured at each monitor are uniform 
throughout the specified radius.  To develop a conservative upper-bound estimate of lead 
benefits, we assumed the entire population of the county was exposed to the concentration 
measured at the monitor (the geographic extent of a county generally exceeds 10 km).  Also, for 
the 19 source-oriented monitors in our dataset we performed sensitivity analysis using alternate, 
smaller radii of one, two, and five kilometers, since lead air concentrations can in some cases 
display significant gradients with distance from a source-oriented monitor.  For example, second 
maximum monthly mean values measured at monitors in close proximity to the Herculaneum, 
MO lead smelter drop off 40 percent within roughly 1 km of the source and decrease by an 
additional 95 percent within 2 km.54  
We used ArcGIS to establish the radii around each monitor.  Our spatial dataset 
contained US Census population data at the block group level for the year 2000.  We calculated 
the total population within each radius in 2000 by adding the population of each Census block 
group that resided completely within the radius and the relative fraction of the population of 
block groups only partially falling within the radius, assuming that the population was uniformly 
distributed throughout the block group.55 For instance, if 50 percent of the block group was 
located inside the radius, we added 50 percent of its population to the total population of that 
radius.
We next took the estimate of the total population for each radius in 2000 and distributed 
it into gender- and age-specific groups (in five-year increments, consistent with the age ranges 
reported by the Census) according to the county-level Census data for the county in which the 
monitor resides.56 In a few instances where a radius extended into a neighboring county, we 
assumed the age and gender-specific proportions would be the same as the county in which the 
monitor resides.
  
54 This was assessed using second maximum monthly mean monitoring data between 2003-2005 for eight monitors 
located near the Herculaneum Lead Smelter (operated by the Doe Run Company) (USEPA, 2007b). 
55 In two instances, the radius drawn around one monitor overlapped with the radius drawn around another monitor.  
The first case affected monitors located in Adams and Denver counties in Colorado and the second affected 
monitors located in Madison and St. Claire counties in Illinois.  We assigned the highest measured concentration at 
the two monitors to the population residing in the overlapping area.
56 The five-year age groups were 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, … up to 85 and above.
5-19
5.6 Population Projections
For both the interpolation and radius methods, we extrapolated the 2000 age- and gender-
specific population data to 2020, using Woods and Poole county-level projection data (Woods 
and Poole, 2001).  We calculated a growth rate for each gender and age group combination by 
taking the ratio of the 2020 estimate from Woods and Poole to the corresponding 2000 county-
level estimates from the Census.  We applied the calculated growth rates to each gender and age 
group to estimate the total population in 2020 residing within each census tract or radius.  This 
approach to population projection is consistent with previous EPA RIA’s that estimate future-
year human health benefits (USEPA 2006c, 2007c, 2008a). However EPA does not assume that 
the number of Pb emitting sources will grow correspondingly with the population growth as 
discussed in the Chapter 4.
In order to determine the number of children aged six and under, we added the population 
of children in the 0-4 age group for both genders and then added two-fifths of the population in 
the 5-9 age group, assuming the population was uniformly distributed across all five ages in that 
group.  
5.7 Estimating Blood Lead Levels
The concentration-response functions we employ in this benefits analysis require 
estimates of blood lead levels in the exposed population to calculate avoided incidence of 
adverse health effects.  We chose to develop a first approximation of the blood lead levels 
associated with reductions in air lead concentrations for each of the alternative NAAQS by using 
the air lead to blood lead ratio (“air:blood ratio”) approach applied by EPA in deriving the 
current NAAQS in 1978 (43 FR 46246).  These ratios predict geometric blood lead levels due to 
direct lead exposure via inhalation as well as indirect exposures via ingestion of dust and soils 
contaminated by lead deposition, based on comparisons of historical data on lead in ambient air 
and measured or modeled geometric mean blood lead levels in an exposed population.  Table 5-3 
lists the ratios considered for the current NAAQS analysis; for its primary estimate, EPA chose a 
ratio of 1:5 μg/m3 to μg/dl.  That is, for every one microgram per cubic meter reduction in air 
lead, EPA assumed that geometric mean blood lead levels would be reduced by five micrograms 
per deciliter.  We selected this value based on advice from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory 
Committee (CASAC) and analysis conducted as part of EPA’s Lead Risk Assessment (USEPA,
2007a & 2007d).    
CASAC in its March 2007 review of EPA's Lead Risk Assessment recommended that 
EPA apply these ratios as part of a population level lead risk analysis to inform alternative 
proposals for a new lead NAAQS (USEPA, 2007d; see Appendix D). In its previous NAAQS 
analysis, EPA used a ratio of 1:2 μg/m3 to μg/dl; however, CASAC suggested that ratios higher 
than 1:2 may be appropriate based on more recent literature.  CASAC cites the use of a ratio of 
1:5 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 to better account for lead deposition from 
air to dust and soil, and they cite a ratio of 1:9-1:10 based on the data in Schwartz and Pitcher 
(1989) on blood lead changes resulting from the phase-out of lead in gasoline. This ratio is not 
5-20
considered further in this analysis due to the differences between that analysis and this RIA in 
the exposure environment considered. 
As part of its Lead Risk Assessment, EPA calculated air:blood ratios based on the 
extensive modeling conducted for its case studies and compared these ratios to values reported in 
the literature (USEPA, 2007a).  For the benefits analysis, we focused on the ratios in Table 5-7 
of the Lead Risk Assessment that compare the incremental reduction in air concentrations 
required to meet lower alternative NAAQS levels to the corresponding incremental change in 
blood lead.    The ratios for the general urban and primary lead smelter case studies range from 
1:2 to 1:6 for scenarios ranging from the current NAAQS to an alternative NAAQS of 0.05 
mg/m3 maximum monthly mean.  EPA found these values to be similar to ratios available in the 
literature, specifically to ratios reported in a 1984 meta-analysis by Brunekreef (1:3 to 1:6) and to 
values calculated from a more recent 2003 study by Hilts (1:7).  More recently, a study of 
changes in children’s blood Pb levels associated with reduced Pb emissions and associated air 
concentrations near a Pb smelter in Canada (for children through age six in age) reports a ratio of 
1:6 and additional analysis of the data by EPA for the initial time period of the study resulted in a 
ratio of 1:7 (CD, pp. 3-23 to 3-24; Hilts, 2003).57 Ambient air and blood Pb levels associated 
with the Hilts (2003) study range from 1.1 to 0.03 µg/m3, and associated population mean blood 
Pb levels range from 11.5 to 4.7 µg/dL, which are lower than levels associated with the older
studies cited in the 1986 Criteria Document (USEPA, 1986).
We selected as our default estimate a 1:5 air:blood ratio, which represented the ratio for 
the change in the urban case study from current (mean) conditions to an alternative NAAQS of 
0.2 mg/m3 maximum monthly mean. According to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “There 
are a number of sources of uncertainty associated with these model-derived ratios.  The hybrid 
indoor dust Pb model, which is used in estimating indoor dust Pb levels for the urban case 
studies, uses a HUD dataset reflecting housing constructed before 1980 in establishing the 
relationship between dust loading and concentration, which is a key component in the hybrid 
dust model (see Section Attachment G-1 of the Risk Assessment, Volume II). Given this 
application of the HUD dataset, there is the potential that the non-linear relationship between 
indoor dust Pb loading and concentration (which is reflected in the structure of the hybrid dust 
model) could be driven more by the presence of indoor Pb paint than contributions from outdoor 
ambient air Pb. We also note that only recent air pathways were adjusted in modeling the impact 
of ambient air Pb reductions on blood Pb levels in the urban case studies, which could have 
implications for the air-to-blood ratios.” (US EPA, 2008b).
  
57 This study considered changes in ambient air Pb levels and associated blood Pb levels over a five-year period 
which included closure of an older Pb smelter and subsequent opening of a newer facility in 1997 and a temporary 
(3 month) shutdown of all smelting activity in the summer of 2001. The author observed that the air-to-blood ratio 
for children in the area over the full period was approximately 1:6. The author noted limitations in the dataset 
associated with exposures in the second time period, after the temporary shutdown of the facility in 2001, including 
sampling of a different age group at that time and a shorter time period (3 months) at these lower ambient air Pb 
levels prior to collection of blood Pb levels. Consequently, EPA calculated an alternate air-to blood Pb ratio based 
on consideration for ambient air Pb and blood Pb reductions in the first time period (after opening of the new facility 
in 1997).
5-21
For sensitivity analysis, we selected a lower bound of the 1:2 ratio from the previous 
NAAQS and an upper bound of 1:7 as upper bound of the Hilts study-based estimates. 
According to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “…in EPA’s view, the current 
evidence in conjunction with the results and observations drawn from the exposure assessment, 
including related uncertainties, supports consideration of a range of air-to-blood ratios for 
children ranging from 1:3 to 1:7, reflecting multiple air-related pathways beyond simply 
inhalation and the lower air and blood Pb levels pertinent to this review” (US EPA, 2008b)
We divided the maximum quarterly mean lead in air concentrations for each scenario by 
the air:blood ratio to estimate the blood lead level in the population due solely to exposure to 
ambient air.  We then added an estimate of non-air-related background blood lead level (e.g., 
from ingestion of indoor dust or outdoor soil contaminated by lead paint) to calculate the total 
geometric mean blood lead level expected in the population.58 For our estimate of non-air-
related background, we selected the midpoint from a range of values reported by CASAC as 
being most appropriate for children under 7 years of age (USEPA, 2007d).59 We apply this 
estimate of current-year non-air background blood lead for an analysis year of 2020. State and 
federal interventions such as the Renovation and Repair Rule (EPA, 2008c) may reduce future 
non-air blood lead to a level below this estimate. Recognizing that future levels of non-air 
background among exposed populations may be lower than the estimates applied in this analysis, 
EPA is committed to exploring the technical feasibility of projecting background blood lead 
levels for the final RIA.  
The air:blood ratio provided us with an estimate of the geometric mean blood lead level 
across the population of exposed children, which we then used to estimate the magnitude of 
health effects benefits.  We assumed that the blood lead level changes in 2020 estimated in this 
way are a reasonable representation of lifetime average blood lead level for children under seven 
years of age in our study and were used with the selected dose-response functions without further 
adjustment.
  
58 We estimated total blood lead level to be consistent with the epidemiological studies underlying the dose-response 
functions we used for estimating changes in IQ due to changes in lead exposure, which are based on total blood lead 
level.  
59 CASAC provided a range of non-air-related background geometric mean concentrations of 1.0 – 1.4 μg/dl in their 
comments on EPA’s Lead Risk Assessment (USEPA, 2007a).  We selected the midpoint of this range, 1.2 μg/dl, for 
this analysis.

AIR LEAD TO BLOOD LEAD RATIOS
Ratio Source Description
1:2 USEPA, 1978 Air:blood ratio applied in EPA’s previous NAAQS RIA. More recent evidence 
suggests blood lead more sensitive to air concentrations than previously thought, 
particularly at lower exposure levels; thus, a higher ratio may be appropriate for 
changes from current conditions.
1:2 to 1:6 USEPA, 2007a Ratios in Table 5-7 of EPA’s current Lead Risk Assessment (USEPA, 2007a) 
estimated from modeling of exposures in urban areas and areas near lead smelters.  
These ratios compare the incremental reduction in air concentrations required to 
meet lower alternative NAAQS levels to the corresponding incremental change in 
blood lead.  This ratio is likely to provide the best estimate of blood lead 
associated with recent changes in air lead concentrations.  These ratios for the 
general urban and primary lead smelter case studies range from 1:2 to 1:6 for 
scenarios ranging from the current NAAQS to an alternative NAAQS of 0.05 
mg/m3 maximum monthly mean, respectively.
1:5 USEPA, 2007a
WHO, 2005
Ratio applied by WHO to establish current lead Air Quality Guideline for 
Europe. Also reported in Table 5-7 of EPA’s Lead Risk Assessment (USEPA, 
2007a; see above) for the ratio for the change in the urban case study from current 
(mean) conditions to an alternative NAAQS of 0.2 mg/m3 maximum monthly 
mean.  Selected as default air:blood ratio because it represents reasonable central 
estimate of the change from current conditions to a proposed alternative NAAQS 
level.  
1:3 to 1:6 Brunekreef, 1984 Ratios reported in a meta-analysis of surveys of smelters and urban areas.  Based 
on older studies that typically reflect ratios for children with blood lead levels > 
10 mg/dl. 
1:6 to 1:7 Hilts, 200360 Ratio calculated from more recent study of air concentrations and blood lead 
levels for children living near a British Columbia smelter during a period of 
decreasing lead emissions.  Blood lead levels in this study  (4 – 10 mg/dl) are 
lower than in the Brunekreef studies, but still higher than those modeled in EPA’s 
2007 Lead Risk Assessment.
5.8 Estimating Avoided Health Effects
The following section presents the approach we used to quantify the health benefits of 
lead due to reductions in the blood lead levels in the population resulting from lowering the 
NAAQS.  
This analysis estimates the adverse health impact of blood lead levels on changes in IQ in 
young children below seven years of age.  Cognitive effects are thought to strongly relate to a 
child’s future productivity and earning potential (USEPA, 2006b).
  
60 This study considered changes in ambient air Pb levels and associated blood Pb levels over a five-year period 
which included closure of an older Pb smelter and subsequent opening of a newer facility in 1997 and a temporary 
(3 month) shutdown of all smelting activity in the summer of 2001. The author observed that the air-to-blood ratio 
for children in the area over the full period was approximately 1:6. The author noted limitations in the dataset 
associated with exposures in the second time period, after the temporary shutdown of the facility in 2001, including 
sampling of a different age group at that time and a shorter time period (3 months) at these lower ambient air Pb 
levels prior to collection of blood Pb levels. Consequently, EPA calculated an alternate air-to blood Pb ratio based 
on consideration for ambient air Pb and blood Pb reductions in the first time period (after opening of the new facility 
in 1997).
5-23
According to the CDC, “[t]he data demonstrating that no ‘safe’ threshold for blood lead 
levels (BLLs) in young children has been identified” (CDC, 2005; page ix).  Therefore, we did 
not incorporate a threshold in our analysis.  Many epidemiological studies examining the link 
between blood lead level and children’s IQ have found an inverse relationship (i.e., increases in 
blood lead levels are associated with decreases in children’s IQ), with more potent effects 
occurring at lower blood lead levels (e.g., Lanphear et al., 2005; Canfield et al., 2003).   The 
Workgroup of the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that overall, the weight of available 
evidence supports an inverse association between blood lead levels and cognitive function in 
children in the low range of blood lead levels (i.e., below 10 μg/dl) (CDC, 2005).  The CDC 
workgroup document also indicates that, “[a] steeper slope in the dose-response curve was 
observed at lower rather than higher [blood lead levels] BLLs” (page iv of the Appendix).  In 
addition, EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) concluded the following: “by 
comparison to most other environmental toxicants, the degree of uncertainty about the health 
effects of lead is quite low.  It appears that some of these effects, particularly changes in the 
levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children’s neurobehavioral development, may 
occur at blood lead levels so low as to be essentially without a threshold” (USEPA, 2004).
In order to quantify the expected changes in IQ points in the population of children due to 
the implementation of alternative NAAQS, we utilized available dose-response functions in the 
literature.  For our primary estimate, we selected a dose-response relationship from a pooled 
analysis of seven prospective studies in North America and Europe examining the effect of lead 
on full-scale IQ in children (Lanphear et al., 2005).61,62 Blood lead levels were measured in each 
study five times over early childhood (at 6, 12 (or 15), 36, 48, and 60 months).  Full-scale IQ was 
measured when the children were between 4 and 10 years of age.  Four measures of blood lead 
were examined by the authors: concurrent blood lead (defined as the blood lead measured closest 
to the IQ test), maximum blood lead (defined as the peak blood lead measured at any time before 
the IQ test), average lifetime blood lead (defined as the mean blood lead from six months to 
concurrent blood lead tests), and early childhood blood lead (defined as the mean blood lead 
from 6 to 24 months).  The authors found that the concurrent and lifetime blood lead levels were 
the strongest predictors of IQ deficits associated with lead exposure.
We used an estimate from this study based on a log-linear relationship between lifetime 
blood lead level and IQ score.63 The log-linear relationship was found to be the best fit for the 
data and the lifetime blood lead levels exhibited a strong relationship with IQ.  In addition, we 
found this measure to be the most consistent with the benefits scenario (see the section in this 
chapter entitled “Selection of Health Endpoints for further information).  Lanphear reports an IQ 
decrement of 6.2 points for an increase in lifetime blood lead level from 6.1 to 47.0 μg/dl for the 
selected model.  However, the lowest measured lifetime blood lead level represented in the 
Lanphear pooled analysis was 1.47 μg/dl.  To estimate IQ effects at blood lead levels below this 
  
61 Full-scale IQ is a composite score of verbal and performance tests.  Children were administered a version of the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children under uniform conditions within each study (Lanphear et al., 2005).
62 The seven cohort studies included in this analysis include sites in Boston, Massachusetts (Bellinger et al., 1992); 
Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio (Dietrich et al., 1993 and Ernhart et al., 1989); Mexico City, Mexico (Schnaas et al., 
2000); Rochester, New York (Canfield et al., 2003); and Yugoslavia (Wasserman et al., 1997).
63 The natural log of the blood lead levels were used for this analysis.
5-24
“cutpoint,” we used a linearized slope, obtained by taking the tangent to the log-linear function at 
the point of departure (USEPA, 2007a).  
To estimate IQ benefits from blood lead reductions, we first calculated the expected IQ 
point loss per child under each of the two scenarios (the “base case” and the “control scenarios”) 
for each monitor (Equation 1).  We then subtracted the “base case” IQ loss from the “control 
scenario” IQ loss and multiplied by the population of children six years of age and younger 
living within the radius of influence of each monitor to estimate the total number of IQ points 
that would be gained by reducing the NAAQS (Equation 2).
Equation 1
For blood lead levels ≥ cutpoint:
IQ loss = β1 ´ ln(PbB/cutpoint) + β2 ´ cutpoint
For blood lead levels < cutpoint:
IQ loss = β2 ´ PbB
Where: 
Cutpoint = 1.47 μg/dl (i.e., the lowest observed lifetime blood lead level);
β1 = -3.04 (log-linear regression coefficient from Lanphear (2005), Table 4);
β2 = -2.1 (linear slope); and
PbB = blood lead level (μg/dl).
Equation 2
Δ IQ = (IQ loss Control – IQ loss Base) ´ P
Where:
Δ IQ = total number of IQ points gained under the “control scenario” in comparison with 
the “base case” in 2020;
IQ loss Control = IQ point loss under the “control scenario” per child;
IQ loss Base = IQ point loss under the “base case” per child; and
P = the population of children aged 0 – 6 within the monitor’s radius of influence.
We also assessed the sensitivity of the IQ benefits to the epidemiological study selected, 
using alternative estimates from a meta-analysis of seven studies (Schwartz, 1993) and a study of 
172 children in Rochester, New York (Canfield et al, 2003).  The Schwartz study calculated an 
5-25
overall estimate by linearizing coefficients from included studies that used natural logarithms of 
lead as the exposure index.  Regression coefficients for studies with untransformed blood lead 
levels were used directly.  The Schwartz analysis found a decrease of 0.25 IQ points per 1 μg/dl 
increase in blood lead level.  Using a linear model between lifetime blood lead level and IQ 
score, Canfield et al. (2003) found a decrement of 0.46 IQ points per 1 μg/dl increase in blood 
lead level.  We used the following equation (Equation 3) for these two linear dose-response 
functions:
Equation 3
Δ IQ = [β ´ (PbB1 – PbB2)] ´ P 
Where:
Δ IQ = total number of IQ points gained under the “control scenario” in comparison with 
the “base case” in 2020;
β = linear regression coefficient (-0.25 for Schwartz and -0.46 for Canfield);
PbB1 = blood lead level under the “control scenario” (μg/dl);
PbB2 = blood lead level under the “base case” (μg/dl); and
P = the population of children aged 0 – 6 within the monitor’s radius of influence.
Table 5-4 below summarizes a range of studies quantifying the relationship between 
changes in blood lead and IQ that was included in the Lead NAAQS NPRM (EPA, 2008b).

5.9 Benefit Valuation
5.9.1 Value Of Avoided IQ Decrements
The valuation approach we apply for assessing monetary losses associated with IQ 
decrements is based on an approach applied in previous EPA analyses (USEPA, 1997, 2005 & 
2006b).  The approach expresses the loss to an affected individual resulting from IQ decrements 
in terms of foregone future earnings for that individual.
To estimate the expected monetary value of these effects, we first estimated the median 
present value of future earnings at time of birth for a person born in the U.S., based on earnings 
and labor force participation rate data from the 2006 Current Population Survey (CPS).64 When 
calculating the lifetime earnings estimate, we assumed an individual born today would begin 
working at age 16 and retire at age 67.  We assumed a real growth rate for wages of one percent 
per year, as assumed in EPA’s Section 812 retrospective analysis (US EPA, 1997); adjusted for 
survival probabilities based on current US vital statistics from the CDC’s National Center for 
Health Statistics;65 and adjusted for labor force participation by age.  We then discounted the 
expected lifetime stream of wages using a three percent annual rate.  As in EPA’s Economic 
Analysis for the Renovation, Repair, and Painting Program Proposed Rule (EPA, 2008c), we 
assumed children will be affected by lead at age three, the midpoint of the range during which 
children are thought to be most susceptible to lead.  Therefore, we discounted lifetime earnings 
back to age three.  We estimated present value median lifetime earnings to be $606,930 in 2006 
dollars.
In the previous EPA analyses cited above, the Agency has applied an average estimate of 
the effect of IQ on earnings of 2.379 percent per IQ point from an analysis by Salkever (1995).66  
An analysis by Schwartz (1994b) estimated that a 1-point increase in IQ would increase earnings 
by 1.76 percent.  The percentage increases in both studies reflect both direct impact of IQ on 
hourly wages and indirect effects on annual earnings as the result of additional schooling and 
increased labor force participation.  A recent review of literature from the labor economics and 
environmental health fields by CDC economist Scott Grosse suggests that both of these studies 
may have overestimated the association of IQ with earnings (2007).  Specifically, he found the 
Salkever estimate of direct impacts of IQ on wages to be higher than estimates reported in the 
labor economics literature.  Grosse also found that the Schwartz study overestimates the 
cognitive impact of lead exposure on earnings, but he argues that the Schwartz estimate may still 
be appropriate for estimating the total effect of lead on earnings, because it includes the effects 
of lead on education and earnings that result from both cognitive and non-cognitive changes.  
Thus, it may be a more comprehensive estimate than one based on cognitive changes alone.  
  
64 See http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm - data.
65 See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_14.pdf.
66 The 812 Retrospective analysis also included an estimate based on older work by Needleman et al. (1990).
5-28
In recognition of the fact that the economics literature continues to evolve, and because 
EPA has traditionally relied upon the Salkever (1995) estimate to value changes in IQ, for this 
analysis we provide a range of valuation estimates based on both the Salkever (1995) and the 
Schwartz (1994b) functions. Below we describe how we estimate the cost per IQ decrement 
using each function.
The 1.76 percent estimate from Schwartz represents a gross impact on earnings; it does 
not account for the costs of additional schooling.  EPA’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) RIA 
(USEPA, 2005) reported an estimate of $16,425 per additional year of schooling in 1992 dollars, 
based on U.S. Department of Education data reflecting both direct annual expenditures per 
student and annual average opportunity cost (i.e., lost income from being in school).  Consistent 
with the CAMR analysis, we assume that these costs are incurred when an individual born today 
turns 19, based on an average 12.9 years of education among people aged 25 and over in the U.S.  
We discount the educational costs back to a present value at age 3, to be consistent with the 
present value of lifetime earnings.  We then adjust this value to 2006 dollars, resulting in an 
estimated $14,700 per additional year of schooling.  Schwartz reports an increase of 0.131 years 
of schooling per IQ point (1994b); thus the change in average education costs per IQ point is 
$14,700 ´ 0.131 = $1,930.
Using the Schwartz function, we calculated the present value of the median net earnings 
loss associated with one IQ point as the present value of median lost earnings per IQ point lost 
($606,930 ´ 0.0176 = $10,682) minus the change in average education costs per IQ point 
($1,930). These calculations yield a value of $8,760 of net earnings lost per a one-point decrease 
in IQ using a 3% discount rate and a value of $1,094 at a 7% discount rate.
To estimate the cost per IQ point using Salkever (1995), we followed the same set of 
steps as above, substituting the Salkever estimate of the change in lifetime earnings. These 
calculations yield a value of $12,512 of net earnings lost per a one point decrease in IQ using a 
3% discount rate and a value of $2,156 at a 7% discount rate.
5.10 Results
This section presents the health effects results and the associated monetary benefits.  We 
first present the expected IQ point gains in 2020, comparing each of the “control scenarios” to 
the “base case.”   We then provide the expected monetized value of those gains in IQ in 2020.  
We also describe an analysis we performed to assess the sensitivity of the model to the various 
inputs used and assumptions made.  Finally, we explain the methodology we applied for 
estimating monetized health benefits from co-control of PM2.5 and the results of that analysis.

Table 5-5 below presents the total number of IQ points expected to be gained in the US in 
the year 2020 by achieving each of the alternate NAAQS level options, when compared to the 
“base case” (i.e., the lead NAAQS remains at its current level).  Our results indicate that the 
number of IQ points gained in 2020 ranges from 110,000 if a 0.5 second maximum monthly 
mean NAAQS is achieved up to 700,000 for a 0.05 second maximum monthly mean NAAQS.  
5-29
These IQ point gains are valued at between $1.0 and $8.7 billion at a 3% discount rate and 
between $0.2 and $1.5 billion at a 7% discount rate (2006$).

** Results reflect the use a 2002 derived non-air background blood lead applied to analysis year of 2020. To the 
extent that state and federal interventions such as the Renovation and Repair Rule (EPA, 2008c) reduce future 
non-air blood lead levels, the estimate of IQ change above may be overstated. 
We also assessed the geographic distribution of these benefits.  We found that the 
benefits were concentrated in a small number of counties.  Table 5-6 below is an example of the 
distribution of total benefits due to IQ points gained for the 0.2 μg/m3 second maximum monthly 
mean NAAQS alternative.  For this standard, approximately 60 percent of the total benefits are 
due to changes in lead air concentrations in three counties: Hillsborough, Florida; Delaware, 
Indiana; and Berks, PA.  Please see Appendix B for tables providing the percentage of total 
health benefits by county for all of the four alternative NAAQS levels.

this table.
5.10.2 IQ Sensitivity Analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis on the benefits model in order to assess the total 
range of potential benefits and to determine the sensitivity of the primary model results to 
various data inputs and assumptions.  We used the model to calculate the total monetary benefits 
due to gains in children’s IQ for the 0.2 second maximum monthly mean NAAQS option using 
our default model input assumptions.67 We then changed each default input one at a time and 
recalculated the total benefits to assess the percent change from the default.  Table 5-7 below 
presents the results of this sensitivity analysis.  The table indicates for each input parameter the 
value used as the default (in bold) and the values for the sensitivity analyses.  It then provides the 
total monetary benefits for each input and the percent change from the default value.  
Our sensitivity analysis results indicate that the benefits model is most sensitive to the 
method used for assigning air lead exposure concentrations to the population of exposed 
children.  Our primary estimate relied on an interpolation method, where several monitor 
concentrations were used in determining the exposure concentration.  When the radius method 
was employed as part of the sensitivity analysis, the results varied.  We assumed that monitor 
concentration applied to the population residing within a 10 km radius as a best estimate of the 
exposed population, which as we noted above, produces a conservative upper-bound estimate of 
  
67 Note that for the sensitivity analysis, we relied on the results that incorporated the valuation estimate for IQ from 
Schwartz (1994b).  
5-31
exposure.  When compared with the interpolation method, this increased results by 31 percent.  
The size of the radius assumed when using the radius method also had a large impact on the 
results.  When the radius size was reduced to 5, 2, and 1 km for monitors associated with a lead 
source, the benefits are significantly reduced (i.e., total monetary benefits are reduced by 66, 94, 
and 98 percent, respectively).  In addition, if the monitor concentration is assumed to apply to the 
population of the entire county in which that monitor resides, the benefits increase significantly 
(323 percent).
The discount rate also had a significant impact on results, because the benefits of lead on 
earnings occur over a lifetime, and the net present value of those earnings is highly sensitive to 
the discount rate applied.  When the discount rate was changed from the default (3 percent) to a 
rate of 7 percent, the benefits fell by 88 percent.

The results were also found to be sensitive to the epidemiological study selected for 
calculating IQ point gains in 2020, with results decreasing by between 54 and 74 percent when

used, as compared to the default function from Lanphear et al. (2005).   
Inputs that had a moderate impact on the benefits results include the air:blood ratio 
selected to convert lead air concentrations into blood lead levels in the population and the non-
air-related geometric mean blood lead level used.
5.11 PM Co-Control Benefits – Methodology and Results
As outlined in Chapter 4, most of the point source measures implemented to achieve the 
NAAQS standards are focused on controlling emissions of lead in particulate form.  As a result, 
virtually all of these measures also have a significant impact on emissions of directly emitted 
particulate matter.  Table 5-8 lists the PM-related health effects that are included in our 
monetized benefits estimate incorporating PM co-benefits.68  
In Chapter 4 we identified control technologies to reduce emissions of lead that also 
reduce PM2.5.  However, in some areas, more emission reductions are needed than can be 
achieved through identified control options (i.e., unidentified controls).  The identified and 
unidentified controls are shown in Table 5-9 below. These emission reduction estimates are 
incremental to a baseline that reflects emission reductions from MACT controls and the PM2.5
NAAQS RIA.

b In addition to primary economic endpoints, there are a number of biological responses that have been associated 
with PM health effects, including morphological changes and altered host defense mechanisms.  The public 
health impact of these biological responses may be partly represented by our quantified endpoints.
c Cohort estimates are designed to examine the effects of long-term exposures to ambient pollution, but relative 
risk estimates may also incorporate some effects due to shorter-term exposures (see Kunzli et al., 20 01).
d While some of the effects of short-term exposure are likely to be captured by the cohort estimates, there may be 
additional premature mortality from short-term PM exposure not captured in the estimates included in the

To estimate the value of these PM2.5 emissions reductions, EPA utilized PM2.5 benefit-
per-ton estimates. These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human 
health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of 
PM2.5 from a specified source. EPA has used a similar technique in previous RIAs, including the 
recent ozone NAAQS RIA (USEPA, 2008a).  The fourteen estimates presented below derive 
from the application of three alternative methods:
· One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed 
from a study of the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort reported in Pope et al. 
(2002), which has previously been reported as the primary estimate in recent 
RIAs (USEPA, 2006c).
· One estimate is based on Laden et al.’s (2006) reporting of the extended Six 
Cities cohort study; this study is a more recent PM epidemiological study that was 
used as an alternative in the PM NAAQS RIA.
5-34
· The other twelve estimates are based on the results of EPA's expert elicitation 
study on the PM-mortality relationship, as first reported in Industrial Economics 
(2006) and interpreted for benefits analysis in EPA's final RIA for the PM 
NAAQS, published in September 2006 (USEPA, 2006c).  For that study, twelve 
experts (labeled A through L) provided independent estimates of the PM-
mortality C-R function.  EPA practice has been to develop independent estimates 
of PM-mortality estimates corresponding to the C-R function provided by each of 
the twelve experts.
Readers interested in reviewing the complete methodology for creating the benefit per-
ton estimates used in this analysis can consult the Technical Support Document (TSD) 
accompanying the recent final ozone NAAQS RIA (USEPA 2008a).69
As described in the documentation for the benefit per-ton estimates cited above, national 
per-ton estimates are developed for selected pollutant/source category combinations.  The per ton 
values calculated therefore apply only to tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source 
combinations (e.g., SO2 emitted from electric generating units; NOx emitted from mobile 
sources).  Emissions controls modeled in this RIA are all applied to point sources; a few are at 
electric generating units (EGUs), but most are at industrial facilities involved in handling lead as 
a manufacturing product, byproduct, or input.  From among the list of pollutant/source 
combinations outlined in the TSD referenced above, the combination most appropriate for 
valuation of PM2.5 emissions reductions from the sources controlled for lead emissions is the 
combination for PM2.5 from EGU and non-EGU point sources.  Estimates of this per-ton value 
for a 3 percent discount rate vary from a low of $67,000 per ton to a high of $560,000 per ton 
(based on a change in emissions of 25 percent or less from a 2015 PM emissions base, in 2006$).  
Our estimate of PM2.5 co-control benefits is therefore based on the total PM2.5 emissions 
controlled multiplied by this per-ton value.  The results of this calculation are provided in Table 
5-10 below.  Figures 5-9 and 5-10 provide a graphical representation of the 14 estimates of PM 
co-control benefits for PM2.5, using both a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate.

EPA-HQ-OAR-2007-0225-0284.

5.12 Discussion
The results of this benefits analysis demonstrate that lowering the current (1.5 μg/m3
maximum quarterly mean) lead NAAQS to one of the proposed alternative NAAQS would be 
expected to have a significant impact on the IQ of young children.  Lowering the standard could 
cause an increase in total IQ points by between 110,000 and 700,000 points in 2020, which 
would be valued at between 1.0 and 8.7 billion 2006$.  In addition, controls installed to achieve 
the lead NAAQS standards will also reduce emissions of fine particulates.  As a result, this 
analysis includes a screening level calculation that indicates each of the alternatives considered 
could have a significant benefit in terms of improved particulate air quality, reduced health 
effects, and increased economic welfare of currently exposed individuals.  
This benefits analysis is intended to be an initial screening investigation to provide a first 
estimate of the potential magnitude of the benefits of reducing the lead NAAQS.  Therefore, the 
results of this analysis are associated with a number of uncertainties.  The benefits of IQ point 
gains in children were very sensitive to the method employed for estimating exposures to the 
population.  When comparing the default method, which involved concentrations that were 
interpolated from multiple monitors, to the method assuming a uniform concentration within a 10 
km radius around an individual monitor, the results increase by 31 percent. Increasing the radius 
to include the entire county in which the monitor resides results in roughly 3-fold increase in 
benefits.  Decreasing the radius size also has a large impact on benefits, decreasing the value by 
as much as 98 percent when a radius of 1 km is used.  The results were also fairly sensitive to the 
discount rate selected.  When a 7 percent discount rate was used in place of the default rate of 3 
percent, results decreased by 88 percent.  This is in part because the benefits of lead on earnings 
occur over a lifetime, and the net present value of those earnings is highly sensitive to the 
discount rate applied.     The dose-response function selected for quantifying the number of IQ 
points gained as a result of achieving the alternative NAAQS levels affected the results.  
Utilizing alternate epidemiological studies decreased the primary estimate by as much as 74 
percent.  However, we believe the Lanphear et al. (2005) study was the best choice for our 
primary estimate.  This study was a meta-analysis that synthesized a range of existing 
information and is based on more recent data than the studies included in the Schwartz (1993) 
study.  In addition, the log-linear model was the most robust estimate from this study, in that it 
was the best fit for the data. 
Additional uncertainties related to the benefits estimates include the following: 
· For our primary estimate of the benefits due to gains in children’s IQ, we used a 
log-linear estimate from a recently published pooled analysis of seven studies 
(Lanphear et al., 2005).  Using alternate estimates from other epidemiological 
studies examining the link between blood lead level and children’s IQ has 
significant impact on benefits results.  We found the benefits to decrease by as 
much as 74 percent when an alternate estimate from a paper by Schwartz (1993) 
is used.  This is due in part to the underlying shape of the dose-response 
relationship assumed by each of the functions.  In the Lanphear study, a log-linear 
relationship was found to be the best fit for the data (i.e., the natural log-
transformed blood lead level is used to predict changes in IQ score).  This model 
implies that the magnitude of changes in IQ increases with lower blood lead 
5-39
levels.  However, in the Schwartz (1993) and Canfield et al. (2003) studies, a 
single linear model is assumed (i.e., untransformed blood lead levels are used to 
predict changes in IQ score).  The single linear model implies that the magnitude 
of change in IQ is constant over the entire range of blood lead levels.  Therefore, 
at lower blood lead levels, the log-linear model predicts larger changes in IQ than 
the linear model.  Note that CASAC, in their review of EPA’s Lead Risk 
Assessment indicated that “studies show that the decrements in intellectual 
(cognitive) functions in children are proportionately greater at PbB concentrations 
<10 μg/dl” (USEPA, 2007d, page 3).  However, if the true dose-response 
relationship is linear, than our primary estimate of benefits is an overestimation. 
· Some uncertainty is involved in the estimates of maximum quarterly mean lead 
air concentrations used for the benefits model.  We used ratios of second 
maximum monthly mean values to maximum quarterly mean values from lead 
monitoring data from 2003-2005 to convert the second maximum monthly mean 
values in 2020 into a maximum quarterly mean for the “base case” as well as to 
convert the alternative second maximum monthly mean NAAQS into a maximum 
quarterly mean for the “control scenarios.”  If the true ratio between the second 
maximum monthly means to the maximum quarterly mean is different in 2020 
than in 2003-2005 because the pattern and distribution of daily values differs, 
then our results could be either over- or underestimated.  
· The interpolation method of estimating exposure concentrations that we used for 
our primary estimate is associated with some uncertainty.  The validity of this 
method is to some extent contingent upon the availability of a sufficient number 
of monitors to support an interpolation. In certain locations, such as Hillsborough 
County, FL, there are a sufficient number of lead and TSP monitors to generate an 
interpolation with a pronounced gradient around each monitor.  The lead and TSP 
monitoring network in other non-attainment areas can in some cases be sparse, 
and the resulting interpolation does not appear to generate a meaningful gradient, 
such as in Delaware County, IN.
· The application of the monitor rollback technique to estimate full attainment air 
quality changes introduces some uncertainty to the analysis. This technique 
simulates the air quality change associated with an emissions control strategy that 
is capable of just attaining each standard alternative at each monitor. This 
approach to estimating air quality changes is different from the reduced-form air 
quality model employed to develop the emissions control strategy. When utilizing 
this reduced-form model to identify control strategies for each standard 
alternative, in certain cases emission controls achieved reductions in ambient lead 
below the standard alternative under analysis. In other cases, the modeled control 
strategies were insufficient to model full attainment with all monitors. The 
monitor rollback approach used to estimate full attainment benefits does not 
reflect this variability in attainment status, because it adjusts the violating monitor 
value down to, but not below, the standard alternative. Thus, where the control 
strategy attains air quality improvements below the standard at violating monitors, 
the monitor rollback approach will not reflect the additional benefits associated 
5-40
with this air quality improvement. Conversely, where the control strategy does not 
fully attain the standard alternative at a given monitor, the rollback technique 
would overstate benefits because it adjusts the monitor value all the way down to 
the standard, below a level actually achieved by the control strategy.
· The estimation of the population to which the benefits apply when using the 
radius method of exposure estimation is uncertain.  We made a number of 
assumptions in the process of estimating the population living within the 10 km 
radius around each monitor which generated a conservative upper-bound 
exposure estimate.  First, we assumed that the population within each census 
block group is uniformly distributed, and therefore, that the fraction of the block 
group geographically that overlapped with the radius corresponded to the fraction 
of the population living within the radius.  In addition, we used 2000 Census data 
to calculate the population living within each radius and distributed it into five-
year age groups by gender using the 2000 Census data for the county in which the 
monitor resides.  We assumed that block groups falling inside the radius that 
reside in neighboring counties had the same age and gender distributions as the 
county in which the monitor resides.  If these assumptions are inaccurate, the 
benefits results could potentially be under- or overestimated.
· We assumed that the IQ point effects of a change in concurrent blood lead (i.e., 
the effects of a change in 2020) apply to all children in our study population that 
were under seven years of age in 2020.  If there is a critical window of exposure 
for IQ effects (e.g., between the ages of one and two), then we could potentially 
be overestimating benefits in 2020 because we would have overestimated the 
population affected by reduced lead exposure in that year.  However, if partial or 
full achievement of the alternative NAAQS levels might occur earlier than 2020, 
the children in our 0-6 age cohort who are past any critical window in 2020 would 
have realized the partial or full benefits of reduced lead exposures in those earlier 
years.  Thus, the issue of a potential critical developmental window reflects 
uncertainty in both the timing and size of benefits.
· The use of air:blood ratios represents a first approximation to the impact of 
changes in ambient air concentrations of lead on concurrent blood lead levels, 
applied in the absence of modeling data on lead transport and deposition and the 
on direct and indirect human exposures.  While the values we apply match fairly 
well with available literature, there are relatively few studies that report such 
values or provide sufficient data to calculate such ratios.  Further, the lead 
concentrations in those studies tend to be higher than those modeled here 
(USEPA, 2007a); thus uncertainty remains as to whether the same ratios would be 
expected at lower levels, or whether air exposures are more or less efficient at 
changing concurrent blood lead levels at these lower concentrations.
· If the air:blood ratio we apply for children or a similar value is also valid for 
estimating adult exposures, then our primary benefits understate the true health 
benefits accruing to the lead-exposed populations because they exclude impacts 
on morbidity and mortality impacts on adults as well as impacts on prenatal 
5-41
mortality.  Additional research is needed to improve our understanding of the 
impacts of adult air exposure on adult blood lead levels.
· The earnings-based value-per-IQ-point lost that we apply in this analysis most 
likely represents a lower bound on the true value of a lost IQ point, because it is 
essentially a cost-of-illness measure, not a measure of an individual’s willingness-
to-pay (WTP) to avoid the loss of an IQ point.  Welfare economics emphasizes 
WTP measures as the more complete estimate of economic value. 
· The earnings-based estimate of the value-per-IQ-point lost is based on current 
data on labor-force participation rates, survival probabilities, and assumptions 
about educational costs and real wage growth in the future.  To the extent these 
factors diverge from these values in the future, our lifetime earnings estimate may 
be under- or overestimated.  
· Co-control benefits estimated here reflect the application of a national dollar 
benefit per ton estimate of the benefits of reducing directly emitted fine 
particulates from point sources.  Because they are based on national-level 
analysis, the benefit-per-ton estimates used here do not reflect local meteorology, 
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to 
an over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly 
emitted fine particulates.

CHAPTER 6.  COST ANALYSIS APPROACH AND RESULTS
This chapter describes our initial analysis of the engineering costs and monitoring costs 
associated with attaining the proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for 
lead and the alternative standards outlined in Chapter 1.70  Cost estimates will be revised and 
improved during development of the RIA for the final Pb NAAQS.  We present in this draft our 
initial analysis of these costs (using a simple fixed cost-per-ton methodology for unidentified 
costs, as discussed below) in separate sections.  To begin, Section 6.1 presents the cost estimates 
and is broken out into four subsections.  The first subsection summarizes the data and methods 
that we employed to estimate the costs associated with the control strategies outlined in Chapter 
4.  As indicated in Chapter 4, these strategies rely exclusively on the application of point source 
controls.  The second subsection presents county level estimates of the costs of identified 
controls associated with the regulatory alternatives examined in this RIA.  Following this 
discussion, the third subsection describes unidentified controls that may be implemented to 
comply with the proposed lead NAAQS, and discusses the additional incremental costs that 
remain unquantified to reach full attainment in all areas.  The fourth subsection gives a brief 
discussion of the monitoring costs.  This section concludes with a summary of the preliminary 
estimates of total costs for the regulatory alternatives examined (using the illustrative control 
scenario and the draft fixed cost-per-ton approach for unidentified cost portion of the analysis).  
Sections 6.2 and 6.3 summarize the economic and energy impacts of the Proposed Rule, 
respectively, while Section 6.4 outlines the main limitations of the analysis.  (Note that for the 
final RIA we intend to explore alternative ways to value unidentified controls including 
approaches which incorporate increasing marginal cost with increasing stringency of control.)
As noted earlier, this draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides illustrative 
estimates of the incremental costs and monetized human health benefits of attaining a revised 
primary lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) within the current 
monitoring network71.  Many of the highest-emitting Pb sources do not have nearby Pb-TSP 
monitors, and it is important to note that there may be many more potential nonattainment areas 
than have been analyzed in this RIA.  Because of time and data constraints, in this draft RIA, 
estimates of costs and benefits employed different techniques for estimating future air quality. 
This results in benefits estimates that represent full attainment, and cost estimates that do not 
represent full attainment.  These differences will be addressed in the final RIA, and further 
improvements to estimation techniques will be explored.
It should be noted again that overall data limitations are very significant for this analysis. 
One critical area of uncertainty is the limited TSP-Pb monitoring network (discussed in chapter 
2).  Because monitors are present in only 86 counties nationwide, the universe of monitors 
exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very small; only 36 counties above 0.05 µg/m3, 
and only 23 counties exceeding the lowest proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 µg/m3.  Because we 
know that many of the highest-emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP 
  
70 The costs presented in this chapter represent the direct pollution control expenditures associated with NAAQS 
compliance.  As such, they do not reflect the general equilibrium impacts of the proposed rule.  
71 There are currently 189 monitors representing 86 counties, but only 36 counties have monitors which exceed 0.05 
ug/m3.
6-2
monitors (see section 2.1.7), it is likely that there may be many more potential nonattainment 
areas than have been analyzed in this draft RIA.  We should also emphasize that these cost 
estimates represent controlling Pb emissions using hypothetical control strategies, assuming no 
technological advances in emission control technology.
It is important also to note that this chapter presents initial cost estimates associated with 
both identified and unidentified point source measures.  Identified point source controls include 
known measures to known sources that may be implemented to attain the proposed NAAQS, 
whereas unidentified controls include hypothetical additional measures that may be implemented 
in areas that would remain in nonattainment with the NAAQS following the implementation of 
identified controls to known sources.  The marginal cost curve for this analysis was derived from 
the costs to the larger sources for which we had identified controls.  To estimate the costs of 
unidentified controls, we chose a constant cost equal to the 98th percentile of the marginal cost 
curve.  We recognize that valuing all unidentified tons at the same cost per ton is an 
oversimplification.  We also recognize that as we add additional levels of control to well-
controlled sources to capture an ever smaller increment of emissions, the marginal cost of the 
additional emission control generally increases.  Therefore increasingly stringent standards lead 
to increasing marginal costs.  In these instances, taking into account the entire marginal cost 
curve may more fully capture the increasing cost.  Note also that in this analysis, unidentified 
controls include not only additional levels of control for well-controlled sources, but also sources 
that were not matched with known controls.  We do not know whether this second level of 
uncertainty will lead to higher costs per ton.  For the final RIA we intend to explore both finding 
more identified controls, and also finding ways to value unidentified controls that do not use a 
single constant cost per ton.  Note also that the addition of unidentified controls to sources above 
a specific level of emissions (see section 4.4.3) does not bring all areas all the way to attainment 
for four of the five alternative standards analyzed.  Because benefits were calculated assuming 
that each monitor just attains each standard alternative, this creates a potential mismatch between 
the costs and benefits calculated for each projected non-attainment area.  However, on balance, 
the influence of this inconsistency is very small.
It is also important to here that the universe of sources to which unidentified controls are 
added is a known universe; note however we are not able to identify a known control device or 
work practice. There are several reasons why identified controls may not be sufficient to reach 
attainment in a given area:
1. The area might be characterized by emissions from several very large sources.  
This is true in only a few areas (e.g., Jefferson and Iron Counties in MO).  In 
these areas, there may be large reductions achieved with identified or even pre-
existing controls, but there are no further known controls available to reduce the 
remaining emissions after those identified controls are applied.
2. Identified controls exist, but their cost-effectiveness exceeds $16,000 per pound, 
and therefore they are not implemented.  This is true in areas characterized by 
many small point sources (e.g., Los Angeles, CA and a few other urban areas).
3. Point source controls could be identified for some sources, but could not be 
identified for enough of the emissions sources that contribute to ambient lead in 
6-3
the area.  This is true in areas where there is a metals processing industry, but no 
one source or industry dominates (e.g., in Cuyahoga County, OH and in some 
parts of PA).
4. In some cases, identified controls are sufficient to reach one or more of the 
alternatives (e.g., Beaver, PA), but unidentified controls are necessary to reach 
more stringent alternatives.   In general, unidentified controls are applied in more 
areas under the more stringent alternatives.
The sections that follow describe our approach for estimating the costs of both types of 
controls.
As is discussed throughout this report, the technologies and control strategies selected for 
this analysis are illustrative of one approach that nonattainment areas may employ to comply 
with the revised lead standard.  Potential control programs may be designed and implemented in 
a number of ways, and EPA anticipates that State and Local governments will consider those 
programs that are best suited for local conditions. As such, the costs described in this chapter 
generally cover the annualized costs of purchasing, installing, and operating the referenced 
technologies. Because we are uncertain of the specific actions that State Agencies will take to 
design State Implementation Plans to meet the revised standard, we do not estimate the costs that 
government agencies may incur to implement these control strategies.
6.1 Engineering Cost Estimates
6.1.1  Data and Methods: Identified Controls
Consistent with the emissions analysis presented in Chapter 3, our analysis of the costs 
associated with the proposed lead NAAQS focuses on point source particulate matter (PM) 
controls.  For the purposes of this analysis, these controls largely include measures from the 
AirControlNET control technology database.  The analysis also includes additional measures 
associated with operating permits and/or New Source Performance Review standards applicable 
to sources similar to those included in our analysis.  
6.1.1.1  AirControlNET Controls
AirControlNET, a PC based database tool that EPA has used extensively for previous 
analyses of air pollution control costs, served as the primary source of cost information for our 
analysis of the proposed lead NAAQS.  The program includes a detailed database of PM control 
measures (and measures for other pollutants) that can readily be linked to the 2002 National 
Emissions Inventory (NEI) to generate source specific estimates of the costs associated with air 
pollution policy.  The controls included in AirControlNET represent proven retrofit technologies 
with control efficiencies and costs documented extensively by EPA and other sources.  When 
using this information to estimate the costs for a specific source, AirControlNET compares these 
data with information from the 2002 NEI on the source’s existing controls.  In those cases where 
6-4
a new control identified by AirControlNET would replace an existing control, the program 
estimates the incremental cost as the difference between the costs of the new control and the 
costs associated with the existing control.  
For the analysis of the proposed lead NAAQS, AirControlNET used one of three methods 
to estimate the costs of a given control: 
1) Detailed cost function based on source specific engineering parameters.  
AirControlNET estimates the costs of some technologies as a function of several 
key engineering parameters, such as the source’s capacity or stack flow rate; 
2) Dollar per ton of PM10 controlled. For minor PM controls (i.e., increased 
monitoring frequency for PM controls and improvements to continuous emissions 
monitoring systems), AirControlNET estimates costs by applying a fixed cost per 
ton value (approximately $6,300 per ton for CEMs in 2006 dollars) to the tonnage 
of PM controlled.72  
3) Hybrid. For several PM controls, AirControlNET includes a detailed cost 
equation but only uses it if a source's stack flow rate is at least 5 cubic 
feet/minute.  If the stack flow rate is below this threshold, AirControlNET applies 
a fixed cost per ton value to the tonnage of PM10 controlled.73 AirControlNET 
employs this hybrid approach for most of the major PM controls included in our 
analysis.74
To estimate costs based on the cost per ton values described under items 2 and 3 above, it 
was necessary to first estimate the reduction in PM2.5 or PM10 emissions for each relevant source.  
Where possible, we developed these estimates based on the baseline PM emissions of each 
source, as adapted from the 2002 NEI, and the estimated control efficiency of each measure.75  
The 2002 NEI, however, does not include baseline PM emissions data for many of the sources 
included in our analysis.  For each of these sources, we employed one of two approaches to 
estimate baseline PM emissions:
1) SPECIATE approach. EPA's SPECIATE database includes sample PM 
speciation profiles for a variety of sources and maps these profiles to individual 
source classification codes (SCCs).  For lead sources with SCCs represented by 
these profiles, we estimated baseline PM2.5 and PM10 emissions based on the 
baseline lead emissions of these sources and the corresponding PM speciation 
profile in SPECIATE.  For example, if a source has baseline lead emissions of 
0.02 tons/year and the SPECIATE database suggests that lead, on average, 
  
72 In some cases, this cost/ton value is specific to PM2.5, while in other cases it is specific to all PM.
73 This stands in contrast to the cost/ton values for the controls summarized under method 2, which are estimated as 
a cost/ton of PM2.5 controlled or cost/ton of total PM controlled.
74 By major controls, we mean all controls except for increased monitoring frequency and improvements to 
continuous monitoring systems.
75 Chapter 3 describes the adjustments that we made to the 2002 NEI to account for controls expected to be 
implemented prior to the 2020 target year for this analysis.  
6-5
represents two percent of the PM10 emissions for other sources that share its SCC, 
we assume that the source emits one ton of PM10/year in the baseline.  We used 
this approach to estimate the baseline PM2.5 and PM10 emissions of all sources for 
which the 2002 NEI includes no PM emissions data but that are represented by 
the speciation profiles in SPECIATE.76
2) Average speciation approach.  Although SPECIATE includes speciation profiles 
for a wide range of sources, the database does not include profiles applicable to 
all of the sources included in our analysis.  Therefore, we were unable to use 
SPECIATE to estimate the baseline PM2.5 and PM10 emissions for several of the 
lead sources for which the 2002 NEI includes no PM data.  For these sources, we 
estimated baseline PM2.5 and PM10 emissions based on the PM speciation profile 
of those lead sources included in our analysis for which the 2002 NEI includes 
PM emissions data.  Our analysis of these sources suggests that lead represents 
approximately 1.1 percent of their PM10 emissions and 1.5 percent of their PM2.5
emissions.  We assume that these values apply to all lead sources for which the 
2002 NEI includes no PM emissions estimates and for which SPECIATE includes 
no relevant PM speciation profiles. 
Within AirControlNET’s standard format, the tool provides estimates of control costs for 
direct PM controls only for those sources emitting 10 or more tons of PM10 per year.  Because 
many of the point sources included in our analysis fall below this emissions threshold, we have 
changed this standard format so that ACN can apply direct PM controls to sources emitting any 
amount of PM10.77 The cost equations and cost per ton values for major controls, however, do 
not necessarily apply with great accuracy to such controls for sources below this PM emissions 
threshold.
To better estimate the costs of direct PM controls for such small point sources, we used 
ACN’s technology-specific cost and emission reduction estimates for these sources in order to 
estimate cost per ton values for small sources.  Such costs may be quite high on a per ton basis; 
for example, applying a pulse-jet fabric filter on a PM10 source with less than 10 tons per year 
yields a cost per ton of $368,000. We expect that application of these point source controls to 
such small PM sources will be highly limited in actual practice for lead SIPs.   More information 
on these point source controls can be found in the AirControlNET control measures 
documentation.78

77 In this analysis, we apply controls to small point sources with emissions below the 10 tons per year PM10 ACN 
application threshold, up to the 98th percentile of marginal costs as described in Chapter 4.  We apply controls to 
small point sources due to the extent of lead nonattainment associated with the alternative standards examined in this 
RIA and the lack of identified point source and other controls available to examine attainment with these standards 
as noted in Chapter 4.

6.1.1.2 Controls Identified from New Source Performance Standards and Recent Operating 
Permits
In addition to controls included in AirControlNET, our analysis of the costs associated 
with the proposed lead NAAQS reflects the potential implementation of controls identified from 
other sources.  These include measures enumerated in recent operating permits for sources 
similar to those included in our draft RIA as well as measures that new and 
modified/reconstructed sources of PM emissions are expected to implement for compliance with 
New Source Performance Standards.  The specific measures identified for these sources include 
the following:
· Increased electrostatic precipitator (ESP) collector plate area for EGU boilers.  
The most common way to upgrade an ESP is to increase the specific collector area 
(SCA), which is an important variable in characterizing ESP performance. One of the most 
common routes by which to increase SCA is to simply increase the collector plate area by adding 
additional collector plates. The ESP modifications considered as control measures in this draft 
RIA include adding enough collection plate area to be equivalent to one or two new fields. The 
PM2.5 reductions from adding 1 plate are about 44%, and about 67% from adding 2 plates. These 
levels will vary depending on how much SCA resides in each field. If an ESP designer has 
installed a large number of fields, with a relatively low amount of surface area in each field, the 
additional PM2.5 reductions obtained by adding additional fields would be relatively low. 
The costs of these upgrades vary by the capacity of the unit with the ESP.   This variance 
enters into the equations to estimate capital and fixed operating and maintenance (O&M) costs.  
Variable O&M costs are constant for all unit capacities. The equations for estimating the costs of 
adding 2 collector plates are the following:  
Capital Cost in $/kW = 17.5 x (250/MW)0.3 (MW is unit capacity in megawatts)
Variable O&M cost in mills/kWh  = 0.013 (same for all unit capacities) 
Fixed O&M Cost in $/kW-yr = 0.31 x  (250/MW)0.3(MW is unit capacity in megawatts)79
Two important assumptions that underlie these equations are a capacity factor of 85% 
(i.e., the unit is operating 85% of the time in a typical year), and a capital recovery factor of 0.12.  
The capital recovery factor reflects the expected economic life of the additional collector plates 
and the interest rate used to annualize the capital costs.  In this case, the interest rate is the same 
as that employed in the current IPM.80

An important caveat for these costs is that they only appropriate for ESP modifications at 
EGUs.  While there is no technical reason why these modifications cannot take place at industrial 
boilers or other non-EGU units, these equations and data are based on information taken from 
EGU operations and hence is not appropriate for application to non-EGU units.
· Capture hoods vented to a baghouse at iron and steel mills.  
Virtually all iron and steel mills have some type of PM control measure, but there is 
additional equipment that could be installed to reduce emissions further. Capture hoods that route 
PM emissions from a blast furnace casthouse to a fabric filter can provide 80% to 90% additional 
emission reductions from an iron or steel mill.  We estimate the annualized costs for this control 
measure at $5,000/ton of PM2.5 emission reduction.81
· Diesel particulate filter (for stationary sources such as diesel generators); 
This control incorporates directly-emitted PM2.5 reductions from stationary internal 
combustion engines that will be affected by the compression-ignition internal combustion engine 
new source performance standard (NSPS) promulgated on June 28, 2006.    Diesel particulate 
filters (DPF) are likely to be the control technology required for these engines to meet the NSPS 
requirements.  The control is applied here as a retrofit to existing stationary internal combustion 
engines in our inventory. 
We have taken the control efficiency and cost data from technical support documents 
prepared for the U.S. EPA as part of analyses undertaken for the final compression-ignition 
NSPS.82 The control efficiency for PM2.5 reductions from applying DPF is 90 percent at an 
annualized cost of $9,000/ton.  A major assumption in this analysis is that engines to which a 
DPF is applied will be use ultra-low sulfur fuel (ULSD) in the future.   To the extent that these 
existing engines are not using ULSD, the level of control is likely to be lower than estimated in 
this draft RIA since DPFs will clog if the engine being controlled uses a higher-sulfur fuel than 
ULSD (15 ppm sulfur) and thus yield lower reductions of PM2.5.  
· Upgrade of CEMs and increased monitoring frequency of PM controls (for 
sources where not already identified as a control by ACN).
This control is an upgrade to existing control measures or an improvement in control 
efficiency due to how existing control measures operate from increases in monitoring. Such 
controls can lead to small reductions in PM (5% to 7%) at annualized costs ranging from $600 to 
$5,200/ton of PM2.5.  This control is applicable to ESPs and baghouses at both EGU and non-

6.1.2 Engineering Cost Estimates for Identified Controls 
Based on the data and methods outlined above, we estimated the costs associated with 
implementing the control strategies presented in Chapter 3.  Table 6-1 summarizes these costs by 
monitor area.  As indicated in the table, the annual costs of these controls range from $11 million 
under the 0.5 μg/m3 standard to $84 million under the 0.05 μg/m3 standard, assuming a discount 
rate of three percent.  If we apply a seven percent discount rate, these values increase to $12 
million and $88 million for the 0.5 and 0.05 μg/m3 standards, respectively.  Consistent with 
Chapter 4's summary of the air quality impacts associated with identified controls, the cost 
estimates in Table 6-1 reflect partial attainment with both the proposed and alternative standards.  
For the 0.3 μg/m3 end of the proposed standard, the costs in Table 6-1 reflect attainment in 30 of 
the 36 monitor areas included in this analysis.  For the 0.1 μg/m3 target, the estimates in Table 6-
1 reflect attainment in 20 monitor areas.
The results in Table 6-1 illustrate that the costs of the proposed NAAQS are likely to vary 
by monitor area.  With the exception of the 0.5 μg/m3 and 0.3 μg/m3 standards, the costs of 
identified measures are expected to be highest in Jefferson County and Iron County, Missouri.  
As indicated in Chapter 3, the baseline lead emissions for these two counties are higher than the 
emissions of any other county in the U.S.  This reflects the presence of major lead smelting 
operations in both counties.  Following Jefferson and Iron Counties, the costs of identified 
measures are expected to be highest in Berks County, Pennsylvania.  Similar to Jefferson and 
Iron Counties, emissions from lead smelting operations contribute significantly to the ambient 
concentration of lead in Berks County. 
Table 6-2 presents the costs of identified controls/pound of lead emissions avoided in 
each monitor area.  The estimates presented in this table suggest that, in general, the cost/pound 
of avoided lead emissions increases significantly for a given monitor as the standard becomes 
more stringent.  For example, the cost/pound for Williamson County, Tennessee steadily 
increases from $300/pound under the 0.5 μg/m3 standard to $900/pound under the 0.05 μg/m3 
standard.  This is consistent with local areas first targeting sources where relatively low cost 
reductions may be achieved and subsequently achieving reductions from sources that are more 
costly to control (i.e., moving up the area's marginal abatement cost curve).

6.1.3 Engineering Cost Estimates for Unidentified Controls
As indicated above, the identified measures reflected in Tables 6-1 and 6-2 do not result 
in attainment with the proposed or alternative lead standards in several areas.  In these areas, 
additional unidentified measures will likely be necessary to reach attainment.  Chapters 3 and 4 
describe our assumptions about the control efficiency of these measures and their effect on 
ambient lead concentrations.  To estimate the costs associated with unidentified measures, we 
assume a fixed cost of $32 million/ton or $16,000/pound in 2006 dollars.84 This is consistent 
with the 98th percentile of the cost/ton for identified controls at large point sources discussed in 
Chapter 4.85 Post the application of unidentified controls there remains an additional increment 
to attainment in some geographic areas.  This additional increment is represented throughout this 
section as “+C”.  
Table 6-3 presents the costs of unidentified controls by monitor area.  As indicated in the 
table, these costs range from $0.6 million +C under the 0.5 μg/m3 standard to approximately $2 
billion +C under the 0.05 μg/m3 standard.  As suggested by Tables 6-1 and 6-3, the extent to 
which these costs exceed those associated with identified controls alone increases with the 
stringency of the standard.  This is consistent with the emissions analysis presented in Chapter 4, 
which suggests that local areas' reliance on unidentified controls would increase as the standard 
becomes more stringent.    
  
84 This estimate reflects a discount rate of three percent.  The identified controls have explicit capital costs that are 
annualized, as well as annual operating costs.  The discount rate influences the annualization of the capital costs.  
For the unidentified controls, pure annualized costs were used; explicit capital and annual costs were not broken out.  
While the derivation of the fixed cost for unidentified controls used a marginal cost curve calculated at a discount 
rate of 3%, it is impossible to determine what difference use of a 7% discount rate would make without making 
additional assumptions about the breakdown of capital versus annual costs for unidentified controls.
85 The fixed cost estimate for unidentified controls was developed based on the cost of controls with a 3 percent 
discount rate.  Because it is a fixed cost, however, when applied to estimate the costs of unidentified controls it is 
assumed not to be affected by the discount rate assumption.  That is, costs for unidentified controls are assumed to 
be the same for the 3 and 7 percent discount rate.

6.1.4 Monitoring Costs
Consistent with the scope of this rulemaking, which includes monitoring provisions, 
monitoring costs are included here. As part of the regulatory package accompanying the revised 
standard, revised Pb monitoring requirements being proposed.  The rule proposes revisions to the 
network design requirements, QA requirements, and the minimum sampling frequency for Pb 
monitoring.  These changes are being proposed to ensure adequate Pb monitoring will be 
performed to determine compliance with the proposed Pb NAAQS.  A number of options are 
6-15
being proposed as part of the Pb NAAQS revision including the level of the standard and the 
averaging time for the standard which directly affect the associated monitoring burden.  The final 
decisions on these options will not be made until promulgation of the final rule.  Total costs for 
expansion of the monitoring network is estimated to be $8.3 million.  
The actual monitoring burden will vary depending on the level and the averaging time for the 
final standard.  In the draft ICR, we have estimated the potential burden for the lowest option 
proposed (i.e. 0.1ug/m3; 2nd max monthly).  A more specific estimate will be provided in the 
final rule package.  Although we have not estimated the costs of the monitoring network at 
different levels of the standard, based on the information we had at the time of issuance of the proposed rule,
there are approximately 704 facilities that would require monitoring at a level of 0.1ug/m3, as 
compared to 194 facilities that would require monitoring at a level of 0.3ug/m3 (see: 
http://www.epa.gov/oar/lead/pdfs/20080502_maps4.pdf).  For more detail, see OMB 2060-0084, 
ICR #940.21.  
6.1.5 Summary of Cost Estimates
The difference between the county level results presented in Tables 6-4 and 6-1 suggests 
that, in some local areas, unidentified measures will represent the majority of the costs incurred 
by affected sources.  For example in Iron County, MO, we estimate costs of $6.9 million for 
identified measures in Iron County, Missouri for the 0.1 μg/m3 standard (assuming a discount 
rate of three percent).  As indicated in Table 6-3, unidentified measures would increase the 
county's estimated costs for this standard by $304 million to approximately $311 million.  Note 
also that in Iron County, MO, identified controls for the 0.1 μg/m3 standard, using a three percent 
discount rate, cost on average $300 per pound (see Table 6-2), but we assume all unidentified 
controls cost $16,000 per pound.  
The significant difference between the costs of identified controls alone and the cost of 
achieving attainment (i.e. including both identified and  unidentified controls) in this and other 
areas reflects the limited information available to EPA on the control measures that sources may 
implement.  It is important to remember that, compared to recent NAAQS RIAs, our current 
knowledge of the costs and nature of lead emissions controls is relatively poor.  Lead in ambient 
air has not been a focus for all but a few areas of the country for the last decade or more; the 
alternative standards represent a substantial tightening of the existing NAAQS.  As a result, 
although AirControlNET contains information on a large number of different point source 
controls, we would expect that State and local air quality managers would have access to 
additional information on the controls available to the most significant sources. 
The cost estimates in Table 6-4 show that the costs associated with the 0.5 μg/m3 
alternative standard are significantly lower than the estimated costs associated with the proposed 
range of 0.1 to 0.3 μg/m3.  This largely reflects the extent to which unidentified controls would 
be necessary for lead NAAQS compliance under the 0.5 μg/m3 standard versus the proposed 
standard of 0.1 to 0.3 μg/m3.  As indicated in Chapter 4, the emissions reductions achieved with 
identified controls alone would be sufficient for attainment with the 0.5 μg/m3 standard for all 
but one of the 36 monitor areas analyzed as part of this assessment.  In the one area where 
unidentified measures would be necessary for compliance with the 0.5 μg/m3 standard, 
unidentified controls would need to reduce lead emissions by just 0.02 tons.  By comparison, 
under the 0.3 standard, 12.41 tons of reductions from unidentified controls are necessary for 
areas to reach attainment.  At a cost of more than $32 million per ton, this 12.39 ton difference 
accounts for approximately $400 million of the difference in costs between the 0.5 and 0.3 μg/m3
6-16
standards. It is also important to note that most of the incremental costs associated with the 0.3 
μg/m3 standard relative to the 0.5 μg/m3 standard are associated with the implementation of 
unidentified controls in Jefferson County, Missouri.  
6-17
Table 6-5 presents the cost/pound of lead emissions reduced for identified and 
unidentified measures.  The values shown in this exhibit are generally less variable than the 
corresponding values for identified measures presented in Table 6-2.  This reflects our 
assumption of a fixed cost of $16,000 per pound ($32 million per ton) for all unidentified 
measures.  Table 6-6 provides a summary of total costs to achieve each alternative standard 
through application of controls to point sources.

Unquantified costs are indicated with a “+C” to represent the additional sum of 
unquantified costs of full attainment.  Full attainment costs were not calculated for some monitor 
areas for a few reasons.  One such location is Ottawa County, OK where there are no existing 
sources of lead emissions, yet there is a large Superfund site and the federal government is 
buying out the remaining residents.86 Another example is Logan County, OH, where we will 
investigate the application of additional known control measures to smaller sources for the final 
RIA.  
Figure 6-1 shows the relative costs estimated from identified controls (in green) vs. 
unidentified controls (in blue) for each alternative standard.

6.2 Economic Impacts
The assessment of economic impacts was conducted simply based on those source 
categories which are controlled in this analysis. The impacts presented here are an extension of 
the engineering costs, where engineering costs are allocated to specific source categories by
standard industrial classification (SIC) code.  Although the costs outlined in the previous section 
may affect a range of industries, we expect that most of the costs associated with the proposed 
lead NAAQS will be concentrated in a limited number of industry sectors.  As indicated in Table 
6-7, we estimate that the primary metals industries (excluding sources with SIC codes 331 and 
335) will incur costs of $431 million to $1.2 billion (2006 dollars) under the proposed standard 
of 0.1 to 0.3 μg/m3, assuming a discount rate of 3 percent.  This represents 75 to 96 percent of 
the total costs associated with the standard and 1.2 to 3.3 percent of the industry's sales in 2005.  
Table 6-7 also shows that other industry sectors expected to incur significant costs include 
electric utilities (SIC 4911); blast furnaces and steel mills (SIC 3312); and nonferrous metals 
rolling, drawing, and extrusion (SIC 335).  The projected compliance costs for all of these 
industries represent a smaller fraction of sales than the corresponding costs for the primary 
metals industry (SIC 33 excluding SIC codes 331 and 335). 
Table 6-8 presents capital and O&M costs by industry for identified measures under the 
0.1 and 0.3 μg/m3 standards (i.e., both the low and high ends of the proposed range).87 Costs 
associated with unidentified controls are not reflected in the table because the distribution of 
costs between capital and O&M is uncertain for these measures.  As indicated in the table, O&M 
represents most of the costs associated with identified controls.  This implies that although the 
upfront capital costs associated with the proposed standard may be significant for affected 
industries, these costs are expected to represent a fraction of the standard's total costs.
  
87 The costs presented in the table reflect a discount rate of three percent.  Because the purpose of the table is to 
show the approximate distribution of costs between capital and O&M, the table presents costs based on just one 
discount rate for ease of presentation.

6.3 Energy Impacts
This section summarizes the energy consumption impacts of the proposed and alternative 
lead NAAQS.  The proposed Pb NAAQS revisions do not constitute a “significant energy 
action” as defined in Executive Order 13211; this information merely represents impacts of the 
illustrative control strategies applied in the draft RIA.  
For this draft RIA, implementation of the control measures needed for attainment with 
the alternative standards will likely lead to increased energy consumption among lead emitting 
facilities.  To control emissions effectively, these measures require a significant amount of 
electricity that affected facilities are not expected to consume under baseline conditions.  The 
available information on these controls suggests that they are not typically powered by natural 
gas or other fossil fuels; therefore, our analysis of energy impacts focuses exclusively on 
electricity consumption.  In addition, because the energy intensity of unidentified controls is 
uncertain, we only consider the energy impacts associated with identified controls.
6-27
To assess the electricity consumption impacts associated with identified controls, we 
relied on the AirControlNET outputs generated for this analysis.  For most identified controls, 
AirControlNET estimates electricity costs separately from other operating and maintenance 
(O&M) costs.  Therefore, for sources expected to implement these controls, AirControlNET 
provides direct estimates of the additional electricity costs expected under the standards.  We 
calculate the electricity consumption associated with these costs based on the unit cost of 
electricity assumed by AirControlNET (7.8 cents/kilowatt hour in 2006 dollars).  
For a number of identified controls, AirControlNET does not separate the cost of 
electricity from other O&M costs.  Similarly, the cost data for several controls identified from 
sources other than AirControlNET do not distinguish between electricity and other O&M costs.  
We estimate the electricity costs associated with these measures based on electricity's assumed 
share of total O&M, which we estimate based on AirControlNET's results for those controls 
where it separates electricity costs from other O&M costs.  For some controls, O&M costs are 
not estimated separately from capital costs.  In these cases, we assume that O&M represents a 
fixed share of annual costs based on the cost data for those controls where O&M and capital are 
calculated separately.
Table 6-9 summarizes the estimated energy impacts associated with the proposed and 
alternative standards.  As indicated in the table, we estimate that sources installing identified 
controls under the proposed rule will increase their electricity consumption in 2020 by 
approximately 3,900 to 27,400 megawatt-hours (MWh).  By comparison, the iron and steel 
industry alone is projected to purchase 67.6 million MWh of electricity in 2020.88

6.4 Limitations
Although the cost analysis presented in this chapter provides a reasonable approximation 
of the costs associated with the proposed lead NAAQS using hypothetical control scenario given 
the available information, we note the following limitations of the analysis:
  
88 U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2007, February 2007.
6-28
· Analysis limited to point source controls. Because limited data are available on 
fugitive and area source emissions, our analysis of the costs associated with the 
proposed and alternative lead NAAQS does not consider area source and direct 
fugitive controls that may be implemented to comply with these standards.89  
Therefore, in those areas where point source controls are insufficient to attain the 
standard, we were unable to model full compliance with the revised NAAQS and, 
in all likelihood, underestimated costs.  However, for areas where point source 
controls are sufficient to reach attainment, we may have overestimated costs if 
more cost effective fugitive or area source controls are likely to be available in 
these areas.
· Incomplete information for point source controls. To assess the cost of reducing 
point source lead emissions, this analysis relies upon PM control cost information 
from AirControlNET.  For several sources, however, AirControlNET contains no 
information on the PM controls available, and we are unable to estimate costs for 
these sources.  Such sources represent approximately 24 percent of the point 
source lead emissions included in our analysis (i.e., AirControlNET contains 
control measure data for those lead sources that represent 76 percent of the lead 
emissions included in the analysis).  Costs to control lead emissions from these 
sources may be less than or greater than costs to control emissions from other 
sources.
· Uncertainty about methods for reaching tighter control levels in the future.  It 
is not known whether industrial sources will in the future make improvements to
existing particulate matter controls to control Pb emissions, whether there will be 
further application of existing control technology in series with controls that 
might already be employed at a source, or whether we might expect new control 
technology to be developed.
· Uncertainty associated with unidentified measures. As indicated above, many 
areas are expected to rely heavily on unidentified controls to reach attainment 
with the standards.  The cost of implementing these measures, though estimated 
here based on the costs for identified controls, is uncertain. Many of these sources 
are already well-controlled for particulate matter, and additional control for the 
remaining increment of Pb might be difficult to achieve.  Many other sources are 
boilers fired by natural gas.  We are currently investigating these boilers further, 
and are finding that Pb emissions for many of them are likely significantly 
overstated, and should not remain in the inventory for this draft RIA.  We expect 
to make these types of changes to the inventory for the RIA for the final Pb 
NAAQS.
  
89 Although our analysis considers the impact of point source controls on certain fugitive emissions, as described in 
Chapter 4, it does not consider direct fugitive controls.
6-29
· Some costs remained unquantified. In some geographic areas there remains an 
additional sum of unquantified costs to reach full attainment.  Full attainment 
costs were not calculated for some monitor areas for a few reasons.  One such 
location is Ottawa County, OK where there are no existing sources of lead 
emissions, yet there is a large Superfund site and the federal government is buying 
out the remaining residents.90 Another example is Logan County, OH, where we 
will investigate the application of additional known control measures to smaller 
sources for the final RIA.

CHAPTER 7.  ESTIMATES OF BENEFITS AND COSTS
EPA has performed an illustrative analysis to estimate the costs and human health 
benefits of nationally attaining alternative lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS).  This analysis serves both to satisfy the requirements of E.O. 12866 and to provide 
the public with an estimate of the potential costs and benefits of attaining alternative lead 
standards.  This chapter presents our estimates of the primary benefits and the costs expected to 
result from achieving four alternative levels of the lead NAAQS, relative to baseline ambient air 
lead levels.  Our approach to estimating benefits (Chapter 5) and costs (Chapter 6) is described 
elsewhere in this document.  This chapter first presents benefits and costs for scenarios using 
consistent assumptions. We then discuss key uncertainties and limitations.  Finally, we provide a 
summary of key conclusions, considering both the primary results and key uncertainties.
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides illustrative estimates of the incremental 
costs and monetized human health benefits of attaining a revised primary lead (Pb) National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) within the current monitoring network91.  Many of the 
highest-emitting Pb sources do not have nearby Pb-TSP monitors, and it is important to note that 
there may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.  
Because of time and data constraints, in this RIA, estimates of costs and benefits employed 
different techniques for estimating future air quality. This results in benefits estimates that 
represent full attainment, and cost estimates that do not represent full attainment.  These 
differences will be addressed in the final RIA, and further improvements to estimation 
techniques will be explored.
In addition, this draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) seeks to estimate both costs and
benefits for the year 2020; however this draft represents initial estimates using a 2002 baseline 
blood lead level, resulting in a possible overestimate of benefits in the year 2020.  Prior to 
completion of the final draft, assumptions will be revisited and, to the extent technically feasible, 
EPA will update the baseline to reflect expected effects on blood lead levels from other lead 
rules and potentially from an anticipated decline in population blood lead levels.
It should be noted again that overall data limitations are very significant for this analysis. 
One critical area of uncertainty is the limited TSP-Pb monitoring network (discussed in chapter 
2).  Because monitors are present in only 86 counties nationwide, the universe of monitors 
exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very small; only 36 counties above 0.05 μg/m3, 
and only 24 counties exceeding the lowest proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 μg/m3.  Because we 
know that many of the highest-emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP
monitors (see section 2.1.7), it is likely that there may be many more potential nonattainment 
areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.  It is also important to note that the addition of 
unidentified controls to sources above a specific level of emissions (see section 4.4.3) does not 
bring all areas all the way to attainment for four of the five alternative standards analyzed.  
Because benefits were calculated assuming that each monitor just attains each standard 
alternative, this creates a potential mismatch between the costs and benefits calculated for each 
projected non-attainment area.  
  
91 There are currently 189 monitors representing 86 counties, but only 36 counties have monitors which exceed 0.05 
ug/m3.
 7-2
In addition, as discussed in chapter 3 it is not appropriate to conduct regional scale 
modeling for Pb similar to the regional scale modeling conducted for PM and ozone.  Dispersion, 
or plume-based, models are recommended for compliance with the Pb NAAQS; however, 
dispersion models are data –intensive and more appropriate for local scale analyses of emissions 
from individual sources.  It was not feasible to conduct such a large-scale data intensive analysis 
for this RIA.  As a result, the simplified analysis developed for this RIA, while distance-
weighting individual source contributions to ambient Pb concentrations, could not account for 
such locally critical variables as meteorology and source stack height. Note also that the 
emissions inventory has limitations for Pb sources  with very low emissions;  for the final RIA 
we will be reviewing and making improvements to the inventory used in this analysis, and 
incorporating those improvements.
As a result of some of the methodological considerations and uncertainties in developing 
this analysis, this draft RIA does not present a comparison of the estimated benefits and costs, or 
a net benefits calculation associated with each of the standard level alternatives under 
consideration.  EPA has activities underway to make improvements to both cost and benefit 
calculations for the final RIA, recognizing that there will remain significant data gaps and 
uncertainties.   EPA plans to present a net benefits calculation in the final RIA.
7.1 Benefits and Costs
The estimates of benefits and costs presented here reflect illustrative scenarios of future lead NAAQS compliance.  
In all cases, estimates are based on a 2020 compliance date; as a result, such inputs as population and baseline 
emissions and air quality compliance with existing Clean Air Act requirements (including MACT rules affecting 
lead emissions and the recently promulgated PM NAAQS revision) are consistently applied in all estimates 
presented here.  In addition, the two alternative discount rates - 3% and 7% - are used in all relevant components of 
both benefit and cost calculations, for all estimates presented here.  On the other hand, as noted above, the draft 
benefit estimates are developed using a 2002 baseline blood lead level.  Finally, EPA's intention is to present all 
benefit and cost estimates for scenarios that reflect full implementation of the lead NAAQS.  For some alternatives
our emissions controls (Chapter 4) and cost analyses (Chapter 5) do not reflect full attainment of those standards.  
As described more fully in those chapters, in this analysis we apply controls only on point sources, and in a few 
areas those controls are not sufficient to attain the alternative standard.  In that respect, our estimates of benefits and 
costs for the two most stringent alternatives reflect slightly different levels of attainment.  The variable C is used to 
represent unestimated costs associated with the additional incremental controls required to attain each standard.
Table 7.1 and 7.2 presents total national primary estimates of costs and benefits for a 3% 
discount rate; Tables 7.3 and 7.4 present the same information for a 7% discount rate.

The ranges of benefits presented reflect uncertainty about the earnings impact associated 
with IQ gains and variability in the estimates of the PM mortality co-benefits across the available 
effects estimates.  The total benefits range of estimates was developed by first adding the low 
and high ends of the range of monetized lead IQ benefits to the low and high ends of the range of 
PM co-benefits, and then subtracting the total cost estimate from the low and high end of the 
resulting range of total benefits.  
7.2 Discussion of Uncertainties and Limitations
As with other NAAQS RIAs, it should be recognized that all estimates of future costs and 
benefits are not intended to be forecasts of the actual costs and benefits of implementing revised 
standards. Ultimately, states and urban areas will be responsible for developing and 
implementing emissions control programs to reach attainment of the lead NAAQS, with the 
timing of attainment being determined by future decisions by states and EPA.  Our estimates are 
intended to provide information on the general magnitude of the costs and benefits of alternative 
standards, rather than precise predictions of control measures, costs, or benefits.  With these 
caveats, we expect that this analysis can provide a reasonable picture of the types of emissions 
controls that are currently available, the direct costs of those controls, the levels of emissions 
reductions that may be achieved with these controls, the air quality impact that can be expected 
to result from reducing emissions, and the public health benefits of reductions in ambient lead 
levels, as well as coincident reductions in ambient fine particulates.  This analysis identifies 
those areas of the U.S. where our existing knowledge of control strategies is not sufficient to 
allow us to model attainment, and where additional data or research may be needed to develop 
strategies for attainment.
Compared to recent NAAQS RIAs, however, our current knowledge of the costs and 
nature of lead emissions controls and the effects of changes in emissions on air quality and 
exposure is less robust.  Lead in ambient air has not been a focus for all but a few areas of the 
country for the last decade or more.  The proposed standards, while supported by and consistent 
with EPA's review of recent scientific research, represent a substantial tightening of the existing 
NAAQS.  As a result, many of the analyses conducted for this RIA could be significantly 
improved through enhanced research and data in these areas.  Perhaps the greatest need is for 
research on available pollution control technology, work practice changes, and pollution 
prevention options to most cost-effectively control lead emissions directly, rather than as a 
component of lead-bearing PM emissions.
It should be noted again that overall data limitations are very significant for this analysis. 
One critical area of uncertainty is the limited TSP-Pb monitoring network (discussed in chapter 
2).  Because monitors are present in only 86 counties nationwide, the universe of monitors 
exceeding the various target NAAQS levels is very small; only 36 counties above 0.05 μg/m3, 
and only 24 counties exceeding the lowest proposed NAAQS level of 0.10 μg/m3.  Because we 
know that many of the highest-emitting Pb sources in the 2002 NEI do not have nearby Pb-TSP 
monitors (see section 2.1.7), it is likely that there may be many more potential nonattainment 
areas than have been analyzed in this RIA.
 7-6
In addition, as discussed in chapter 3 it is not appropriate to conduct regional scale 
modeling for Pb similar to the regional scale modeling conducted for PM and ozone.  Dispersion, 
or plume-based, models are recommended for compliance with the Pb NAAQS; however, 
dispersion models are data –intensive and more appropriate for local scale analyses of emissions 
from individual sources.  It was not feasible to conduct such a large-scale data intensive analysis 
for this RIA.  As a result, the simplified analysis developed for this RIA, while distance-
weighting individual source contributions to ambient Pb concentrations, could not account for 
such locally critical variables as meteorology and source stack height. Note also that the 
emissions inventory has limitations for Pb sources  with very low emissions;  for the final RIA 
we will be reviewing and making improvements to the inventory used in this analysis, and 
incorporating those improvements.
In the remainder of this section we re-state the most important limitations and 
uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates. 
Uncertainties specifically related to the cost estimates include the following:
· Because limited data are available on fugitive and area source emissions, our 
analysis of the costs associated with the proposed and alternative lead NAAQS 
does not consider fugitive and area source controls that may be implemented to 
comply with these standards.  Therefore, in those areas where point source 
controls are insufficient to attain the standard, we were unable to model full 
compliance with the revised NAAQS, and it is therefore likely that we 
underestimate costs.  However, for areas where point source controls are 
sufficient to reach attainment, we may have overestimated costs if more cost-
effective fugitive or area source controls are likely to be available in these areas.
· To assess the cost of reducing point source lead emissions, this analysis relies 
upon PM control cost information from AirControlNET.  EPA's database of lead-
focused controls is very limited, however, and there are no lead-specific controls 
in AirControlNET.  In addition, for several sources AirControlNET contains no 
information on PM controls either.  Such sources represent approximately 24 
percent of the point source lead emissions included in our analysis (i.e., 
AirControlNET contains control measure data for those lead sources that 
represent 76 percent of the lead emissions included in the analysis).  Costs to 
control lead emissions from these sources may be less than or greater than costs to 
control emissions from other sources.
· As indicated above, many areas are expected to rely heavily on unidentified 
controls to reach attainment with the standards.  The cost of implementing these 
measures, though estimated here based on the costs for identified controls, is 
uncertain. Many of these sources are already well-controlled for particulate 
matter, and additional control for the remaining increment of Pb might be difficult 
to achieve.  Many other sources are boilers fired by natural gas.  We are currently 
investigating these boilers further, and are finding that Pb emission s for many of 
them are likely significantly overstated, and should not remain in the inventory 
 7-7
for this RIA.  We expect to make these types of changes to the inventory for the 
RIA for the final Pb NAAQS. 
Uncertainties related to the benefits estimates include the following: 
· For our primary estimate of the benefits due to gains in children’s IQ, we used a 
log-linear estimate from a recently published pooled analysis of seven studies 
(Lanphear et al., 2005).  Using alternate estimates from other epidemiological 
studies examining the link between blood lead level and children’s IQ has 
significant impact on benefits results.  We found the benefits to decrease by as 
much as 74 percent when an alternate estimate from a paper by Schwartz (1993) 
is used.  This is due in part to the underlying shape of the dose-response 
relationship assumed by each of the functions.  In the Lanphear study, a log-linear 
relationship was found to be the best fit for the data (i.e., the natural log-
transformed blood lead level is used to predict changes in IQ score).  This model 
implies that the magnitude of changes in IQ increases with lower blood lead 
levels.  However, in the Schwartz (1993) and Canfield et al. (2003) studies, a 
single linear model is assumed (i.e., untransformed blood lead levels are used to 
predict changes in IQ score).  The single linear model implies that the magnitude 
of change in IQ is constant over the entire range of blood lead levels.  Therefore, 
at lower blood lead levels, the log-linear model predicts larger changes in IQ than 
the linear model.  Note that CASAC, in their review of EPA’s Lead Risk 
Assessment indicated that “studies show that the decrements in intellectual 
(cognitive) functions in children are proportionately greater at PbB concentrations 
<10 μg/dl” (USEPA, 2007d, page 3).  However, if the true dose-response 
relationship is linear, than our primary estimate of benefits is an overestimation.
· Some uncertainty is involved in the estimates of maximum quarterly mean lead 
air concentrations used for the benefits model.  We used ratios of second 
maximum monthly mean values to maximum quarterly mean values from lead 
monitoring data from 2003-2005 to convert the baseline second maximum 
monthly mean values in 2020 into maximum quarterly mean for the “base case” 
as well as to convert the alternative second maximum monthly mean NAAQS into 
a maximum quarterly mean for the “control scenarios.”  If the true ratio between 
the second maximum monthly means to the maximum quarterly mean is different 
in 2020 than in 2003-2005 because the pattern and distribution of daily values 
differs, then our results could be either over- or underestimated.
· The interpolation method of estimating exposure concentrations that we used for 
our primary estimate is associated with some uncertainty.  The validity of this 
method is to some extent contingent upon the availability of a sufficient number 
of monitors to support an interpolation. In certain locations, such as Hillsborough 
County, FL, there are a sufficient number of lead and TSP monitors to generate an 
interpolation with a pronounced gradient around each monitor.  The lead and TSP 
monitoring network in other non-attainment areas can in some cases be sparse, 
and the resulting interpolation does not appear to generate a meaningful gradient, 
such as in Delaware County, IN.
 7-8
· The application of the monitor rollback technique to estimate full attainment air 
quality changes benefits introduces some uncertainty to the analysis.  This 
technique simulates the air quality change associated with an emissions control 
strategy that is capable of just attaining each standard alternative at each monitor.  
This approach to estimating air quality changes is different from the reduced-form 
air quality model employed to develop the emissions control strategy.  When 
utilizing this reduced-form model to identify control strategies for each standard 
alternative, in certain cases emission controls achieved reductions in ambient lead 
below the standard alternative under analysis,. In other cases, the modeled control 
strategies were insufficient to model full attainment with all monitors.  The 
monitor rollback approach used to estimate full attainment benefits does not 
reflect this variability in attainment status, because it adjusts the violating monitor 
value down to, but not below, the standard alternative.  Thus, where the control 
strategy attains air quality improvements below the standard at violating monitors, 
the monitor rollback approach will not reflect the additional benefits associated 
with this air quality improvement.  Conversely, where the control strategy does 
not fully attain the standard alternative at a given monitor, the rollback technique 
would overstate benefits because it adjusts the monitor value all the way down to 
the standard, below a level actually achieved by the control strategy.
The estimation of the population to which the benefits apply when using the 
radius method of exposure estimation is uncertain.  First, we assumed that the 
population within each census block group is uniformly distributed, and therefore, 
that the fraction of the block group geographically that overlapped with the radius 
corresponded to the fraction of the population living within the radius.  In 
addition, we used 2000 Census data to calculate the population living within each 
radius and distributed it into five-year age groups by gender using the 2000 
Census data for the county in which the monitor resides.  We assumed that block 
groups falling inside the radius that reside in neighboring counties had the same 
age and gender distributions as the county in which the monitor resides.  If these 
assumptions are inaccurate, the benefits results could potentially be under- or 
overestimated.
· We assumed that the IQ point effects of a change in concurrent blood lead (i.e., 
the effects of a change in 2020) apply to all children in our study population that 
were under seven years of age in 2020.  If there is a critical window of exposure 
for IQ effects (e.g., between the ages of one and two), then we could potentially 
be overestimating benefits in 2020 because we would have overestimated the 
population affected by reduced lead exposure in that year.  However, if partial or 
full achievement of the alternative NAAQS levels might occur earlier than 2020, 
the children in our 0-6 age cohort who are past any critical window in 2020 would 
have realized the partial or full benefits of reduced lead exposures in those earlier 
years.  Thus, the issue of a potential critical developmental window reflects 
uncertainty in both the timing and size of benefits.
· The use of air:blood ratios represents a first approximation to the impact of 
changes in ambient air concentrations of lead on concurrent blood lead levels, 
applied in the absence of modeling data on lead transport and deposition and the 
 7-9
on direct and indirect human exposures.  While the values we apply match fairly 
well with available literature, there are relatively few studies that report such 
values or provide sufficient data to calculate such ratios.  Further, the lead 
concentrations in those studies tend to be higher than those modeled here (EPA, 
2007a); thus uncertainty remains as to whether the same ratios would be expected 
at lower levels, or whether air exposures are more or less efficient at changing 
concurrent blood lead levels at these lower concentrations.
· If the air:blood ratio we apply for children or a similar value is also valid for 
estimating adult exposures, then our primary benefits understate the true health 
benefits accruing to the lead-exposed populations because they exclude impacts 
on morbidity and mortality impacts on adults as well as impacts on prenatal 
mortality.  Additional research is needed to improve our understanding of the 
impacts of adult air exposure on adult blood lead levels.
· The earnings-based value-per-IQ-point lost that we apply in this analysis most 
likely represents a lower bound on the true value of a lost IQ point, because it is 
essentially a cost-of-illness measure, not a measure of an individual’s willingness-
to-pay (WTP) to avoid the loss of an IQ point.  Welfare economics emphasizes 
WTP measures as the more complete estimate of economic value; for example, 
the earnings-based value does not include losses in utility due to pain and 
suffering, nor does it assess the costs of averting behaviors that may be 
undertaken by households to avoid or mitigate IQ loss from lead exposure.
· The earnings-based estimate of the value-per-IQ-point lost is based on current 
data on labor-force participation rates, survival probabilities, and assumptions 
about educational costs and real wage growth in the future.  To the extent these 
factors diverge from these values in the future, our lifetime earnings estimate may 
be under- or overestimated.  Another factor suggesting that our lifetime earnings 
estimate may be an underestimate is that it does not account for the value of 
productive services occurring outside the labor force (e.g., child rearing and 
housework).
· Because of the relatively strong relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and 
premature mortality, PM co-benefits resulting from reductions in fine particulate 
emissions can make up a large fraction of total monetized benefits, depending on 
the specific PM mortality impact function used, and to a lesser extend on the 
relative magnitude of direct lead benefits.  The lower end of the range assumes 
PM2.5 benefits are based on the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship 
provided by Expert K; the upper end of the range assumes the relationship 
provided by Expert E.  The relative share of co-control to primary lead benefits 
varies only modestly across the four alternative standards.
· Co-control benefits estimated here reflect the application of a national dollar 
benefit per ton estimate of the benefits of reducing directly emitted fine 
particulates from point sources.  Because they are based on national-level 
analysis, the benefit-per-ton estimates used here do not reflect local meteorology, 
 7-10
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to 
an over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly 
emitted fine particulates.  
7.3 Conclusions and Insights
EPA’s analysis has estimated the benefits of reductions in ambient concentrations of lead 
resulting from a set of illustrative control strategies to reduce emissions of lead at point sources.  
The results suggest there will be significant additional benefits arising from reducing emissions 
from a variety of sources in and around projected nonattaining counties in 2020.  While 2020 is 
the latest date by which states would generally need to demonstrate attainment with the revised 
standards, it is expected that benefits (and costs) will begin occurring earlier, as states begin 
implementing control measures to show progress towards attainment.
There are several important factors to consider when evaluating the relative benefits and 
costs of the attainment strategies for the four alternative standards assessed in this RIA:
· Our estimates of costs of attainment in 2020 assume a particular trajectory of
what might be aggressive technological change.  This trajectory leads to a 
particular level of emissions reductions and costs which we have estimated based 
on costs of identified controls.  An alternative storyline might hypothesize a much 
less optimistic technological change path, such that emissions reductions 
technologies for industrial sources would be more expensive or would be 
unavailable, so that emissions reductions from many smaller sources might be 
required for 2020 attainment, at a potentially greater cost per ton.  Under this 
alternative storyline, two outcomes are hypothetically possible: Under one 
scenario, total costs associated with full attainment might be substantially higher. 
Under the second scenario, states may choose to take advantage of flexibility in 
the Clean Air Act to adopt plans with later attainment dates to allow for additional 
technologies to be developed and for other programs be fully implemented.  If 
states were to submit plans with attainment dates beyond our 2020 analysis year, 
benefits would clearly be lower than we have estimated under our analytical 
storyline.  However, in this case, state decision makers, seeking to maximize 
economic efficiency, would not impose costs, including potential opportunity 
costs of not meeting their attainment date, when they exceed the expected health 
benefits that states would realize from meeting their modeled 2020 attainment 
date.  In this case, upper bound costs are difficult to estimate because we do not 
have an estimate of the point where marginal costs are equal to marginal benefits 
plus the costs of nonattainment.
· Benefits and costs are distributed differently across potential non-attainment 
counties.  As presented in Chapter 5, most of the primary lead benefits of the 
standards are expected to be realized in a small number of areas.  These are areas 
where the sources of lead exposure and the monitors that measure ambient lead 
appear to be in relatively close proximity to exposed populations.  The identified 
 7-11
control costs, on the other hand, are greatest in those areas with the largest sources 
of lead emissions - usually around primary or secondary lead smelters, mining 
operations, or battery manufacturers.  PM co-control benefits tend to be 
distributed in better correlation to control costs.  In general, PM co-control 
benefits tend to be highest in those areas where our attainment strategy suggests 
controls on combustion sources, rather than metals processing, are necessary.
· Our analysis considers controls on point source emissions only. Local areas 
might find that controls of area sources would be more cost-effective or better 
demonstrated than the point source controls we model.  In addition, at this time 
we have not considered whether Federal action might reduce the contribution of 
leaded aviation gasoline to local lead concentrations, particularly in areas where 
we find it difficult or impossible to reach attainment based on point sources 
controls alone.
· Because of the limitations and uncertainties in the emissions and air quality 
components of our assessment, the specific control strategies that might be the 
most effective in helping areas to reach attainment are still very uncertain.  For 
example, we employ a fairly simple distance-weighted dispersion approach to 
approximate the effect of controls on specific point sources in reducing 
concentrations at current monitor locations.  
· Similar to the recent ozone and PM NAAQS RIAs, our analysis sets a 98th 
percentile cost per ton limit for the source-specific cost-effectiveness of controls
to be employed to reach attainment.  However, we also apply a controls 
application optimization algorithm that effectively uses a cost per microgram 
ranking in modeling attainment strategies.  Our approach provides greater 
confidence that, within the significant uncertainties presented by application of a 
large complement of unidentified controls and the simplified air quality 
estimation procedure, our modeled attainment strategies reflect a least-cost 
approach that could be feasible for local areas to implement in pursuing 
attainment with a significantly lower lead NAAQS than the current standard.
As part of the development of the final RIA, EPA has activities underway to make 
improvements to both cost and benefit calculations, recognizing that there will remain significant 
data gaps and uncertainties.   As outlined above and in the individual chapters, we plan to 
investigate changes which will: better match locations of monitors and sources, refine our 
estimates of population exposures, broaden the number of concentration-response functions in 
the primary analysis, improve our estimates of emission reductions due to known controls, and 
improve the comparability of the costs and benefits.

CHAPTER 8. STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE ORDER REVIEWS
8.1. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review
Under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order (EO) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), 
this action is an “economically significant regulatory action” because it is likely to have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.  Accordingly, EPA submitted the 
proposed lead NAAQS revisions to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review 
under EO 12866 and any changes made in response to OMB recommendations have been 
documented in the docket for this action (EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0735).  In addition, EPA 
prepared this Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the potential costs and benefits associated 
with this action.  This RIA and related material is available for public review in docket EPA-HQ-
OAR-2008-0253.   
The RIA estimates the costs and monetized human health and welfare benefits of 
attaining four alternative Pb NAAQS nationwide.  Specifically, the RIA examines the 
alternatives of 0.30 μg/m3, 0.20 μg/m3, 0.10 μg/m3 and 0.05 μg/m3.  The RIA contains illustrative 
analyses that consider a limited number of emissions control scenarios that States and Regional 
Planning Organizations might implement to achieve these alternative Pb NAAQS.  However, the 
CAA and judicial decisions make clear that the economic and technical feasibility of attaining 
ambient standards are not to be considered in setting or revising NAAQS, although such factors 
may be considered in the development of State plans to implement the standards.  Accordingly, 
although this RIA has been prepared, the results of the RIA have not been considered in issuing 
the proposed rule.
8.2. Paperwork Reduction Act
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for 
approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.  The Information Collection Request (ICR) document prepared by EPA 
for these proposed revisions to part 58 has been assigned EPA ICR numbers 0940.21.
The information collected under 40 CFR part 53 (e.g., test results, monitoring records, 
instruction manual, and other associated information) is needed to determine whether a candidate 
method intended for use in determining attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) in 40 CFR part 50 will meet the design, performance, and/or comparability 
requirements for designation as a Federal reference method (FRM) or Federal equivalent method 
(FEM).  While this proposed rule amends the requirements for Pb FRM and FEM 
determinations, they merely provide additional flexibility in meeting the FRM/FEM 
determination requirements.  Furthermore, we do not expect the number of FRM or FEM 
determinations to increase over the number that is currently used to estimate burden associated 
with Pb FRM/FEM determinations provided in the current ICR for 40 CFR part 53 (EPA ICR 
numbers  0559.12).  As such, no change in the burden estimate for 40 CFR part 53 has been 
made as part of this rulemaking. 
 8-2
The information collected and reported under 40 CFR part 58 is needed to determine 
compliance with the NAAQS, to characterize air quality and associated health and ecosystem 
impacts, to develop emissions control strategies, and to measure progress for the air pollution 
program.  The proposed amendments would revise the technical requirements for Pb monitoring 
sites, require the siting and operation of additional Pb ambient air monitors, and the reporting of 
the collected ambient Pb monitoring data to EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS).  Because this 
rulemaking includes a range of proposals for the level and averaging time, it is not possible 
accurately predict the size of the final network, and its associated burden.  Rather we have 
estimated the upper range of burden possible based on the regulatory options being proposed 
which would result in a higher reporting burden (i.e., a final level for the standard of 0.1 µg/m3
with a 2nd maximum monthly averaging form).  Based on these assumptions, the annual average 
reporting burden for the collection under 40 CFR part 58 (averaged over the first 3 years of this 
ICR) for 150 respondents is estimated to increase by a total of 96,080 labor hours per year with 
an increase of $6,775,022 per year.  Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).  State, local, and 
tribal entities are eligible for State assistance grants provided by the Federal government under 
the CAA which can be used for monitors and related activities.
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.  The OMB 
control numbers for EPA's regulations in 40 CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9.  
8.3. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency 
certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities.  Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions.
For purposes of assessing the impacts of this rule on small entities, small entity is defined 
as:  (1) a small business that is a small industrial entity as defined by the Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201;  (2) a small governmental jurisdiction 
that is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of 
less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is 
independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.
After considering the economic impacts of this proposed rule on small entities, I certify 
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.  This proposed rule will not impose any requirements on small entities.  Rather, this rule 
establishes national standards for allowable concentrations of Pb in ambient air as required by 
section 109 of the CAA.  American Trucking Ass’ns v. EPA, 175 F. 3d 1027, 1044-45 (D.C. cir. 
1999) (NAAQS do not have significant impacts upon small entities because NAAQS themselves 
impose no regulations upon small entities). Similarly, the proposed amendments to 40 CFR part 
58 address the requirements for States to collect information and report compliance with the 
NAAQS and will not impose any requirements on small entities.  We continue to be interested in 
 8-3
the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small entities and welcome comments on issues 
related to such impacts.
8.4. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), Public Law 104-4, 
establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on 
State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector.  Unless otherwise prohibited by law, 
under section 202 of the UMRA, EPA generally must prepare a written statement, including a 
cost-benefit analysis, for proposed and final rules with “Federal mandates” that may result in 
expenditures to State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, of 
$100 million or more in any one year.  Before promulgating an EPA rule for which a written 
statement is required under section 202, section 205 of the UMRA generally requires EPA to 
identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and to adopt the least costly, 
most cost-effective or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule.  The 
provisions of section 205 do not apply when they are inconsistent with applicable law.  
Moreover, section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the least costly, most cost-
effective or least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes with the final rule an 
explanation why that alternative was not adopted.  Before EPA establishes any regulatory 
requirements that may significantly or uniquely affect small governments, including tribal 
governments, it must have developed under section 203 of the UMRA a small government 
agency plan.  The plan must provide for notifying potentially affected small governments, 
enabling officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely input in the 
development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant Federal intergovernmental mandates, 
and informing, educating, and advising small governments on compliance with the regulatory 
requirements. 
This action is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of the UMRA.  
EPA has determined that this proposed rule does not contain a Federal mandate that may result in 
expenditures of $100 million or more for State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or the private sector in any one year.  The revisions to the Pb NAAQS impose no enforceable 
duty on any State, local or Tribal governments or the private sector.  The expected costs 
associated with the increased monitoring requirements are described in EPA’s ICR document, 
but those costs are not expected to exceed $100 million in the aggregate for any year.  
Furthermore, as indicated previously, in setting a NAAQS EPA cannot consider the economic or 
technological feasibility of attaining ambient air quality standards.  Because the Clean Air Act 
prohibits EPA from considering the types of estimates and assessments described in section 202 
when setting the NAAQS, the UMRA does not require EPA to prepare a written statement under 
section 202 for the revisions to the Pb NAAQS. 
With regard to implementation guidance, the CAA imposes the obligation for States to 
submit SIPs to implement the Pb NAAQS. In this proposed rule, EPA is merely providing an 
interpretation of those requirements. However, even if this rule did establish an independent 
obligation for States to submit SIPs, it is questionable whether an obligation to submit a SIP 
revision would constitute a Federal mandate in any case. The obligation for a State to submit a 
SIP that arises out of section 110 and section 191 of the CAA is not legally enforceable by a 
 8-4
court of law, and at most is a condition for continued receipt of highway funds. Therefore, it is 
possible to view an action requiring such a submittal as not creating any enforceable duty within 
the meaning of 2 U.S.C. 658 for purposes of the UMRA. Even if it did, the duty could be viewed 
as falling within the exception for a condition of Federal assistance under 2 U.S.C. 658.
EPA has determined that this proposed rule contains no regulatory requirements that 
might significantly or uniquely affect small governments because it imposes no enforceable duty 
on any small governments.  Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of section 203 
of the UMRA.
8.5. Executive Order 13132: Federalism
Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires 
EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by State and 
local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.”  
“Policies that have federalism implications” is defined in the Executive Order to include 
regulations that have “substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among 
the various levels of government.”  
This proposed rule does not have federalism implications.  It will not have substantial 
direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, 
or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as 
specified in Executive Order 13132.  The rule does not alter the relationship between the Federal 
government and the States regarding the establishment and implementation of air quality 
improvement programs as codified in the CAA.  Under section 109 of the CAA, EPA is 
mandated to establish NAAQS; however, CAA section 116 preserves the rights of States to 
establish more stringent requirements if deemed necessary by a State.  Furthermore, this rule 
does not impact CAA section 107 which establishes that the States have primary responsibility 
for implementation of the NAAQS.  Finally, as noted in section E (above) on UMRA, this rule 
does not impose significant costs on State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector.  
Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule.
8.6. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments
Executive Order 13175, entitled “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments” (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), requires EPA to develop an accountable 
process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of 
regulatory policies that have tribal implications.”  This proposed rule does not have tribal 
implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175.  It does not have a substantial direct effect 
on one or more Indian Tribes, since Tribes are not obligated to adopt or implement any NAAQS.  
Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this rule.  
 8-5
8.7. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children from Environmental Health & 
Safety Risks
This action is subject to EO (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is an economically 
significant regulatory action as defined by EO 12866, and we believe that the environmental 
health risk addressed by this action has a disproportionate effect on children. The proposed rule 
will establish uniform national ambient air quality standards for Pb; these standards are designed 
to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety, as required by CAA section 109.  
However, the protection offered by these standards may be especially important for children 
because neurological effects in children are among if not the most sensitive health endpoints for 
Pb exposure.  Because children are considered a sensitive population, we have carefully 
evaluated the environmental health effects of exposure to Pb pollution among children.  These 
effects and the size of the population affected are summarized in chapters 6 and 8 of the Criteria 
Document and sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the Staff Paper, and the results of our evaluation of the 
effects of Pb pollution on children are discussed in sections II.B and II.C of the preamble to the 
proposed rule.
8.8. Executive Order 13211: Actions that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution or Use
This rule is not a “significant energy action” as defined in Executive Order 13211, 
“Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use” 
(66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)) because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy.  The purpose of this rule is to establish revised NAAQS for 
Pb.  The rule does not prescribe specific control strategies by which these ambient standards will 
be met.  Such strategies will be developed by States on a case-by-case basis, and EPA cannot 
predict whether the control options selected by States will include regulations on energy 
suppliers, distributors, or users.  Thus, EPA concludes that this rule is not likely to have any 
adverse energy effects.
8.9. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act
Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 
(NTTAA), Public Law No. 104-113, §12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary 
consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with 
applicable law or otherwise impractical.  Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards 
(e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are 
developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.  The NTTAA directs EPA to 
provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and 
applicable voluntary consensus standards.
This proposed rulemaking involves technical standards.  EPA proposes to use low-
volume PM10 samplers coupled with XRF analysis as the FRM for Pb-PM10 measurement.  
While EPA identified the ISO standard “Determination of the particulate lead content of aerosols 
collected on filters” (ISO 9855: 1993) as being potentially applicable, we do not propose to use it 
 8-6
in this rule.  The use of this voluntary consensus standard would be impractical because the 
analysis method does not provide for the method detection limits necessary to adequately 
characterize ambient Pb concentrations for the purpose of determining compliance with the 
proposed revisions to the Pb NAAQS.  
8.10. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in 
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations
Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629; Feb. 16, 1994) establishes federal executive policy 
on environmental justice.  Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent 
practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by 
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-
income populations in the United States.  
EPA has determined that this proposed rule will not have disproportionately high and 
adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it 
increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any 
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, 
including any minority or low-income population.  The proposed rule will establish uniform 
national standards for Pb in ambient air.
EPA is continuing to assess the impact of Pb air pollution on minority and low- income 
populations, and plans to prepare a technical memo as part of its assessment to be placed in the 
docket by the date of publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.
