§ 440.345 EPSDT services requirement. 
(a) The State must assure access to 
early and periodic screening, diagnostic 
and treatment (EPSDT) services through 
benchmark or benchmark-equivalent 
plan benefits or as wrap-around benefits 
to those plans for any child under 19 
years of age eligible in a category under 
the State plan. 
(1) Sufficiency: Any wrap-around 
EPSDT benefits must be sufficient so 
that, in combination with the 
benchmark or benchmark-equivalent 
benefits plan, these individuals have 
access to the full EPSDT benefit. 
(2) State Plan requirement: The State 
must include a description of how the 
wrap-around benefits will be provided 
to ensure that these recipients have 
access to the full EPSDT benefit. 
(b) Individuals must first seek 
coverage of EPSDT services through the 
benchmark or benchmark equivalent 
plan before seeking coverage of such 
through wrap-around benefits. 
§ 440.350 Employer-sponsored insurance 
health plans. 
(a) A State may provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage by 
obtaining employer sponsored health 
plans (either alone or with the addition 
of wrap-around services covered 
separately under Medicaid) for 
individuals with access to private health 
insurance. 
(b) The State must assure that 
employer sponsored plans meet the 
requirements of benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage, 
including the cost-effectiveness 
requirements at § 440.370. 
(c) A State may provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage through 
a combination of employer sponsored 
health plans and additional benefit 
coverage provided by the State that 
wraps around the employer sponsored 
health plan which, in the aggregate, 
results in benchmark or benchmark- 
equivalent level of coverage for those 
recipients. 
§ 440.355 Payment of premiums. 
Payment of premiums by the State, 
net of beneficiary contributions, to 
obtain benchmark or benchmark- 
equivalent benefit coverage on behalf of 
beneficiaries under this section will be 
treated as medical assistance under 
section 1905(a) of the Act. 
§ 440.360 State plan requirement for 
providing additional wrap-around services. 
If the State opts to provide additional 
or wrap-around coverage to individuals 
enrolled in benchmark or benchmark- 
equivalent plans, the State plan must 
describe the populations covered and 
the payment methodology for these 
services. Additional or wrap-around 
services must be in categories that are 
within the scope of the benchmark 
coverage, or are described in section 
1905(a) of the Act. 
§ 440.365 Coverage of rural health clinic 
and federally qualified health center (FQHC) 
services. 
If a State provides benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage to 
individuals, it must assure that the 
individual has access, through that 
coverage or otherwise, to rural health 
clinic services and FQHC services as 
defined in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of 
section 1905(a)(2) of the Act. Payment 
for these services must be made in 
accordance with the payment provisions 
of section 1902(bb) of the Act. 
§ 440.370 Cost-effectiveness. 
Benchmark and benchmark- 
equivalent coverage and any additional 
benefits must be provided in accordance 
with Federal upper payment limits, 
procurement requirements and other 
economy and efficiency principles that 
would otherwise be applicable to the 
services or delivery system through 
which the coverage and benefits are 
obtained. 
§ 440.375 Comparability. 
States have the option to amend their 
State plan to provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage to 
recipients without regard to 
comparability. 
§ 440.380 Statewideness. 
States have the option to amend their 
State plan to provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage to 
recipients without regard to 
statewideness. 
§ 440.385 Freedom of choice. 
(a) States have the option to amend 
their State plan to provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage to 
recipients without regard to the 
requirements for free choice of provider 
in § 431.51 of this chapter. 
(b) States may restrict recipients to 
obtaining services from (or through) 
selectively procured provider plans or 
practitioners that meet, accept, and 
comply with reimbursement, quality 
and utilization standards under the 
State Plan, to the extent that the 
restrictions imposed meet the following 
requirements: 
(1) Do not discriminate among classes 
of providers on grounds unrelated to 
their demonstrated effectiveness and 
efficiency in providing the benchmark 
benefit package. 
(2) Do not apply in emergency 
circumstances. 
(3) Require that all provider plans are 
paid on a timely basis in the same 
manner as health care practitioners 
must be paid under § 447.45 of the 
chapter. 
§ 440.390 Assurance of Transportation. 
A State may at its option amend its 
State plan to provide benchmark or 
benchmark-equivalent coverage to 
recipients without regard to the 
assurance of transportation to medically 
necessary services requirement 
specified in § 431.53 of this chapter.

I. Background 
A. General 
For more than a decade, States have 
been asking for the tools to modernize 
their Medicaid programs. With the 
enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act 
of 2005 (DRA) (Pub. L. 109–171, enacted 
on February 8, 2006), States now have 
new options to create programs that are 
aligned with today’s Medicaid 
populations and the health care 
environment. Alternative cost sharing, 
benefit flexibility through benchmark 
plans, and the health opportunity 
accounts (HOA) demonstration provide 
the greatest opportunities to modernize 
Medicaid, to make the cost of the 
program and health care more 
affordable, and to expand coverage for 
the uninsured. States will be able to 
reconnect families to the larger 
insurance system that serves most 
Americans and promote continuity of 
coverage. The sweeping DRA provisions 
on Medicaid include six chapters and 
39 sections. Through a combination of 
new options for States and new 
requirements related to program 
integrity, the DRA will help ensure the 
sustainability of the Medicaid program 
over time. 
B. Statutory Authority 
Sections 6041, 6042, and 6043 of the 
DRA established a new section 1916A of 
the Social Security Act (the Act). 
Section 405(a)(1) of the Tax Relief and 
Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) (Pub. 
L. 109–432, enacted on December 20, 
2006) modified section 1916A of the 
Act. Section 1916A sets forth options for 
alternative premiums and cost sharing, 
including options for higher cost 
sharing for non-preferred prescription 
drugs and for non-emergency use of a 
hospital emergency room. 
Section 6041 of the DRA established 
new subsections 1916A(a) and (b), of the 
Act, which allow States to amend their 
State plans to impose alternative 
premiums and cost sharing on certain 
groups of individuals, for items and 
services other than drugs (which are 
subject to a separate provision discussed 
below), and to enforce payment of the 
premiums and cost sharing. Subsections 
1916A(a) and (b) set forth limitations on 
alternative premiums and cost-sharing 
that vary based on family income, and 
exclude some specific services from 
alternative cost sharing. Section 6041 
also created a new section 1916(h) of the 
Act, which requires the Secretary to 
increase the ‘‘nominal’’ cost sharing 
amounts under section 1916 for each 
year (beginning with 2006) by the 
annual percentage increase in the 
medical care component of the 
consumer price index for all urban 
consumers (CPI–U) as rounded up in an 
appropriate manner. Section 405(a)(1) of 
the TRHCA modified subsections 
1916A(a) and (b) of the Act. 
Section 6042 of the DRA created 
section 1916A(c) of the Act, which 
provides States with additional options 
for establishing cost sharing 
requirements for drugs to encourage the 
use of preferred drugs. Section 405(a)(1) 
of the TRHCA also modified section 
1916A(c) of the Act. Under section

9729 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 36 / Friday, February 22, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
1916A(c), States may amend their State 
plans to require increased cost sharing 
by certain groups of individuals for non- 
preferred drugs and to waive or reduce 
the otherwise applicable cost sharing for 
preferred drugs. States may also permit 
pharmacy providers to require the 
receipt of a cost sharing payment from 
an individual before filling a 
prescription. We believe the Congress 
intended to provide additional 
flexibilities to States in issuing the DRA. 
Thus, we have not defined preferred 
drugs or non-preferred drugs within a 
class of such drugs in this rule and we 
believe defining these terms should be 
at State discretion. We would anticipate 
that States would publish schedules of 
preferred drugs as part of, or as a 
supplement to, the required public 
schedule of cost sharing under 42 CFR 
447.76. 
Section 6043 of the DRA created 
section 1916A(e) of the Act, which 
permits States to amend their State 
plans to allow hospitals, after an 
appropriate medical screening 
examination under section 1867 
(EMTALA) of the Act, to impose higher 
cost sharing upon certain groups of 
individuals for non-emergency care or 
services furnished in a hospital 
emergency department. Section 
405(a)(1) of the TRHCA modified 
section 1916A(e) of the Act. Under this 
option, if the hospital determines that 
an individual does not have an 
emergency medical condition, before 
providing the non-emergency services 
and imposing cost sharing, it must 
inform the individual that an available 
and accessible alternate non-emergency 
services provider can provide the 
services without the imposition of the 
same cost sharing and that the hospital 
can coordinate a referral to that 
provider. After notice is given, the 
hospital may require payment of the 
cost sharing before providing the non- 
emergency services to the individual. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘PROVISIONS OF THE 
PROPOSED REGULATIONS’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
A. Overview 
The Department began issuing 
guidance about the new flexibilities 
available to States within months of the 
enactment of the DRA. We released two 
letters to State Medicaid directors and 
health officials providing guidance on 
sections 6041, 6042 and 6043 of the 
DRA, and section 405(a)(1) of the 
TRHCA as it relates to sections 6041 and 
6042 of the DRA respectively. States and 
Territories have used this guidance to 
design and implement the new options. 
These regulations formalize the 
guidance on alternative premiums and 
cost sharing. 
These proposed regulations would 
amend existing Medicaid cost sharing 
regulations at 42 CFR part 447 and State 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(SCHIP) cost sharing regulations at 42 
CFR part 457. We propose this approach 
to assist the reader in easily accessing 
all Medicaid and SCHIP cost sharing 
regulations. 
B. Medicaid Regulations 
1. Maximum Allowable Charges 
(§ 447.54) 
We are proposing to revise § 447.54 to 
update the existing ‘‘nominal’’ Medicaid 
cost sharing amounts, specifically the 
nominal deductible amount described at 
§ 447.54(a)(1) and the nominal 
copayment amounts described at 
§ 447.54(a)(3). We are also proposing to 
add § 447.54(a)(4) to establish a 
maximum copayment amount for 
services provided by a managed care 
organization (MCO). 
Section 6041(b)(2) of the DRA 
requires the Secretary to increase the 
nominal cost sharing amounts under 
section 1916 of the Act for each year 
(beginning with 2006) by the annual 
percentage increase in the medical care 
component of the consumer price index 
for all urban consumers (U.S. city 
average) as rounded up in an 
appropriate manner. In accordance with 
the statute, we propose to increase the 
nominal amounts on the beginning of 
the Federal Fiscal Year (FY) (October 1) 
in each calendar year by the percentage 
increase in the medical care component 
of the Consumer Price Index for All 
Urban Consumers (CPI–U) for the period 
of September to September ending in 
the preceding calendar year. We use this 
period to update other amounts, such as 
the Medicaid spousal impoverishment 
standards, by inflation. The first 
adjustment would be for FY 2007, and 
would be based on the CPI–U increases 
during the period September 2004 to 
September 2005. The medical care 
component of the CPI–U increased by 
3.9 percent between September 2004 
and September 2005, so we propose to 
update the nominal amounts by that 
factor and then round to the next higher 
10-cent increment. We propose to round 
to the next higher 10-cent increment 
because it will simplify calculation and 
collection of the amounts involved. 
Based on this methodology, we propose 
a maximum deductible for $2.10 per 
month per family for each period of 
Medicaid eligibility. In addition, we 
propose the following copayment 
maximum amounts: 
State payment for the service Maximum copayment 
$10 or less ................................ $ .60 
$10.01 to $25 ........................... 1.10 
$25.01 to $50 ........................... 2.10 
$50.01 or more ......................... 3.20 
States should use these updated 
nominal amounts during FY 2007. 
Thereafter, these amounts will be 
updated each October 1 by the 
percentage increase in the medical care 
component of the CPI–U for the period 
of September to September ending in 
the preceding year, rounded to the next 
higher 10-cent increment. 
In addition, we have proposed to 
specify a maximum copayment amount 
for services provided by an MCO. When 
we published the final Medicaid 
managed care rules on June 14, 2002 (67 
FR 40989), we also issued at § 447.60, a 
requirement that contracts with MCOs 
limit cost sharing charges an MCO may 
impose on Medicaid enrollees to the 
amounts that could be imposed if fee- 
for-service payment rates were 
applicable. Since some States do not 
have fee-for-service programs, we have 
proposed to specify maximum 
copayment amounts for services 
provided by an MCO. 
2. Premiums and Cost Sharing: Basis, 
Purpose and Scope (§ 447.62) 
Section 1916A of the Act allows 
States to impose alternative premiums 
and cost sharing that are not subject to 
the limitations on premiums and cost 
sharing under section 1916 of the Act. 
Section 1916A of the Act does not affect 
the Secretary’s existing waiver authority 
with regard to premiums and cost 
sharing. Section 447.62 of the 
regulations briefly describes this 
statutory provision which is the basis 
for § 447.64 through § 447.82. Section 
447.62 also sets forth limitations on the 
scope of these regulations by indicating 
that they do not limit the Secretary’s 
waiver authority, or affect existing 
waivers, concerning premiums or cost 
sharing. 
Section 405(a)(1) of the TRHCA 
amended section 1916A by explicitly 
providing certain exemptions from the 
provisions, and other protections, for 
the population with family incomes at 
or below 100 percent of the FPL. The 
statute also includes protections for 
individuals with family incomes 
between 100 and 150 percent of the FPL 
and individuals with family incomes 
above 150 percent of the FPL.

3. Premiums, Enrollment Fees, or 
Similar Fees: State Plan Requirements 
(§ 447.64) 
Section 1916A(a)(1) of the Act 
requires that the State plan specify the 
group or groups of individuals upon 
which it will impose alternate 
premiums. In accordance with the 
statute, at § 447.64(a), we propose that 
the State plan describe the group or 
groups of individuals that may be 
subject to such premiums, enrollment 
fees, or similar charges. For example, 
States may impose premiums upon all 
non-exempt childless adults (with 
family incomes over 150 percent of the 
FPL). We further propose in § 447.64(b) 
that the State plan must include a 
schedule of the premiums, enrollment 
fees, or similar charges and the process 
for informing recipients, applicants, 
providers, and the public of the 
schedule. States may vary the 
premiums, enrollment fees, or similar 
charges among the groups of 
individuals. 
Section 1916A(b)(4) of the Act 
requires that the State plan specify the 
manner and the period for which the 
State determines family income. In 
accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.64(c), we propose that the State 
plan describe the methodology used to 
determine family income, including the 
period and periodicity of those 
determinations. We also propose in 
§ 447.64(d) that the State plan describe 
the methodology the State will use to 
ensure that the aggregate amount of 
premiums and cost sharing imposed for 
all individuals in the family does not 
exceed 5 percent of family income as 
applied during the monthly or quarterly 
period specified by the State. 
Section 1916A(d)(1) of the Act 
requires that the State specify the group 
or group of individuals for whom 
payment of premiums is a condition of 
eligibility. In accordance with the 
statute, at § 447.64(e), we propose that 
the State plan, list the group or groups 
of individuals. We further propose in 
§ 447.64(f) that the State plan describe 
the premium payment terms for the 
group or groups. 
4. General Premium Protections 
(§ 447.66) 
Under section 1916A(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act, the State plan may not impose 
premiums upon the following: 
• Individuals under 18 years of age 
who are required to be provided 
medical assistance under section 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, and 
including individuals with respect to 
whom child welfare services are made 
available under Part B of title IV on the 
basis of being a child in foster care and 
individuals with respect to whom 
adoption or foster care assistance is 
made available under part E of that title, 
without regard to age; 
• Pregnant women; 
• Any terminally ill individual 
receiving hospice care, as defined in 
section 1905(o) of the Act; 
• Any individual who is an inpatient 
in a hospital, nursing facility, 
intermediate care facility, or other 
medical institution, if the individual is 
required, as a condition of receiving 
services in that institution under the 
State plan, to spend for costs of medical 
care all but a minimal amount of the 
individual’s income required for 
personal needs; 
• Women who are receiving Medicaid 
on the basis of the breast or cervical 
cancer eligibility group under sections 
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII) and 1902(aa) of 
the Act; and 
• Disabled children who are receiving 
medical assistance by virtue of the 
application of sections 
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) and 1902(cc) of 
the Act. 
In accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.66(a), we propose that the State 
exclude these classes of individuals 
from the imposition of premiums. 
Section 1916A(b)(3)(C) of the Act 
clarifies that a State may exempt 
additional classes of individuals from 
premiums. At proposed § 447.66(b), we 
would implement this section. 
5. Copayments, Coinsurance, 
Deductibles, or Similar Cost Sharing 
Charges: State Plan Requirements 
(§ 447.68) 
Section 1916A(a)(1) of the Act 
requires that the State plan specify the 
group or groups of individuals upon 
which it opts to impose cost sharing. In 
accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.68(a), we propose that the State 
plan describe the group or groups of 
individuals that may be subject to cost 
sharing. For example, States may 
impose cost sharing for non-exempt 
items and services to individuals in the 
section 1931 eligibility group with 
family incomes between 100 and 200 
percent of the FPL. We further propose 
that the State plan must include a 
schedule of the copayments, 
coinsurance, deductibles, or similar cost 
sharing charges, the items or services for 
which the charges apply, and the 
process for informing recipients, 
applicants, providers, and the public of 
the schedule. States may vary cost 
sharing among the types of items and 
services. 
Section 1916A(b)(4) of the Act 
requires that the State plan specify the 
manner and the period for which the 
State determines family income. In 
accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.68(b), we propose that the State 
plan describe the methodology used to 
determine family income, including the 
period and periodicity of such 
determinations. 
We also propose that the State plan 
describe the methodology the State will 
use to ensure that the aggregate amount 
of premiums and cost sharing imposed 
for all individuals in the family does not 
exceed 5 percent of family income as 
applied during the monthly or quarterly 
period specified by the State. We further 
propose that the State plan describe the 
State’s methods for tracking cost sharing 
charges, informing recipients and 
providers of their liability, and notifying 
recipients and providers when 
individual recipients have reached their 
aggregate limit on premiums and cost 
sharing. States can use the same 
methods that SCHIP programs use to 
track cost sharing. For example, States 
can program their automated systems to 
track and compute recipients’ cost 
sharing. 
Finally, we propose that the State 
plan specify whether the State permits 
a provider participating under the State 
plan to require payment of authorized 
cost sharing as a condition for the 
provision of covered care, items, or 
services. 
6. General Cost Sharing Protections 
(§ 447.70) 
Under section 1916A(b)(3)(B) of the 
Act, the State plan may not impose 
alternative cost sharing under 1916A(a) 
for the following: 
• Services furnished to individuals 
under 18 years of age who are required 
to be provided Medicaid under section 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, and 
including services furnished to 
individuals with respect to whom child 
welfare services are made available 
under Part B of title IV on the basis of 
being a child in foster care and 
individuals with respect to whom 
adoption or foster care assistance is 
made available under part E of that title, 
without regard to age; 
• Preventive services (such as well 
baby and well child care and 
immunizations) provided to children 
under 18 years of age regardless of 
family income; 
• Services furnished to pregnant 
women, if those services relate to 
pregnancy or to any other medical 
condition that may complicate the 
pregnancy; 
• Services furnished to a terminally 
ill individual who is receiving hospice

care (as defined in section 1905(o) of the 
Act); 
• Services furnished to any 
individual who is an inpatient in a 
hospital, nursing facility, intermediate 
care facility for the mentally retarded, or 
other medical institution, if the 
individual is required, as a condition of 
receiving services in that institution 
under the State plan, to spend for costs 
of medical care all but a minimal 
amount of the individual’s income 
required for personal needs; 
• Emergency services as defined by 
the Secretary for the purposes of section 
1916(a)(2)(D) of the Act; 
• Family planning services and 
supplies described in section 
1905(a)(4)(C) of the Act; 
• Services furnished to women who 
are receiving medical assistance by 
virtue of the application of sections 
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII) and 1902(aa) of 
the Act (breast or cervical cancer 
provisions); and 
• Services furnished to disabled 
children who are receiving medical 
assistance by virtue of the application of 
sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) and 
1902(cc) of the Act. 
In addition, section 1916A(c)(1)(B) of 
the Act prohibits the State plan from 
imposing otherwise applicable cost 
sharing for preferred drugs for 
individuals ‘‘for whom cost sharing may 
not otherwise be imposed under 
subsection (a) due to the application of 
1916A(b)(3)(B) of the Act.’’ Therefore, in 
accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.70(a)(1)(x), we propose that the 
State plan exclude these classes of 
individuals from the imposition of cost 
sharing for preferred drugs within a 
class. 
Section 1916A(b)(3)(C) of the Act 
clarifies that a State may exempt 
additional individuals or services from 
cost sharing. At proposed § 447.70(c), 
we would implement this section. 
Finally, section 1916A(c)(3) of the Act 
requires a State to charge cost sharing 
applicable to a preferred drug in the 
case of a non-preferred drug if the 
prescribing physician determines that 
the preferred drug would not be as 
effective for the individual or would 
have adverse effects for the individual 
or both. We would implement this 
section at proposed § 447.70(b). We 
further propose at § 447.70(b) that such 
overrides meet State criteria for prior 
authorization and be approved through 
the State prior authorization process. 
7. Premium and Cost Sharing 
Exemptions and Protections for 
Individuals With Family Income at or 
Below 100 Percent of the FPL (§ 447.71) 
Under section 1916A(a)(2)(A) of the 
Act, the State plan may not impose 
premiums on individuals whose family 
income is at or below 100 percent of the 
FPL. In accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.71(a) we propose that the State 
plan exclude these individuals from the 
imposition of premiums. 
Under section 1916A(a)(2)(A) of the 
Act, the State plan may not impose cost 
sharing on individuals whose family 
income is at or below 100 percent of the 
FPL with the exception of cost sharing 
for non-preferred drugs and for non- 
emergency services furnished in a 
hospital emergency department. 
However, section 1916A(c)(2)(A)(i) of 
the Act prohibits a State from imposing, 
with respect to a non-preferred drug, 
cost sharing that exceeds the nominal 
amount as otherwise determined under 
section 1916 of the Act and described at 
§ 447.54(a)(3) or (4) for those 
individuals. In addition, section 
1916A(e)(2)(B) of the Act prohibits a 
State from imposing, with respect to 
non-emergency services furnished in a 
hospital emergency department, cost 
sharing that exceeds the nominal 
amount as otherwise determined under 
section 1916 of the Act and described at 
§ 447.54(a)(3) or (4). Furthermore, a 
State may only impose nominal cost 
sharing with respect to non-emergency 
services so long as no cost sharing is 
imposed to receive such care through an 
outpatient department or other 
alternative health care provider in the 
geographic area of the hospital 
emergency department involved. 
In accordance with the statute, we 
propose at § 447.71(b)(1) that cost 
sharing for non-preferred drugs for those 
individuals not exceed the nominal cost 
sharing amount. In addition, we propose 
at § 447.71(b)(2) that cost sharing for 
non-emergency services furnished in a 
hospital emergency department for 
those individuals not exceed the 
nominal cost sharing amount and be 
imposed only so long as no cost sharing 
is imposed on those individuals to 
receive such care through an outpatient 
department or other alternative non- 
emergency services provider in the 
geographic area of the hospital 
emergency department involved. 
Section 1916A(a)(2)(B) of the Act 
provides that the total aggregate amount 
of cost sharing imposed under sections 
1916A(c), 1916A(e), and/or 1916 of the 
Act upon individuals whose family 
income is at or below 100 percent of the 
FPL may not exceed 5 percent of the 
family income of the family involved, as 
applied on a quarterly or monthly basis 
as specified by the State. In accordance 
with the statute, we propose at 
§ 447.71(c) that aggregate cost sharing 
for individuals whose family income is 
at or below 100 percent of the FPL 
applicable to a family of the size 
involved not exceed the maximum 
permitted under § 447.78(b). At 
§ 447.78(b), we propose that the total 
aggregate amount of cost sharing may 
not exceed 5 percent of such family’s 
income for the monthly or quarterly 
period, as specified in the State plan. 
8. Premium and Cost Sharing 
Exemptions and Protections for 
Individuals Whose Family Income is 
Above 100 Percent but Does Not Exceed 
150 Percent of the FPL (§ 447.72) 
Under section 1916A(b)(1)(A) of the 
Act, the State plan may not impose 
premiums on individuals whose family 
incomes exceeds 100 percent, but does 
not exceed 150 percent of the FPL 
applicable to a family of the size 
involved. In accordance with the 
statute, at § 447.72(a), we propose that 
the State plan exclude these individuals 
from the imposition of premiums. 
Section 1916A(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act 
provides that, in the case of individuals 
whose family income exceeds 100 
percent, but does not exceed 150 
percent of the FPL applicable to a family 
of the size involved, cost sharing 
imposed under the State plan may not 
exceed 10 percent of the cost of such 
item or service. However, section 
1916A(c)(2)(A)(i) of the Act prohibits a 
State from imposing, with respect to a 
non-preferred drug, cost sharing that 
exceeds the nominal amount as 
otherwise determined under section 
1916 of the Act and described at 
§ 447.54(a)(3) for those individuals. In 
addition, section 1916A(e)(2)(A) of the 
Act prohibits a State from imposing, 
with respect to non-emergency services 
furnished in a hospital emergency 
department, cost sharing that exceeds 
twice the nominal amount as otherwise 
determined under section 1916 of the 
Act and described at § 447.54(a)(3) for 
those individuals. 
Therefore, in accordance with the 
statute, we propose at § 447.72(b) that 
cost sharing for those individuals under 
the State plan not exceed 10 percent of 
the payment the agency makes for that 
item or service, with the exception that 
it not exceed the nominal cost sharing 
amount for non-preferred drugs or twice 
the nominal cost sharing amount for 
non-emergency services furnished in a 
hospital emergency department. In the 
case of States that do not have fee-for- 
service payment rates, we propose that

any copayment that the State imposes 
for services provided by an MCO may 
not exceed $5.20 for FY 2007. This 
proposal would provide greater 
flexibility to State Medicaid programs 
consistent with that provided to State 
SCHIP programs. Thereafter, any 
copayment that the State imposes for 
services provided by an MCO may not 
exceed this amount as updated each 
October 1 by the percentage increase in 
the medical care component of the CPI– 
U for the period of September to 
September ending in the preceding 
calendar year and then rounded to the 
next highest 10-cent increment. 
Section 1916A(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act 
provides that the total aggregate amount 
of cost sharing imposed under section 
1916 and 1916A of the Act may not 
exceed 5 percent of the family income 
of the family involved, as applied on a 
quarterly or monthly basis as specified 
by the State. In accordance with the 
statute, we propose at § 447.72(c) that 
aggregate cost sharing for individuals 
whose family income exceeds 100 
percent, but does not exceed 150 
percent of the FPL applicable to a family 
of the size involved, not exceed the 
maximum permitted under § 447.78(a). 
At § 447.78(a), we propose that the total 
aggregate amount of cost sharing may 
not exceed 5 percent of such family’s 
income for the monthly or quarterly 
period, as specified in the State plan. 
9. Premium and Cost Sharing 
Protections for Individuals With Family 
Income Above 150 Percent of the FPL 
(§ 447.74) 
Under section 1916A(b)(2) of the Act, 
the State plan may impose premiums 
upon individuals whose family income 
exceeds 150 percent of the FPL 
applicable to a family of the size 
involved provided that, as described at 
section 1916A(b)(2)(A)of the Act, the 
total aggregate amount of premiums and 
cost sharing imposed under section 
1916 and 1916A of the Act not exceed 
5 percent of the family income. In 
accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.74(a), we state that the State plan 
can impose premiums upon individuals 
with family income above 150 percent 
of the FPL subject to the aggregate limit 
on premiums and cost sharing. 
Section 1916A(b)(2)(B) of the Act 
provides that, in the case of individuals 
whose family income exceeds 150 
percent of the FPL applicable to a family 
of the size involved, cost sharing 
imposed under the State plan may not 
exceed 20 percent of the cost of that 
item (including a non-preferred drug) or 
service. Therefore, in accordance with 
the statute, we propose at § 447.74(b) 
that cost sharing for those individuals 
under the State plan not exceed 20 
percent of the payment the agency 
makes for that item or service. In the 
case of States that do not have fee-for- 
service payment rates, we propose that 
any copayment that the State imposes 
for services provided by an MCO may 
not exceed $5.20 for FY 2007. This 
proposal would provide greater 
flexibility to State Medicaid programs 
consistent with that provided to State 
SCHIP programs. Thereafter, any 
copayment that the State imposes for 
services provided by an MCO may not 
exceed this amount as updated each 
October 1 by the percentage increase in 
the medical care component of the CPI– 
U for the period of September to 
September ending in the preceding 
calendar year and then rounded to the 
next highest 10-cent increment. 
Section 1916A(b)(2)(A) of the Act 
provides that the total aggregate amount 
of cost sharing imposed under section 
1916 and 1916A of the Act may not 
exceed 5 percent of the family income 
of the family involved, as applied on a 
quarterly or monthly basis as specified 
by the State. In accordance with the 
statute, we propose at § 447.74(c) that 
aggregate cost sharing for individuals 
whose family income exceeds 150 
percent of the FPL applicable to a family 
of the size involved, not exceed the 
maximum permitted under § 447.78(a). 
At § 447.78(a), we propose that the total 
aggregate amount of premiums and cost 
sharing may not exceed 5 percent of 
such family’s income for the monthly or 
quarterly period, as specified in the 
State plan. 
10. Public Schedule (§ 447.76) 
As described in this preamble, section 
1916 and 1916A of the Act provides 
authority for States to impose premiums 
and cost sharing for items and services, 
including prescription drugs and non- 
emergency use of a hospital emergency 
department, and to require a group or 
groups of individuals to make payment 
as a condition of eligibility or of 
receiving that item or service. In 
§ 447.76(a), we propose that State plans 
provide for schedules of premiums and 
cost sharing. In § 447.76(a), we propose 
that the public schedule contain the 
following information: (1) Current 
premiums, enrollment fees, or similar 
fees; (2) current cost sharing charges; (3) 
the aggregate limits on premiums and 
cost sharing or only cost sharing; (4) 
mechanisms for making payments for 
required premiums and charges; (5) the 
consequences for an applicant or 
recipient who does not pay a premium 
or charge; and (6) a list of hospitals 
charging alternative cost sharing for 
non-emergency use of the emergency 
department. In addition, at § 447.76(b) 
we propose that the State make the 
public schedule available to recipients, 
at the time of enrollment and 
reenrollment and when charges are 
revised, applicants, all participating 
providers, and the general public. 
11. Aggregate Limits on Premiums and 
Cost Sharing (§ 447.78) 
As described above, section 
1916A(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides 
that the total aggregate amount of cost 
sharing imposed under section 1916 and 
1916A of the Act upon individuals with 
family income above 100 percent but at 
or below 150 percent of the FPL may not 
exceed 5 percent of the family income, 
as applied on a quarterly or monthly 
basis as specified by the State. Section 
1916A(c)(2)(C) of the Act reiterates that 
this aggregate limit includes cost 
sharing for prescription drugs and 
section 1916A(e)(2)(C) of the Act 
reiterates that this aggregate limit 
includes cost sharing for non-emergency 
use of a hospital emergency department. 
Section 1916A(b)(2)(A) of the Act 
provides that the total aggregate amount 
of premiums and cost sharing imposed 
under section 1916 and 1916A of the 
Act upon individuals with family 
income above 150 percent of the FPL 
may not exceed 5 percent of the family 
income, as applied on a quarterly or 
monthly basis as specified by the State. 
Again, section 1916A(c)(2)(C) of the Act 
reiterates that this aggregate limit 
includes cost sharing for prescription 
drugs, and section 1916A(e)(2)(C) of the 
Act reiterates that this aggregate limit 
includes cost sharing for non-emergency 
use of a hospital emergency department. 
Finally, section 1916A(a)(2)(B) of the 
Act provides that to the extent that cost 
sharing under section 1916A(c) of the 
Act for prescription drugs, cost sharing 
under section 1916A(e) of the Act for 
non-emergency use of a hospital 
emergency department, and/or cost 
sharing under section 1916 of the Act is 
imposed upon individuals whose family 
income is at or below 100 percent of the 
FPL, the total aggregate amount of 
premiums and cost sharing imposed 
may not exceed 5 percent of the family 
income. 
In accordance with these provisions, 
at § 447.78(a), we propose that for 
individuals with family income above 
100 percent of the FPL the aggregate 
amount of premiums (when applicable) 
and cost sharing under section 1916 and 
1916A of the Act not exceed 5 percent 
of a family’s income for the monthly or 
quarterly period, as specified by the 
State in the State plan. At § 447.78(b), 
we propose that for individuals whose 
family income is at or below 100

percent of the FPL the aggregate amount 
of cost sharing under sections 1916, 
1916A(c), and/or 1916A(e) of the Act 
not exceed 5 percent of a family’s 
income for the monthly or quarterly 
period, as specified by the State in the 
State plan. We also propose at 
§ 447.78(c) that family income shall be 
determined in a manner and for that 
period as specified by the State in the 
State plan. We clarify that States may 
use gross income to compute family 
income and that they may use a 
different methodology for computing 
family income for purposes of 
determining the aggregate limits than for 
determining income eligibility. 
12. Enforceability of Premiums and Cost 
Sharing (§ 447.80) 
Section 1916A(d)(1) of the Act 
permits a State to condition Medicaid 
eligibility upon the prepayment of 
premiums imposed under section 
1916A of the Act or to terminate 
Medicaid eligibility for the failure to 
pay such a premium for 60 days or 
more. The statute provides States 
flexibility to implement these 
requirements for some or all groups of 
individuals as specified in the State 
plan. The statute also provides 
flexibility to waive payment of any 
premium in any case where the State 
determines that requiring that payment 
would create undue hardship. 
In accordance with the statute, we 
propose at § 447.80(a) to permit a State 
to condition eligibility for a group or 
group of individuals upon prepayment 
of premiums, to terminate the eligibility 
of an individual from a group or groups 
of individuals for failure to pay for 60 
days or more, and to waive payment in 
any case where requiring the payment 
would create undue hardship. 
Section 1916A(d)(2) of the Act 
permits a State to allow a provider to 
require that an individual, as a 
condition of receiving an item or 
service, pay the cost sharing charge 
imposed under section 1916A of the 
Act. The provider is not prohibited by 
this authority from choosing to reduce 
or waive cost sharing on a case-by-case 
basis. However, section 1916A(a)(2)(A) 
specifies that section 1916A(d)(2) shall 
not apply in the case of an individual 
whose family income does not exceed 
100 percent of the FPL applicable to a 
family of the size involved. 
In accordance with the statute, at 
§ 447.80(b) we propose that a State 
permit a provider, including a 
pharmacy, to require an individual to 
pay cost sharing imposed under section 
1916A of the Act as a condition of 
receiving an item or service. However, 
at § 447.80(b)(1) we specify that a 
provider, including a pharmacy or 
hospital, may not require an individual 
whose family income is at or below 100 
percent of the FPL to pay the cost 
sharing charge as a condition of 
receiving the item or service. In 
addition, at § 447.80(b)(2) we propose 
that a hospital that has determined after 
an appropriate medical screening under 
section 1867 of the Act that an 
individual does not have an emergency 
medical condition must first provide the 
name and location of an available and 
accessible alternate non-emergency 
services provider, the fact that the 
alternate provider can provide the 
services without the imposition of that 
cost sharing, and a referral to coordinate 
scheduling of treatment before it can 
require payment of the cost sharing. 
Finally, at § 447.80(b)(3) we propose 
that a provider may reduce or waive 
cost sharing imposed under section 
1916A of the Act on a case-by-case 
basis. 
13. Restrictions on Payments to 
Providers (§ 447.82) 
Proposed § 447.82 requires States to 
reduce the amount of State payments to 
providers by the amount of recipients’ 
cost sharing obligations under section 
1916A of the Act. However, States have 
the ability to increase total State plan 
rates to providers to maintain the same 
level of State payment when cost 
sharing is introduced. 
C. SCHIP Regulations 
1. Maximum Allowable Cost Sharing 
Charges on Targeted Low-Income 
Children in Families With Incomes 
From 101 to 150 Percent of the FPL 
(§ 457.555) 
We are revising § 457.555 to update 
the existing ‘‘nominal’’ SCHIP cost 
sharing amounts, specifically the 
copayment amounts described at 
§ 457.555(a)(1) and (2), (c), and (d) and 
the deductible amount described at 
§ 447.555(a)(4). Section 6041(b)(2) of the 
DRA requires the Secretary to increase 
the nominal Medicaid cost sharing 
amounts under section 1916 of the Act 
for each year (beginning with 2006) by 
the annual percentage increase in the 
medical care component of the 
consumer price index for all urban 
consumers (U.S. city average) as 
rounded up in an appropriate manner. 
While section 6041(b)(2) of the DRA 
does not require the Secretary to 
increase the SCHIP nominal cost sharing 
amounts, we believe that our proposal is 
consistent with sections 
2103(e)(3)(A)(ii) and 2103(e)(1)(B) of the 
SCHIP statute. Section 2103(e)(3)(A)(ii) 
of the Act specifies that a State SCHIP 
plan may not impose a deductible, cost 
sharing, or similar charge that exceeds 
an amount that is nominal as 
determined consistent with Medicaid 
regulations at § 447.54, with an 
appropriate adjustment for inflation or 
other reasons as the Secretary 
determines to be reasonable. Section 
2103(e)(1)(B) of the Act prohibits a State 
SCHIP plan from imposing cost sharing 
that favors children from families with 
higher income over children from 
families with lower income. By 
updating the existing SCHIP nominal 
cost sharing amounts by the annual 
percentage increase in the medical care 
component of the CPI–U by the period 
of September to September ending in 
the preceding calendar year, we would 
retain nominal cost sharing amounts 
that reflect a SCHIP recipient’s ability to 
pay higher cost sharing. The medical 
care component of the CPI–U increased 
by 3.9 percent between September 2004 
and September 2005, so we propose to 
update the nominal amounts by that 
factor and then round to the next higher 
10-cent increment. We propose to round 
to the next higher 10-cent increment 
because it will simplify calculation and 
collection of the amounts involved. 
Based on this methodology, we propose 
the following copayment maximum 
amounts: 
Total cost of services Maximum amount 
$15.00 or less ............... $1.10 
$15.01 to $40 ............... 2.10 
$40.01 to $80 ............... 3.20 
$80.01 or more ............. 5.20 
We also propose that the copayments 
for services provided by an MCO and for 
emergency services provided by an 
institution not exceed $5.20 per visit 
and that the copayment for non- 
emergency services furnished in a 
hospital emergency room to targeted 
low-income children with family 
income from 101 to 150 percent of the 
FPL not exceed $10.40. Finally, we 
propose that a deductible not exceed 
$3.20 per family per month. 
States should use these updated 
nominal amounts during FY 2007. 
Thereafter, we will update these 
amounts each October 1 by the 
percentage increase in the medical care 
component of the CPI–U for the period 
of September to September ending in 
the preceding calendar year and then 
rounding to the next higher 10-cent 
increment.

day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection 
should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we 
solicit comment on the following issues: 
• The need for the information 
collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
• The accuracy of our estimate of the 
information collection burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of these issues for the following 
sections of this document that contain 
information collection requirements: 
Section 447.64 Premiums, Enrollment 
Fees, or Similar Fees: State Plan 
Requirements 
Section 447.64 requires a State 
imposing premiums, enrollment fees, or 
similar fees on individuals to describe 
in the State plan: 
(a) The group or groups of individuals 
that may be subject to the premiums, 
enrollment fees, or similar charges. 
(b) The schedule of the premiums, 
enrollment fees, or similar fees imposed. 
(c) The methodology used to 
determine family income for purposes 
of the limitations related to family 
income level that are described below, 
including the period and periodicity of 
those determinations. 
(d) The methodology used to ensure 
compliance with the requirements of 
§ 447.78 that the aggregate amount of 
premiums and cost sharing imposed for 
all individuals in the family does not 
exceed 5 percent of the family income 
of the family involved. 
(e) The process for informing the 
recipients, applicants, providers, and 
the public of the schedule of premiums, 
enrollment fees, or similar fees for a 
group or groups of individuals in 
accordance with § 447.76. 
(f) The notice of, timeframe for, and 
manner of required premium payments 
for a group or groups of individuals and 
the consequences for an individual who 
does not pay. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort it 
would take for a State to include this 
detailed description in the State plan. 
We estimate it would take one State 
approximately 20 minutes to 
incorporate this information in their 
plan. We believe 56 States will be 
affected by this requirement for a total 
annual burden of 18.67 hours. 
Section 447.68 Copayments, 
Coinsurance, Deductibles, or Similar 
Cost Sharing Charges: State Plan 
Requirements 
Section 447.68 requires a State 
imposing copayments, coinsurance, 
deductibles, or similar cost sharing 
charges on individuals to describe in the 
State plan: 
(a) The group or groups of individuals 
that may be subject to the cost sharing 
charge. 
(b) The methodology used to 
determine family income, for purposes 
of the limitations on cost sharing related 
to family income that are described 
below, including the period and 
periodicity of those determinations. 
(c) The item or service for which the 
charge is imposed. 
(d) The methods, such as the use of 
integrated automated systems, for 
tracking cost sharing charges, informing 
recipients and providers of their 
liability, and notifying recipients and 
providers when individual recipients 
have paid the maximum cost sharing 
charges permitted for the period of time. 
(e) The process for informing 
recipients, applicants, providers, and 
the public of the schedule of cost 
sharing charges for specific items and 
services for a group or groups of 
individuals in accordance with § 447.76. 
(f) The methodology used to ensure 
that: 
(1) The aggregate amount of premiums 
and cost sharing imposed for all 
individuals with family income above 
100 percent of the FPL does not exceed 
5 percent of the family income of the 
family involved. 
(2) The aggregate amount of cost 
sharing under sections 1916, 1916A(c), 
and/or 1916A(e) of the Act for 
individuals with family income at or 
below 100 percent of the FPL does not 
exceed 5 percent of the family income 
of the family involved. 
(g) The notice of, timeframe for, and 
manner of required cost sharing and the 
consequences for failure to pay. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort it 
would take for a State to include this 
detailed description in the State plan. 
We estimate it would take one State 
approximately 20 minutes to 
incorporate this information in their 
plan. We believe 56 States will be 
affected by this requirement for a total 
annual burden of 18.67 hours. 
Section 447.76 Public Schedule 
Section 447.76(a) requires States to 
make available to the groups in 
paragraph (b) of this section a public 
schedule that contains the following 
information: 
(1) Current premiums, enrollment 
fees, or similar fees. 
(2) Current cost sharing charges. 
(3) The aggregate limit on premiums 
and cost sharing. 
(4) Mechanisms for making payments 
for required premiums and charges. 
(5) The consequences for an applicant 
or recipient who does not pay a 
premium or charge. 
(6) A list of hospitals charging 
alternative cost sharing for non- 
emergency use of the emergency 
department. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort it 
would take the State to prepare and 
make available to appropriate parties a 
public schedule. We estimate that it 
would take 20 minutes per State. We 
believe 56 States will be affected by this 
requirement for an annual burden of 
18.67 hours. 
Section 447.80 Enforceability of 
Premiums and Cost Sharing 
Section 447.80(b)(1) states that a 
hospital that has determined after an 
appropriate medical screening pursuant 
to section 489.24, that an individual 
does not have an emergency medical 
condition before imposing cost sharing 
on an individual must provide the name 
and location of an available and 
accessible alternate non-emergency 
services provider as defined in section 
1916A(e)(4)(B) of the Act, the fact that 
the alternate provider can provide the 
services with the imposition of a lesser 
cost sharing amount or no cost sharing, 
and a referral to coordinate scheduling 
of treatment by this provider before 
requiring payment of cost sharing. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort it 
would take for a hospital to provide the 
name and location of an alternate 
provider who can provide services of a 
lesser cost sharing amount or no cost 
sharing and a referral. We estimate the 
burden on a hospital to be 30 minutes. 
We believe the number of hospital visits 
will be 4 million; therefore, the total 
annual burden is 2 million hours. 
We have submitted a copy of this 
proposed rule to OMB for its review of 
the information collection requirements 
described above. These requirements are 
not effective until they have been 
approved by OMB.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 (September 1993, Regulatory 
Planning and Review), the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 
1980, Pub. L. 96–354), section 1102(b) of 
the Social Security Act, the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), and Executive Order 13132. 
Executive Order 12866 (as amended 
by Executive Order 13258, which 
merely reassigns responsibility of 
duties) directs agencies to assess all 
costs and benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). A regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) must be prepared for major rules 
with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any 1 year). 
This rule reaches the economic 
threshold and thus is considered a 
major rule. 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses. For purposes of the RFA, 
small entities include small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions. Most 
hospitals and most other providers and 
suppliers are small entities, either by 
nonprofit status or by having revenues 
of $6.5 million to $31.5 million in any 
1 year. Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. We have determined, and the 
Secretary certifies, that this rule would 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of 
a Core-Based Statistical Area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. We have 
determined, and the Secretary certifies, 
that this rule would not have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4) also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule that may result in 
expenditures in any 1 year by State, 
local, or tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100 million, updated annually for 
inflation. That threshold level is 
currently approximately $127 million. 
We have determined that this rule 
would require new spending in excess 
of the threshold. Table 2 outlines the 
total increase to Medicaid enrollees cost 
sharing as a result of all the provisions 
of the DRA. This includes an estimated 
cost increase to Medicaid recipients of 
$105 million in 2007, $155 million in 
2008, $255 million in 2009, $375 
million in 2010, and $455 million in 
2011. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
We have determined that this rule 
would not impose substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments.

estimate of the anticipated effects of this 
rule.

These estimates are based on data 
regarding copayments in the Medicaid 
program derived from a 2004 Kaiser 
Family Foundation survey, and data on 
premiums from a 2004 report by the 
U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
In addition, we have used enrollment 
data from the Medicaid Statistical 
Information System and utilization data 
from the 2002 Medicaid Expenditure 
Panel Survey conducted by the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality. 
We assume that only States that 
currently charge copayments and/or 
premiums for some groups will take 
advantage of the option to expand the 
use of premiums and copayments under 
the DRA provisions. States now 
charging copayments are assumed to 
increase them on average to 75 percent 
of maximum possible levels by 2011, 
and states currently charging premiums 
are assumed to add premiums 
requirements for some groups not 
currently allowed, also reaching 75 
percent of the maximum possible by 
2011. 
In addition to direct savings from 
increased cost sharing, we assume there 
would be declines in utilization as some 
enrollees subject to new cost sharing 
requirements choose to decrease their 
use of services. The decline is assumed 
to create additional savings of 75 
percent of direct savings for physician 
and outpatient hospital services, 100 
percent for drugs, and 125 percent for 
dental services. These additional 
savings are assumed to be reduced 
somewhat as a result of some providers 
failing to collect copayments. Savings 
are split between Federal and State 
governments using an average matching 
rate of 57 percent. 
Table 2 illustrates that the estimated 
impact for Medicaid enrollees as a result 
of all of the cost-sharing provisions of 
the DRA are $105 million for 2007, $155 
million for 2008, $255 million for 2009, 
$375 million for 2010, and $455 million 
for 2011. Although, these estimates 
reflect an increase of costs to 
beneficiaries, we do not believe this will 
pose a barrier to accessing health care. 
The law provides that States can impose 
alternative cost sharing. We believe 
through the use of alternative cost 
sharing, States will help recipients 
become more educated and efficient 
health care consumers. We do, however, 
solicit comments on these assumptions. 
C. Alternatives Considered 
This rule is necessary to implement 
section 1916A of the Social Security 
Act, which was established by the 
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) 
and amended by the Tax Relief and 
Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA). 
D. Accounting Statement and Table 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf), in the table below, we 
have prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
provisions of this proposed rule. This 
table provides our best estimate of the 
decrease in Medicaid payment as a 
result of the changes presented in this 
proposed rule. All savings are classified 
as transfers to the Federal Government.

E. Conclusion 
We expect that this rule would 
promote the modernization of the 
Medicaid program. The proposed rule 
would provide a new option to States to 
create programs that are aligned with 
today’s Medicaid populations and the 
health care environment. Through 
alternative cost sharing, States would 
help recipients become more educated 
and efficient health care consumers. 
Thus, this rule would help ensure the 
sustainability of the Medicaid program 
over time. 
In accordance with the provisions of 
Executive Order 12866, this regulation 
was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget.

CFR chapter IV as set forth below: 
PART 447—PAYMENTS FOR 
SERVICES 
1. The authority citation for part 447 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: Sec. 1102 of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1302). 
2. Section 447.54 is amended by— 
a. Republishing the introductory text 
to paragraph (a). 
b. Revising paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(3). 
c. Adding new paragraph (a)(4). 
The republication, revisions, and 
additions read as follows: 
§ 447.54 Maximum allowable and nominal 
charges. 
(a) Non-institutional services. Except 
as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, for non-institutional services, 
the plan must provide that the following 
requirements are met: 
(1) For Federal Fiscal Year 2007, any 
deductible it imposes does not exceed 
$2.10 per month per family for each 
period of Medicaid eligibility. For 
example, if Medicaid eligibility is 
certified for a 3-month period, the 
maximum deductible which may be 
imposed on a family for the period of 
eligibility is $6.30. Thereafter, any 
deductible should not exceed these 
amounts as updated each October 1 by 
the percentage increase in the medical 
care component of the CPI-U for the 
period of September to September 
ending in the preceding calendar year, 
and then rounded to the next higher 10- 
cent increment. 
* * * * * 
(3)(i) For Federal Fiscal Year 2007, 
any copayments it imposes under a fee- 
for-service delivery system do not 
exceed the amounts shown in the 
following table: 
State payment Maximum copayment 
$10 or less ................................ $.60 
$10.01 to $25 ........................... 1.10 
$25.01 to $50 ........................... 2.10 
$50.01 or more ......................... 3.20 
(ii) Thereafter, any copayments 
should not exceed these amounts as 
updated each October 1 by the 
percentage increase in the medical care 
component of the CPI-U for the period 
of September to September ending in 
the preceding calendar year and then 
rounded to the next higher 10-cent 
increment. 
(4) For Federal Fiscal Year 2007, any 
copayment it imposes for services 
provided by an MCO may not exceed 
$5.20 per visit. Thereafter, any 
copayment should not exceed these 
amounts as updated each October 1 by 
the percentage increase in the medical 
care component of the CPI-U for the 
period of September to September 
ending in the preceding calendar year 
and then rounded to the next higher 10- 
cent increment. 
* * * * * 
3. Section 447.55 is amended by 
revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§ 447.55 Standard copayment. 
* * * * * 
(b) This standard copayment amount 
for any service may be determined by 
applying the maximum copayment 
amounts specified in § 447.54(a) and (b) 
to the agency’s average or typical 
payment for that service. For example, 
if the agency’s typical payment for 
prescribed drugs is $4 to $5 per 
prescription, the agency might set a 
standard copayment of $.60 per 
prescription. This standard copayment 
may be adjusted based on updated 
copayments as permitted under 
§ 447.54(a)(3). 
4. New §§ 447.62, 447.64, 447.66, 
447.68, 447.70, 447.71, 447.72, 447.74, 
447.76, 447.78, 447.80, and § 447.82, 
and a new undesignated center heading 
are added to read as follows: 
ALTERNATIVE PREMIUMS AND 
COST SHARING UNDER SECTION 
1916A 
§ 447.62 Alternative premiums and cost 
sharing: Basis, purpose and scope. 
(a) Section 1916A of the Act sets forth 
options for alternative premiums and 
cost sharing, which are premiums and 
cost sharing that are not subject to the 
limitations under section 1916 of the 
Act as described in § 447.51 through 
§ 447.56. For States that impose 
alternative premiums, § 447.64 through 
§ 447.66, § 447.72, § 447.74, § 447.78, 
and § 447.80 prescribe State plan 
requirements and options for alternative 
premiums and the standards and 
conditions under which States may 
impose them. For States that impose 
alternative cost sharing, § 447.68 
through § 447.72, § 447.74, § 447.78, and 
§ 447.80 prescribe State plan 
requirements and options for alternative 
cost sharing and the standards and 
conditions under which States may 
impose alternative cost sharing. For 
other individuals, premiums and cost 
sharing must comply with the 
requirements described in § 447.50 
through § 447.60. 
(b) Neither section 1916A of the Act 
nor the regulations referenced in 
paragraph (a) of this section affect the 
following: 
(1) The Secretary’s authority to waive 
limitations on premiums and cost 
sharing under this subpart. 
(2) Existing waivers with regard to the 
imposition of premiums and cost 
sharing. 
§ 447.64 Alternative premiums, enrollment 
fees, or similar fees: State plan 
requirements. 
When a State imposes alternative 
premiums, enrollment fees, or similar

Proposed Flood Elevation 
Determinations 
AGENCY: Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, DHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: Comments are requested on 
the proposed Base (1 percent annual- 
chance) Flood Elevations (BFEs) and 
proposed BFE modifications for the 
communities listed in the table below. 
The purpose of this notice is to seek 
general information and comment 
regarding the proposed regulatory flood 
elevations for the reach described by the 
downstream and upstream locations in 
the table below. The BFEs and modified 
BFEs are a part of the floodplain 
management measures that the 
community is required either to adopt 
or show evidence of having in effect in 
order to qualify or remain qualified for 
participation in the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP). In addition, 
these elevations, once finalized, will be 
used by insurance agents, and others to 
calculate appropriate flood insurance 
premium rates for new buildings and 
the contents in those buildings. 
DATES: Comments are to be submitted 
on or before May 22, 2008. 
ADDRESSES: The corresponding 
preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map 
(FIRM) for the proposed BFEs for each 
community are available for inspection 
at the community’s map repository. The 
respective addresses are listed in the 
table below.
