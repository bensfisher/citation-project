EXECUTIVE SUMMARY      
This Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) analyzes the potential impacts of new 
performance requirements and test procedures for ejection mitigation systems in rollover and 
certain side crashes.  The intent of the rulemaking is to protect both belted and unbelted 
occupants from partial or complete ejection through side windows in vehicle crashes.   
  
Test Requirements 
The proposed rule requires that the occupant containment countermeasure be tested by impact 
from a guided 18 kg featureless head form traveling laterally and horizontally.  The performance 
criterion is a displacement limit, measured by the impactor, of 100 mm beyond the inside surface 
of the window at the target location being tested.  It requires that each side window, for up to 
three vehicle rows, be impacted at any of four locations referenced to the edges of the window 
opening at two impact velocities (16 and 24 km/h).  The 16 km/h impact will occur 6 seconds 
after air bag deployment and the 24 km/h impact will occur 1.5 seconds after air bag deployment.     
 
Countermeasures 
The agency believes that curtain air bags will be used to pass the test.  We believe that most 
manufacturers will have to make changes to the air bags that have been or will be installed in 
vehicles in response to the recent pole test upgrade of FMVSS No. 214.1  Side curtain air bags 
will be made wider or combination (combo) air bags will be replaced with a curtain to pass the 
impactor test.  Vehicle manufacturers would install a single-window curtain for each side and 
these window curtains are assumed to provide protection for both front and rear seat occupants.

Although the majority of vehicles tested met the linear impactor head form (headform) test 
requirement at the upper portion of the window opening, none of the vehicles met the 
requirement at all impact points.  For current OEM ejection countermeasures, a particularly 
difficult point to meet the test is the front lower corner of the front window near the A-pillar (test 
point A1).     
 
We examined two different types of countermeasures that are designed to meet the proposed 
headform impact requirements.  One approach is to cover the opening with a wider curtain air 
bag (called “full curtain” in the PRIA).  However, we believe that even if the window is 
completely covered with a header-mounted curtain air bag and limited the headform 
displacement to some value less than 100 mm, some partial ejections could occur through a 
potential gap along the bottom of the air bag between the air bag and vehicle’s window sill.  As 
an alternative to this design approach, manufacturers may install laminated glazing in the 
window opening (called “partial curtain plus laminated glazing”) to prevent ejections through 
test point A1 and the lower gap.  There is still a question whether a window curtain and 
laminated glazing could pass Point A1 at 24 km/h (15 mph).  In this PRIA, we explore the 
implications of the agency lowering the test speed at Point A1 to 20 km/h (12 mph) in the 1.5-
second test and how manufacturers would design an ejection mitigation system under such a 
condition (a third countermeasure called “A1 full curtain”).2    
                                                          
2 As discussed, the goal is to cover the whole window opening.  As part of the rulemaking effort, the agency tested a 
prototype curtain ejection mitigation system developed by TRW in a dynamic rollover fixture (DRF).  The test 
results showed that in a near worst case ejection condition an unrestrained small child could be ejected through a 
small window opening (target position A1) when the area is not fully covered, even when initially aimed at another 
part of the window (target position A2).  For additional discussion, see a report titled “NHTSA’s Crashworthiness 
Rollover Research Program,” Summers, S., et al., 19th International Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety 
of Vehicles,” paper number 05-0279, 2005.  These benefits estimates are based on lateral rollovers.  We do not

Benefits 
The agency estimates benefits for both partially and completely ejected occupants in rollovers 
and certain side crashes.  The agency’s annualized injury data from 1997 to 2005 National 
Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and fatality counts 
adjusted to 2005 Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) levels show that there are 6,174 
fatalities and 5,271 Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 3+ non-fatal injuries for 
occupants ejected through side windows.  The potential benefits estimated in the 214-FRIA for 
the upgrade to FMVSS No. 214 were excluded from the ejection mitigation benefits.  After 
adjusting for assumed full compliance with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) penetration in the 
model year (MY) 2011 vehicle fleet and current compliance with the proposed rule, we 
estimated that the proposed rule being met by the full curtain would save 390 to 402 lives and 
prevent 296 to 310 serious injuries, annually.3  For the estimated benefits, we assumed that the 
belt use rate observed in 2005 remains unchanged.  The majority of the benefits are for unbelted 
occupants but the analysis shows that 13 percent of the benefits would be from belted occupants: 
10 percent from rollovers and about 3 percent from side crashes considered. 
 
Costs 
Potential compliance costs for the linear impactor headform test vary considerably and are 
dependent upon the types of the FMVSS No. 214-head/side air bags that will be installed by 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
know the effectiveness of these bags in other rollover events, such as end-to-end or more complex rolls.  We suspect 
that the effectiveness would decrease noticeably in non-lateral rollovers.   
3 The benefit estimate was made based on particular assumptions used in the analysis.  The range of potential 
benefits is due to different assumptions about where in the opening occupants are ejected.  The benefit chapter in the 
PRIA discuses the assumptions used for occupant ejections.  In addition, when inputs that affect the analysis are 
uncertain, the agency makes its best judgment about the range of values that will occur through sensitivity analyses, 
as discussed in Chapter VII.       
      E- 4
vehicle manufacturers to comply with the oblique pole test requirements.  For vehicles with two 
rows of seats to be covered with a curtain air bag, we estimate an ejection mitigation system 
(consisting of 2 window curtains, 2 thorax air bags for the front seat occupants only, 2 side 
impact sensors and 1 rollover sensor) would cost about $299.44, when compared to a vehicle 
with no side air bags.  This is $49.97 more than a vehicle with a side air bag system designed to 
meet the FMVSS No. 214 pole and MDB tests.  The estimated MY 2011 sales show that 25% of 
light vehicles will have a third row seat.  When the first through 3rd row are covered with a 
curtain air bag, we estimated the cost per vehicle will increase by $61.92, when compared to a 
vehicle equipped with a FMVSS No. 214-curtain system. 
 
The manufacturers’ plans for MY 2011 head air bag sales show that about 1%, 44% and 55% of 
vehicles would be equipped with combination air bags, curtain air bags without rollover sensor 
and with rollover sensors, respectively.  Thus, manufacturers are planning to provide 55% of the 
MY 2011 vehicles with an expensive part of the cost of meeting the ejection mitigation test, the 
rollover sensor which is estimated to cost $38.02.  Our analysis shows that most vehicles that are 
equipped with combination air bags would be convertibles (about 1%).  The agency asks for 
comments on the feasibility of installing countermeasures other than header mounted air bag 
curtains such as door-mounted ejection mitigation curtains in convertibles on a widespread basis 
and the associated costs and benefits.  Given that 25% of light trucks have 3 rows of seats, we 
estimate the average cost per vehicle would increase by $54 if there were no voluntary 
compliance by manufacturers for MY 2011.4  Manufacturers’ plans for MY 2011 indicate at 
least $20 per vehicle of costs toward this proposal.  Thus, compared to the manufacturers’ plans 
                                                          
4 We estimated that a total cost of $920 million when all light vehicles are equipped with rollover ejection curtains.  
For the $920M, $583M would be a result of the final rule and the remaining $337M would be resulting from 
voluntarily installed rollover curtain bags.  
      E- 5
this proposal will add about $34 per light vehicle at a total cost of $583 million for the full 
curtain countermeasure.

manufacturers, 98.7% of MY 2011 vehicles will be equipped with curtain air bags and 55% of vehicles with curtain 
air bags will be equipped with a roll sensor.  
 
 
Cost per Equivalent Life Saved and Net Benefits   
Estimates were made of the net costs per equivalent life saved.  For the full curtain 
countermeasure5, the low end of the range is $1.57 million per equivalent life saved, using a 3 
percent discount rate.  The high end of the range is $2.04 million per equivalent life saved, using 
a 7 percent discount rate.   
 
Net benefit analysis differs from cost effectiveness analysis in that it requires that benefits be 
assigned a monetary value, and that this value is compared to the monetary value of costs to 
derive a net benefit.  When we assume that the percentage of MY 2011 air bag sales remain 
unchanged (i.e., 1%, 44% and 55% of vehicles would be equipped with combination air bags, 
curtain air bags without rollover sensor and with rollover sensors, respectively), it resulted in 
$1,605 to $1,680 million net benefits using a 3 percent discount rate, and $1,158 to $1,217 
                                                          
5 The cost equivalent and net benefits analyses showed that the full curtain would have a cost per equivalent of 
$1.57M and $1.98M discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively, when the weighted risk of distribution method is used.  
When the uniform distribution method is used, the full curtain would have a cost equivalent of $1.63M and $2.04M 
discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively.   For the “A1 full cover” curtain, we estimated $1.61M and $2.02M 
discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively, with the weighted distribution method and $1.70M and $2.14M discounted 
at 3% and 7%, respectively, with the uniform distribution method

6 The Department of Transportation has determined that the best current estimate of the economic value of 
preventing a human fatality is $5.8 million (“Treatment of the Economic Value of a Statistical Life in Departmental 
Analyses,” Tyler D. Duval, Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, February 5, 2008. The $6.1 million 
comprehensive cost was based on the $5.8 million statistical life.  
7 The “full curtain” and the “A1 full curtain” cover the window opening area fully.  Since the incremental costs are 
based on the increase in material cost, we assumed that the incremental costs are the same for these two full-cover 
bags.  Accordingly, we believe that the “A1 curtain” bag could be re-designed, without additional materials, to meet 
the proposed 24 km/h requirement at the lower impact point, A1.

The estimated benefits from the ejection mitigation systems considered show that the partial 
curtain plus laminated glazing system would result in most benefits (494 lives saved) followed 
by the full curtain and the partial curtain.  However, the curtain plus glazing system would be the 
most costly system ($1,494 million) followed by the full curtains.  When the comprehensive 
saving (for preventing a statistical life) was considered, the net benefit analysis showed that the 
full curtain would result in the lowest cost per equivalent life saved and the highest net benefits.

I. INTRODUCTION     
General: As a crash type, rollovers are second only to frontal crashes in the annual number of 
fatalities in light vehicles.  Figure I-1 shows the distribution of fatalities by crash type from 1992 
to 2004 in the Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS).  Although frontal crash fatalities have 
remained fairly steady at around 12,000 per year, going back to 1992, rollover fatalities have be 
steadily increasing from 8,600 in 1992 to 10,600 in 2004. In 2004, 33% of fatalities were in 
rollover crashes.

The National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES) can be 
used to determine the frequency of particular crash types as documented by police accident 
reports (PARs).  Dividing the number of fatalities in each crash type by the frequency of the 
      I- 2
crash type gives a measure of the relative risk of fatality for each crash type.  Figure I-2 
graphically represents this relative risk.  This data clearly shows the deadly nature of rollover 
crashes.  An occupant is 14 times more likely to be killed in a rollover than in a frontal crash.

Figure I-2  Fatality Risk per 1000 Occupants Exposed to Each Crash Type (Avg. 1992 – 2004 
FARS) 
As stated above, rollover fatalities have been increasing for many years, with the number in 2004 
about 2,000 more than in 1992.  The main reason for this has been an increase in rollover 
fatalities in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment.  Figure I-3 shows the rollover fatalities by 
vehicle type, over time.  There were approximately 800 SUV rollover fatalities in 1992 as 
compared to approximately 2,900 in 2004.  So, the increase in SUV rollover fatalities accounts 
for the overall increase in rollover fatalities.

Figure I-3 Rollover Fatalities by Vehicle Type- 1992 to 2004 FARS 
Using FARS data shown in Figure I-4 we see that over the last 13 reporting years about half of 
the occupants killed in rollovers are completely ejected from the vehicle.  Note that in this graph 
the FARS data lumps partially ejected and un-ejected occupants together.  This is because 
partially ejection is sometimes difficult to determine and we do not expect the PAR generated 
FARS data to have an accurate representation of partially ejected occupant fatalities.

Figure I-4 Rollover Fatalities by Ejection Status-1992 to 2004 FARS    
The FARS data in Figure I-4 can be used in conjunction with NASS GES data to determine the 
relative risk of being killed in a rollover as a function of whether or not the occupant is fully 
ejected.  Figure I-5 shows this risk averaged over the period of 1992 to 2004.  There are 317 
fully ejected occupants killed for every 1,000 fully ejected occupants in rollover crashes or a 
32% probability of being killed if fully ejected.  By comparison 14 of every 1,000 occupants not 
fully ejected are killed in rollover crashes or a 1.4% probability of being killed.  Thus, an 
occupant is 23 times more likely to be killed if fully ejected.  This clearly shows the benefit of 
preventing complete ejections in rollovers.

Injuries and Fatalities by Rollover Severity: The majority of occupants exposed to rollover 
crashes are in vehicles that roll 2 ¼-turns or less.  However, the distribution of ejected occupants 
who are seriously injured (maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) 3+) and killed is skewed 
towards rollovers with higher degrees of rotation, as shown in Figure I-6.  The graph was 
generated from NASS CDS data of occupant exposed to a rollover crash from 1988 to 2005.  All 
rollover crashes were included irrespective of whether it was coded as the most harmful event.  
Note that half of all fatal complete ejections occurred in crashes with 5+ ¼-turns.

Ejection Routes in All Crashes: In this section, we used annualized injury data from 1997 to 
2005 NASS CDS and fatality counts adjusted to 2005 FARS levels to analyze ejection routes. 
All unknowns have been distributed and all crash types are included.  However, the counts are 
restricted to ejection occupants that were injured.  In addition, in NASS CDS the ejection route 
for side windows is only explicitly coded for the front (Row 1 Window) and rear (Row 2 
Window).  The third and further rearward side window ejections should be coded as “other 
glazing.” This is because there are specific codes available for coding roof glazing, windshield 
and backlight.  However, when extracting NASS cases of known ejections through “other 
glazing,” we observed 17 unweighted occupants.  A hard copy review of these cases showed that 
9 were known 3rd row side window ejections, but five cases were miscoded.  Four were actually 
      I- 7
backlight ejections and one was a sunroof ejection.  The known 3rd row ejections were recoded 
as “Row 3 Window” ejections.  
 
Table I-1 shows the MAIS 1-2, MAIS 3+ and fatality distribution of ejected occupants by eight 
potential ejection routes.  Table I-2 gives the percentage of the total at each injury level.  
Ejection through side windows makes up the greatest part of the ejection problem. There are 
6,174 fatalities, 5,271 MAIS 3+ injuries, and 18,353 MAIS 1-2 injuries for occupants ejected 
through side windows.  These make up 61%, 47% and 68% of all ejected fatalities, MAIS 3+ 
injuries, and MAIS 1-2 injuries, respectively.

and 12,229 MAIS 1-2 injuries for occupants ejected through side windows in rollovers.

Proliferation of Vehicles with Rollover Sensors: The availability of vehicles that offer inflatable 
side curtains that deploy in a rollover has increased since they first became available (Figure I-7). 
For the 2007 model year, rollover sensors are available on approximately 95 models with the 
system being standard equipment on about half.  Rollover sensors are available predominantly on 
SUVs.

Current State and Future Direction of Ejection Countermeasures: The first generation of roof 
mounted inflatable curtain air bags were introduced in the U.S. in the late 1990s (1998 Volvo 
S80, Figure I-8).  These inflatable curtains were designed to deploy in the event of a side impact 
crash to reduce the chance of head injury.  During the 2002 MY, Ford introduced the first 
generation of side curtain air bag that were designed to deploy in the event of a rollover crash 
      I- 10
(Figure I-9).  Ford introduced this rollover air bag curtain system as an option on the Explorer 
and Mercury Mountaineer and marketed it as the “Safety Canopy.”  
 
There are three important design differences between air bag curtains designed for rollover 
ejection mitigation as opposed to side impact protection.  The first difference is longer inflation 
duration.  The portion of a side impact crash when the air bag curtain can provide protection is 
less than a 0.1 seconds.  By contrast, rollover with multiple full vehicle rotations can last many 
seconds.  Ford claims that their “Safety Canopy” stay inflated for six seconds.  GM claims that 
their side curtain air bags designed for rollover protection maintain 80% inflation pressure for 5 
seconds.  The side curtains on the 2005 and later Honda Odyssey stay inflated for 3 seconds.

Figure I-9    2002 Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer  
The second important air bag curtain design difference between side impact and rollover 
protection is the size or coverage of the air bag curtain.  GM claims that their curtains designed 
for rollover protection are larger than non-rollover curtains.  One of the most obvious trends in 
newer vehicles is the increasing area of coverage for rollover curtains.   Third, the rollover 
curtain must be tethered tightly the lower part of the air bag to vehicles’ A- and C-pillars. 
 
Figure I-10 shows the side curtain for the 2006 Ford Expedition/Navigator.  For the 2003 to 2006 
models this was optional on the Expedition and standard on the Navigator.  It is not much 
different from that of the original 2002 Explorer/Mountaineer.  Ford claimed that these systems 
covered two-thirds to 80% of the first two rows of windows.  Compare this to the 2007 Ford 
Expedition/Navigator system shown in Figure I-11, the coverage is much more complete in the 
new vehicles and extends to the third row.  However, it still appears as if the second rollover 
curtain does not extend to the sill.  The 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe has extensive coverage as well 
(Figure I-12).

II BACKGROUND     
Previous Agency Efforts on Rollover Mitigation:  
NHTSA has been active in rollover8 crash rulemaking and research for 30 years.  The NHTSA 
Authorization Act of 1991 (part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) 
required the agency to address several vehicle safety subjects through rulemaking, including 
protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars and light trucks.  In January 
1992, NHTSA published an ANPRM and a Technical Assessment Paper (57 FR 242).  The 
ANPRM soliciting information concerning rollover crashes, to assist the agency in planning a 
course of action on several rulemaking alternatives, supplementing the ANPRM.  The Technical 
Assessment Paper discussed testing activities, testing results, crash data collection, and analysis 
of the data. 
  
During the development of the ANPRM and after receiving and analyzing comments to the 
ANPRM, it became obvious that no single type of rulemaking could solve all, or even a majority 
of, the problems associated with rollover.  Subsequently, a Rulemaking Plan titled "Planning 
Document for Rollover Prevention and Injury Mitigation Docket 91-68 No. 1" was published for 
public review on September 29, 1992, (57 FR 44721).  The Planning Document gave an 
overview of the rollover problem and a list of alternative actions that NHTSA was examining to 
address the problem.  Activities described in that document were:  
1) Crash avoidance research on vehicle measures for rollover resistance;  
2) Research on antilock brake effectiveness;  
                                                          
8 As used in this document rollover refers to a lateral rollover or a vehicle rotation about its longitudinal axis.  
 
     II- 2
3) Rulemaking on upper interior padding to prevent head injury;  
4) Research into improved roof crush resistance to prevent head and spinal injury; 
5) Research on improved side window glazing and door latches to prevent occupant 
ejection; and  
6) Consumer information to alert people to the severity of rollover crashes and the 
benefits of safety belt use in this type of crash.  
In 1994, NHTSA terminated rulemaking to establish a minimum standard.  In May 1996, 
NHTSA issued the “Status Report for Rollover Prevention and Injury Mitigation.”  This 
document updated the progress of the programs discussed in the Planning Document. 
  
Side Window Area Ejection Mitigation by Glazing Use:       
NHTSA published two ANPRMs in 1988 announcing that the agency was considering the 
proposal of requirements for passenger vehicles intended to reduce the risk of ejections in 
crashes where the side protection of the vehicle was a relevant factor.  One notice (53 FR 31712) 
dealt with passenger cars.  The other notice (53 FR 31716) dealt with light trucks.   
  
The agency reported at the time, based on the 1982-1985 Fatality Analysis Reporting System 
(FARS), each year 19.5 percent of the occupant fatalities were the result of complete ejection 
through glazing and 4.3 percent were the result of partial ejection through glazing.  Data 
presented indicated that a large percentage of these ejections were through the side windows and 
that ejected occupants were at greater risk of fatality or serious injury. 
  
     II- 3
NHTSA believed that new side window designs, incorporating different glazing/frames, had the 
potential to reduce the risk of ejections.  At that time, NHTSA suggested that one performance 
approach would be to use an 18 kg (40 lb) glazing impact device, requiring that it not penetrate 
the plastic layer of a side window at 32 km/h (20 mph), an estimated typical contact speed.  
Numerous comments were received on the 1988 ANPRM.  Major issues were raised concerning 
the proposal, primarily that the safety benefits were not quantified.  Others were that the injury 
criteria were not specified for side impact, the practicability of glazing designs were questioned 
and had never been demonstrated, the cost was high, and there was no objective and repeatable 
test procedure proposed.  Finally, the comments questioned what effect ejection mitigating 
glazing would have on overall occupant injuries and fatalities, and whether this material would 
actually increase injuries to belted occupants. 
  
As mentioned above, as a result of the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991, a planning document 
was created containing a research plan for ejection mitigation through the use of glazing.  Public 
comments on the glazing program questioned design practicability, the lack of standardized 
testing, and the potential for additional contact injuries.  
 
In November 1995, NHTSA issued a report titled “Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced 
Glazings: A Status Report.”9 This report documented the size of the problem of vehicle 
occupants being ejected through first row side glazing.  The report also described testing 
NHTSA had done with a prototype glazing system using modified door and glazing materials. 
                                                          
9  “Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced Glazings: A Status Report,” November 1995, Docket No. NHTSA-1996-
1782-3.  
     II- 4
Based on this testing, NHTSA developed some estimates of potential benefits that could be 
associated with advanced side glazing.  
 
NHTSA followed this with another report in August 1999 titled “Ejection Mitigation Using 
Advanced Glazings: Status Report II.”10  This report updated several aspects of the previous 
research.  First, a more current door/glazing system was evaluated.  Second, a series of sled tests 
were conducted to attempt to evaluate the potential for neck injury from the use of advanced 
glazing systems.  Third, additional tests were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using some 
impactor component tests.  Fourth, the benefit-analysis was updated to include more recent data 
and to respond to comments received on the 1995 report.  
 
In NHTSA’s fiscal year 2001 Appropriations, Congress noted that NHTSA had been looking at 
advanced side glazing since 1991, and directed NHTSA to complete and issue a final report on 
advanced side glazing.  That report was published in August 2001 and titled “Ejection Mitigation 
Using Advanced Glazing: Final Report.”11  
 
The report concluded that advanced side glazing has the potential to yield significant safety 
benefits by reducing partial and complete ejections through side windows, particularly in 
rollover crashes.  Further, it found that the safety benefits are not unique to advanced glazing 
systems; other safety countermeasures can also prevent ejections.  Finally, it was decided that 
glazing systems should be evaluated as one component of a comprehensive ejection prevention

and mitigation strategy that includes alternate ejection countermeasures such as the more recent 
developments in inflatable head protection and/or rollover protection systems.  
     
Recent and Current Activities: Rollover NCAP, Rollover IPT, and R/OPCT  
In 2002-2003 timeframe, NHTSA began the sponsorship of five Integrated Project Teams (IPT) 
targeting the Administration’s priority areas.  In June 2003, the rollover IPT12 published its final 
report (68 FR 36534).  The crashworthiness topics specifically addressed in the rollover IPT 
Report were ejection mitigation and roof crush.  The ejection mitigation program was further 
divided into three phases.  Phase I was the then-ongoing FMVSS No. 214 upgrade implementing 
an oblique pole test, Phase II was development of an occupant containment countermeasure test 
and Phase III was development of test(s) for sensor systems to detect rollover crashes.  
 
The Relationship between the FMVSS No. 214 Pole Test and Ejection Mitigation  
On December 4, 2003, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (Alliance) and the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) announced a new voluntary commitment to enhance 
occupant protection in front-to-side and front-to-front crashes.  The industry initiative consisted 
of improvements and research in several phases, focusing on, among other things, accelerating 
the installation of side impact air bags (SIAB).  As part of the agreement the manufacturers may 
choose to install inflatable curtains.  The voluntary commitment will therefore increase the 
offering of the inflatable curtain as standard equipment.  According to the agreement, SIAB will 
be installed on widespread basis (at least 50%) by 2007 with full implementation by 2009.

     II- 6
On September 11, 2007, NHTSA published a final rule to upgrade FMVSS No. 214, 72 FR 
51908, Docket NHTSA-29134; Petitions for reconsideration, 3 FR 32473, Docket NHTSA-
2008-0104.  Part of the proposal introduced a pole impact for the front seating positions.  The 
pole impacts the vehicle at 75 degrees from the longitudinal plane and is positioned to strike the 
test dummy’s head.  The test is performed with a 5th percentile female dummy in a full forward 
position and a 50th percentile male dummy in the mid track position.  The preamble stated that 
the regulation was the first step in the agency’s goal of reducing the risk of vehicle ejection.  The 
agency believed that the potential countermeasures, i.e., torso-head combination air bags and 
side curtains, would provide a certain degree of ejection mitigation through the side windows, 
during the side impacts in which they would deploy.  The benefits estimate for that regulation 
included reduction of partial side window ejected occupants in side impacts.  However, the 
benefits estimate did not include complete ejections.  Any impact where a rollover was the first 
event was excluded from the analysis.  Crashes where a rollover was a subsequent event were 
included, but only for fatalities. Benefits were only assumed for side impact crashes with ΔV 
between 19.2 and 40.2 km/h and impact directions from 2 to 3 o’clock and 9 to 10 o’clock.

III. TEST DATA AND ANALYSIS OF LINEAR IMPACTOR HEADFORM TEST DATA   
This chapter presents test data available to the agency on the guided linear impactor headform 
test. 
   
The agency is proposing that the occupant containment countermeasure be tested by impact from 
a guided 18 kg featureless headform traveling from the inside the vehicle towards the outside, 
laterally and horizontally.  The proposed test requires that each side window, for up to three 
vehicle rows, be impacted at any of four locations referenced to the edges of the window 
opening.  Two impact velocities (16 and 24 km/h) are used in the test: the 16 km/h impact will 
occur 6 seconds after air bag deployment and the 24 km/h impact will occur 1.5 seconds after air 
bag deployment. 
  
As part of the agency’s research effort, a series of linear impactor headform tests were performed 
with OEM and prototype ejection mitigation air bags.  The test results and the proposed test 
procedure used are discussed in the following section.    
  
A. Impactor  
Dimensional Characteristics: The featureless head form (headform) was developed to be a free-
motion head form for use in interior impact testing.  The width and height dimensions as well as 
the contour of the head form face were chosen based on biomechanical data from mid-sized adult 
males.  The impacting face of the head form is intended to have dimensions which are the 
average of the front and side of a human head. 
  
    III- 2
The head form outer surface dimensions are given in Figure III-1.  The curvature of the upper 
right quadrant of the outer surface is given by the equation:  
(Y/88.4 mm)2 + (Z/113.0 mm)2 = 1 [Y/3.48 in.)2 + (Z/4.45 in.)2] = 1 
This equation is valid in the first quadrant only (top half), but the bottom half is symmetric about 
the X-axis. The rest of the shell is generated by rotating the curve ± 90 degrees about the Z-axis. 
For the inner shell (drawing not shown), the curvature of the upper right quadrant is given by the 
equation:  
(Y/77.0 mm)2 + (Z/101.6 mm)2 = 1 [(Y/3.03 in.)2 + (Z/4.0 in.)2 = 1]  
 
 
Figure III-1. Front and Side View of Headform Outer Surface (right) with Dimensions given in 
Millimeters.  
 
Mass Characteristics: The 18 kg mass of the guided impactor was developed through a series of 
pendulum tests, sled tests and computer modeling.  The head form also has the moment of inertia 
characteristics of the front and side of the head.  However, these characteristics do not come into 
play when it is used as the leading face of a guided impactor.      
    III- 3
 
A series of pendulum impact tests were conducted on a BioSID Anthropomorphic Test Device to 
measure effective mass of the head and shoulder.  The BioSID was chosen because it is 
configured for side impact, unlike the Hybrid-III dummy, and has a shoulder which is not present 
in the SID test dummy used for FMVSS No. 214 – Side Impact Protection.  A linear impact 
pendulum weighing 23.4 kg (51.5 lb) was used in all pendulum tests.  The head and shoulder 
were struck laterally (perpendicular to the midsagittal plane) in separate tests, using two impact 
speeds (9.7 and 12.9 km/h) and four impact surfaces.  In addition to the rigid impactor face, three 
types of padding were added to the impactor face to increase the contact time representative of 
advanced glazing impacts.  Example plots are shown in Figure III-2.  
 
 
Figure III-2.  Example plots of effective mass for 9.7 km/h velocity foam covered pendulum 
impacts with the dummy head and shoulder. 
    III- 4
 
Effective mass was calculated by dividing the force time history calculated from the pendulum 
accelerometers and dividing this by the acceleration time history from the dummy sensors.  In 
general, higher speed impacts and impacts with softer surfaces generated higher effective mass.  
The graphs for the effective mass of the head impact show an immediate rise to 5 kg in less than 
5 ms, when only the head is interacting with the pendulum, followed by a slow rise to values 
between 10 and 18 kg as the torso becomes affected prior to 20 ms.  The shoulder impacts 
showed artificially high values of calculated effective mass prior to about 5 ms because of a lag 
between the force measured in the pendulum and the acceleration measured at the upper spine.  
After the spike the effective mass was 16 to 18 kg, followed by a rise to 25 to 27 kg at 20 ms 
after impact.  Finally, there is a more rapid rise to values around 90 kg by 40 ms when, 
presumably, a more substantial percentage of the torso and lower body were affected. Based on 
these tests a range for the effective mass of the head and shoulders was estimated to be 16 to 27 
kg. 
 
In summary, the impactor mass was based on the determination of an effective mass calculated 
through both pendulum and sled test impacts.  Sled tests designed to represent both side impacts 
and rollover impacts gave similar energies and two equivalent mass estimates.  The 18 kg 
equivalent mass was seen during the test intended to be more representative of a rollover event.  
This was also the equivalent mass calculated from pendulum impact into the dummy shoulder.  
Thus, the 18 kg equivalent mass is considered a reasonable representation of an occupants head 
and a portion of the torso.  An equivalent mass more representative of just the head would be 
substantially smaller and an equivalent mass accounting for more torso and lower body mass 
    III- 5
would be substantially more.  The 18 kg mass is well within the effective mass GM estimated 
from vehicle rollover tests.  Both GM and Ford indicated that their internal test procedures used 
to evaluate side curtains utilizes an 18 kg guided impactor.13  In a meeting held with the 
Alliance, they also indicated a potential test procedure might utilize an 18 kg impactor.14 
B. Number and Locations of Impactor Test Targets  
Number of Target Locations per Glazing Area: In examining current side window designs, four 
targets seem sufficient to assure side window coverage for the vast majority of designs. The 
number of targets can be less than four if the window area is small enough to create significant 
overlap in the target locations.  
Side Window Opening: The target locations are defined in reference to the side window opening, 
with a 25 mm offset from that opening.15  We will use the definition of “daylight opening” found 
in FMVSS No. 201.16   In addition, we propose to exclude any flexible gasket material or 
weather striping used to create a waterproof seal between the glazing and the vehicle interior, 
from this definition.17        
                                                          
13 Ford presentation at SAE Government/Industry Meeting, Washington, D.C., May 9, 2006. 
14 Alliance presentation to NHTSA, Washington, D.C., January 25, 2006. [Docket NHTSA-2006-26467] 
15 The rationale for the 25 mm offset for the head form edge relates to the potential inaccuracy of the linear 
impactor.  Although the impactor is guided, it is not possible to always have it strike exactly where intended. As will 
be discussed later, we will allow a ± 10 mm tolerance on the impact location as well as ± 2 mm for locating the 
offset line and ± 2 mm for locating the target tangent to the offset line. Thus, a 25 mm offset from the window 
daylight opening (minus gasket) gives us 11 mm of buffer to assure that the impactor will not be restrained by the 
window frame structure. 
16 FMVSS No. 201 defines “daylight opening” as: Other than a door opening, the locus of all points where a 
horizontal line, perpendicular to the vehicle longitudinal centerline, is tangent to the periphery of the opening, 
including the area 50 mm inboard of the window glazing, but excluding any flexible gasket material or weather 
striping used to create a waterproof seal between the glazing and the vehicle interior. 
17 The rationale for the exclusion of this flexible material is that the targeting strategy already allows for a 25 mm 
boundary between the window opening edge and the head form edge.  Adding to this additional flexible edge 
material would move the impactor target even further inward from the potential ejection opening.  In addition, we 
have placed a limit on how close the target location can be before one of the target locations is eliminated, so there is 
a desire to keep the target locations close to the window edge.  Finally, it is not likely that flexible waterproofing 
would provide ejection mitigation. 
    III- 6
Rearward Limit on Target Area: The agency is limiting the impact testing to the side window 
daylight openings adjacent to no more than three rows of occupant seating. Furthermore, within 
the first three seating rows, we are proposing that for any side window opening that extends 
rearward of the rearmost forward-facing designated seating position, the rearward edge of the 
side window opening is defined by a vertical lateral vehicle plane 600 mm behind the (Seating 
Reference Point (SgRP) of the last row or 3rd row of seats.  We note that, as far as the number of 
rows of coverage, all light vehicle rollover occupants in the target population for this proposal 
were ejected through the first three side window rows.18  
  
Method for Determining Impactor Target Locations: The target locations were selected to ensure 
the procedure is objective and repeatable in assessing full window coverage.  In addition, the 
targeting method/procedure is simple and straight forward.  The following procedure is used for 
determining impactor target locations:  The first step in determining the impactor target locations 
is to find the corners of the window opening.  For example, Figure III-2 shows the side window 
daylight opening for the front and rear windows of a typical vehicle.  The offset line is 25 
millimeters inside the daylight opening.  The projection of the head form in the vehicle vertical 
longitudinal plane represents the outline of the impactor target.  A corner is defined as any 
location within the daylight opening where the impactor target outline is tangent to the offset line 
at two points.  Figure III-2 shows target outlines placed in the corners of the opening.  
 
                                                          
18 Third and higher row window are not specifically coded as ejection routes in NASS, so the other window category 
was reviewed.  This category contained only a limited number of 3rd row window ejections (about 1% of fatalities 
and MAIS 3+ injuries). 
    III- 7
 
Figure III-3.  Target Outlines Placed in Corners of Opening. 
The next step in the target location process requires that the geometric center of the daylight 
opening be identified.  This is then used to separate the opening into four quadrants, e.g., lower-
front, lower-rear, upper-front and upper-rear.  Third, determine the quadrant that each target 
outline center is located within.  For the front window, eliminate any target whose center is not 
within (inclusive of the border between quadrants) the lower-front and upper-rear quadrants.  For 
all rear window openings, eliminate any target whose center is not within the upper-front and 
lower-rear quadrants (inclusive of the border).  If there is more than one target left in the primary 
target quadrants, maintain the lowest target in the lower quadrants and the highest targets in the 
upper quadrants.  If there are no target centers within the quadrant, use the target whose center is 
closest to the quadrant.  This process leaves the targets shown in Figure III-3.  
 
 
    III- 8
 
Figure III-3. Target Whose Center Is Closest to Quadrant  
The final step is to locate additional targets for each daylight opening positioned in reference to 
the primary targets.  To locate the additional targets, the horizontal distance between the centers 
of the primary targets is measured.  These distances are shown as A and B for the front and rear 
window in Figure III-4, respectively.  Vertical lines are drawn at horizontal distances A/3 and 
B/3 from the primary target locations.  For the front window area, a secondary target is centered 
at a rearward horizontal distance A/3 from the lower-front primary target and moved vertically 
upward until contact is made with the offset line.  Another secondary target is centered at a 
forward horizontal distance A/3 from the upper-rear primary target and moved vertically 
downward until contact is made with the offset line.  For all other windows except the front, a 
secondary target is centered at a rearward horizontal distance B/3 from the upper-front primary 
target and moved vertically downward until contact is made with the offset line.  Another 
secondary target is centered at a forward horizontal distance B/3 from the lower-rear primary 
target and moved vertically upward until contact is made with the offset line.

Method for Target Reduction for Small Windows: Figure III-7 represents the daylight opening of 
a 2006 MY Toyota Camry.  Note that there is a small window area to the rear of a larger rear 
window area often referred to as a sail panel.  This is typical of many two door passenger cars. 
For many of these cars this window area is too small to accommodate an impactor.  However, for 
two door passenger cars these sail panels can be large enough to be impacted.  Many SUVs also 
have relatively small oddly shaped window areas, which are large enough to fit an impactor.  
 
Figure III-5 Small Window Area 
    III- 10
Figure III-5 shows how a relatively small triangular daylight opening would be targeted.  It is 
clear that as a window gets smaller it is not necessary to have 4 impact locations.  We are 
proposing a strategy that uses the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (z-axis) distances between 
target centers to determine their elimination.  The strategy is as follows:   
(1) The four target locations are determined as described above, with two of the 
targets being primary and two being secondary, as shown in Figure III-7. 
(2) Determine the horizontal and vertical distance between the centers of the 
secondary targets. 
(3) If the horizontal distance is less than 135 mm and the vertical distance is less 
than 170 mm, eliminate the upper secondary target.  
Reconstitution of Targets: For many passenger cars the target locations will be such that the 
vertical separation of the targets will be smaller than the 170 mm limit required for target 
elimination.  Accordingly, if the primary targets are closer horizontally than 405 mm [3x135], 
the two secondary targets will be eliminated.  As a result, the window drops from having four 
crowded targets, to having only two with a relatively substantial separation between them.  
Therefore, we are proposing that if after the target elimination scheme is used, only two targets 
remain and they are more than 360 mm apart, one target be added back.  This added target will 
be centered such that it bisects a line connecting the centers of the two remaining targets. 
C. Window Position and Condition  
Window Position: Under the proposed test procedure, it is allowed to put windows in position 
(“up” position), but pre-broken.  That is, if a manufacturer incorporated advanced laminated 
glazing into their window, the window is allowed to be in place, but the glazing will be broken 
    III- 11
without deforming the laminate.19  Typically this advanced glazing is a three layer construction 
with a plastic laminate sandwiched between two pieces of tempered glass.20   
 
D. Testing OEM and Developmental Systems  
Testing Description: For several years, NHTSA has been testing side window curtain air bags 
and advanced glazing according to the proposed test procedure, except for some differences in 
the target locations.  Early on, prototype systems were evaluated. The inflatable device known as 
the Advanced Head Protection System (AHPS) developed by Zodiac Automotive US (formerly 
Simula Automotive Safety Devices, Inc.) was modified to provide more window coverage and 
was not vented.  It is essentially an inflatable tubular structure in combination with a woven 
material that extends over the window opening.  The TRW prototype is more akin to a typical air 
bag curtain and was fixed to the A- and B-pillars at its end points and along the roof rail, but not 
tethered.  Figure III-6 shows these prototypes on the Chevrolet CK pickup. The advanced glazing 
used on the CK pickup was a bi-laminate glazing, consisting of standard CK tempered glass with 
a plastic film bonded to inner surface, and a laminate construction, similar to windshields. The 
entire window edge was encapsulated.  
                                                          
19 .  The target population data showed that 69% of occupants were ejected through a front row window that was up 
prior to the crash. .The test procedure for pre-breaking advanced glazing has been developed by the agency and is 
part of the NPRM.  The agency is proposing a 50 mm spacing breakage pattern through the use of a spring-loaded 
center punch with a 5 ± 2 mm diameter prior to the tip, adjusted to an activation load of 150 ± 25 N load..  
20 We analyzed field data to determine the pre and post-crash window condition. One data set consisted of the 
window adjacent to an occupant in a rollover. This data set had 2.9 million weighted entries. Another data set 
consisted of the window through which an occupant was ejected in the target population for the proposed standard. 
This was a much smaller data set, with only about 21,000 weighted entries. The larger data set indicated that 86% of 
front windows were up prior to a crash. The target population data showed that 69% of occupants were ejected 
through a front row window that was up prior to the crash. For the larger data set, of the front windows that were up 
before the crash, 45% were broken after the crash. For the target population, nearly all the pre-crash closed windows 
were broken after the crash.

Figure III-6 Prototype Zodiac (left) and TRW (right) air bag curtains on CK pickup.  
 
The OEM curtain systems tested had either standard or optional rollover sensors.  All OEM air 
bag curtains were top mounted.  Any laminates tested were marketed as theft protection and not 
as a form of ejection mitigation.21  
 
The target locations shown in Figure III-6 were determined by the proposed method.  As stated 
above, exclusive of the Honda Odyssey, for all tests of prototype systems and OEM system 
through the 2005 model year (MY05), the method for determining the target location was 
slightly different than currently being proposed.  We will refer to this as the research target 
method as opposed to the proposed target method.  Below we will briefly explain the differences 
between the methods.  Although not quantified, we believe that the target shifts were small 
                                                          
21 Mark P. Gold, Manager, Applications Development Solutia Inc. stated “Laminated glass has been shown to 
provide up to 10 times the penetration resistance of standard tempered glass, and enhanced versions, such as that 
used in the GM-610 van, can resist up to 2 minutes of aggressive attack by an intended intruder or thief.  The FBI's 
Uniform Crime Report (http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_23.html) shows that in 2005 over 1.3 million 
thefts were reported from vehicles in the United States, with losses valued nearly $900 million from these thefts 
(average loss $691 per occurrence).  Additionally  500,000 losses of motor vehicle accessories valued at over $235 
million and the theft of over 973,000 motor vehicles valued at over $6 billion were tallied in this report.  Although 
police documentation shows that almost 50% of vehicle thefts and break-ins occur through the vehicle's side 
windows we leave it to your judgment as to how to account for this $7,143,000,000 annual security benefit that 
would result from the use of laminated side glazing,” May 8, 2007, via e-mail.

enough that data using the research target method can be reasonably compared to the proposed 
target method. The MY05 Odyssey was targeted by the proposed method.  
 
The difference in determining the target location had the most effect on A2, A3, B1 and B4. The 
resulting shift in target location was a function of the window shape. The primary difference in 
the research target method was that A3 was found by the bisecting the angle produced by the 
intersection of a line parallel to the A-pillar and roof rail, which in the case of the window in 
Figure III-6, would shift A3 rearward and upward. Since A2 is located horizontally midway 
between A3 and A4 in both the research and proposed target methods, A2 in the research method 
would be rearward of the A2 position shown in Figure III-6.  
 
The rear window data for prototype and OEM system through MY05 is, for the most part, 
limited to B1 and B4. Under the research method used to find the target locations, B1 was at the 
lower sill, in the middle of the window and B4 was in the upper rear corner. Again, under the 
research method, B1 and B4 would likely be shifted forward from the location shown in Figure 
III-7. For the test of the Zodiac prototype on the Navigator, extra targets were impacted. For only 
this vehicle, Tables III-1 through III-3 present an average result from two impacts that were on 
either side of the proposed targets B1 and B4.  
 
Figure III-7 Target Location Determined by Proposed Method  
    III- 14
 
Test Results: The results of the testing are given in Tables III-1 through III-7.  The results are 
given in columns, by target location.  The tabulated results are shade/color coded.  Any values 
exceeding the proposed 100 mm limit on impactor displacement is in (purple or) the darkest 
shading.  Results from 80 to 100 mm are (gold or) medium shading.  Results which are less than 
80 mm are in (green or) the lightest shading.  
  
Although the agency is proposing a 24 km/h impact at 1.5 seconds after air bag deployment, 
research data was acquired at 20 km/h and also 16 km/h to determine the sensitivity to impact 
speed.  Several ejection mitigation systems were not tested at 24 km/h at every target location 
because the 20 km/h results indicated displacements in excess of 100 mm at that location.  The 
cell shading (purple/dark) assumes the 24 km/h impact would also have exceeded 100 mm.  
Similarly, some target locations were not tested at 20 km/h, but the cell is shaded (green/light) 
indicating a value below 80 mm of displacement because the 24 km/h impact was less than  
80 mm.    
 
Tables III-1 through III-3 show the results for vehicle front windows.  For all three sets of tests, 
A1 (front lower corner) was the most challenging target and A4 (upper rear corner) was the least 
challenging.  For the 24 km/h test the only system that did not exceed the 100 mm criterion at A1 
was the Zodiac Prototype on the CK pickup.  At 20 km/h, the MY05 Infinity had one test result 
of 99 mm and another of 106 mm at A1.  For the 16 km/h - 6 second delay test, two OEM 
systems and two prototype systems had displacements slightly above or less than 100 mm at A1.  
No displacement at A4 exceeded 76, 73 or 67 mm at 24, 20 and 16 km/h, respectively.  Taken as 
    III- 15
a whole, A2 and A3 showed similar results to each other for all three test conditions.  The trends 
for severity by target location are the same for the 16 km/h - 6 second delay impacts.

The 2nd row window data in Tables III-4 through III-7 are much more limited, with nearly all 
the data at B1 and B4.  In general, these data indicate target location B1 is more challenging than 
B4.  The exception to this is the Dodge Durango, which performed well at all 2nd row targets. 
For the 24 km/h test at B1, three of the ejection mitigation systems tested had displacements that 
did not exceed 100 mm.  For the 20 and 16 km/h test at B1, a total of 3 systems did not exceed 
100 mm.  We expect that the Durango would not have exceeded 100 mm at this speed, since it 
did not exceed 100 mm at 24 km/h. At B4, three systems had displacements that exceeded 100 
mm. This was reduced to one system for the 20 and 16 km/h impacts.

22 Note that any cell listed as “To Stops” indicates a displacement of the impactor to the point were the mechanical 
stops of the device keep it from further movement.  This occurred for the MY03 Navigator at B1 at 24 and 20 km/h.  
This indicates the bag has a very little coverage at this location.

Figure III-8 summarizes the displacement data at each target location, by test type.  The data at 
each target has been averaged.  However, test results from a target location were excluded from 
the average if the test was not done at each impact speed.  For example, the average at A1 is 
derived from only four ejection mitigation systems.  This graph reinforces trends seen in the 
tabulated data for the system evaluated to date, i.e., the 24 km/h - 1.5 second delay test is the 
most stringent.  For all except target locations B2 and B3, the 16 km/h - 6 second delay test had 
the least average impactor displacement.  However, the comparative data for targets B2 and B3 
had only two and one vehicle, respectively.  
    III- 20

In summary, the headform test results show that almost all the curtain systems met the 
requirement in the 16 km/h at 6 second delay test.  However, the data show that meeting the  
100 mm displacement requirement at 24 km/h is more challenging especially at targets A1, B1 
and B2.  When the opening is covered, the results indicate that most of currently available 
rollover curtain air bags are capable of retaining the headform within 120 mm.23   
 
                                                          
23 We do not have data to fully analyze the effects of increasing the displacement limit from 100 mm to 120 mm.  
Hypothetically, if a bag is long enough to provide a tension load just above the headform such that its reaction force 
aligns with the direction of the headform, as illustrated in Figure IV-4, the proposed 100 mm requirement would 
result in a 182 mm (7.2 inches) potential gap under the curtain (below the tension line).  When the 100 mm 
displacement increases to 120 mm, the potential gap would increase to 194 mm (7.6 inches).    
     IV- 1 
IV. BENEFITS  
This chapter estimates the potential benefits of the proposed occupant retention requirements.  
These benefits would be achieved from providing window curtains or other countermeasures that 
would meet the required guided linear impactor test.  The benefit calculations are based on 
limited laboratory tests and real world crash data.  The process and theory are presented in the 
method section.     
 
The benefit analysis is categorized into two groups: (1) benefits from fatality reduction, and (2) 
benefits from non-fatal MAIS 3-5 injury mitigation.24  The general procedure is to first identify 
the baseline target population and then to estimate the fatal or injury reduction rate.  Real world 
crash data, laboratory test results and other relevant test data are used to calculate fatal and 
serious non-fatal injury reduction rates.  The injury reduction rates are applied to the 
corresponding target population, which results in fatality or injury reduction benefits. 
 
Overview of fatal and non-fatal injuries in real world crashes: The agency’s annualized injury 
data from 1997 to 2005 NASS CDS and fatality counts adjusted to 2005 FARS levels show that 
ejection through side windows makes up the greatest part of the ejection problem.25  There are 
6,174 fatalities, 5,271 MAIS 3+ non-fatal injuries, and 18,353 MAIS 1-2 injuries for occupants 
                                                          
24 We believe that rollover curtain bags are effective in preventing MAIS 1 & 2 injuries.  However, the oblique pole 
and our moving barrier test results show that some of serious and fatal injuries prevented would result in AIS 1 or 2 
injuries.  For example, at 18 mph occupant delta-V (which would be observed in the 20 mph vehicle delta-V oblique 
pole test), the resulting HIC was about 550 with a canopy (curtain) bag.  At this HIC level, there are 39% and 30% 
risk of receiving AIS 1 and 2 head injuries, respectively.  In that analysis, due to limited data, we did not consider 
these “trickled-down” dis-benefits.  Some of these “trickled-down” disbenefits would offset the MAIS 1 & 2 
potential benefits. Neither have we considered these trickled-down disbenfits for this ejection mitigation 
25 In the benefit analysis, we used annualized injury data from 1997 to 2005 NASS CDS and fatality counts adjusted 
to 2005 FARS levels to analyze ejection routes.  All unknowns have been distributed, and all crashes types were 
included.  However, the counts are restricted to ejection occupants that were injured.  In addition the final target 
population included only crashes where the curtain air bag would be expected to deploy. 
     IV- 2 
ejected through side windows.  These make up 61%, 47% and 68% of all ejected fatalities, 
MAIS 3+ non-fatal and MAIS 1-2 injuries, respectively, as shown in Tables IV-1 and IV-2.

Tables IV-1 and IV-2 show that side windows are the most common ejection routes.26  In 
particular, real world crash data show that ejection is the largest safety problem for occupant 
                                                          
26 In addition, the crash data showed that the front row window through which an occupant was ejected was closed 
or fixed prior to the crash 69% of the time.

protection in rollover crashes.27  Among the 6,174 occupants who were killed when they were 
ejected from vehicles through side windows,28 3,668 were occupants who were ejected through 
the side window opening in rollover crashes, 462 were from side impacts followed by rollover, 
and 1,568 were side impacts without subsequent rollover (planar-only).29  The remaining 476 
were from front and rear planar-only crashes and other rollovers.   
 
If ejection is eliminated in these crashes, a substantial number of lives would be saved.  Winnicki 
reported that the relative risk of fatalities of ejected to non-ejected drivers in all ejection crashes 
is 3.55 for drivers and 3.15 for front seat passengers.30  This translated into 72 percent and 68 
percent reductions in fatalities when ejection is eliminated, respectively.  An analysis by vehicle 
type shows that a particularly large ejection risk for drivers of light trucks, which have a 5.62 
relative risk or an 82 percent reduction in fatalities for non-ejected drivers. 
  
The hypothetical ejection mitigation system used for the analysis is based on current and 
potential curtain air bag technologies.  The hypothetical system would prevent occupants in front 
and rear seating positions31 from ejection in some rollover and side crashes,32 as most curtain air 
                                                          
27 J. Winnicki, “Estimating the Injury-Reducing Benefits of Ejection Mitigation Glazing,” February 1996, Docket 
Number NHTSA-1996-1782-18, DOT HS 808 369.  
28 Among these fatalities, 6,115 were from occupants in the 1st and 2nd rows and the remaining 59 fatalities were 
from the 3rd row.   
29 For the fatal and non-fatal serious injuries in side crashes, we included both near-side and far-side occupants. 
30 DOT HS 808 369. 
31 For vehicles with third row seats, the analysis assumes that the system provides the same protection for occupants 
in the front and the rear rows.  However, for third row windows, a laminated glass could be used for these non-
removable windows, as the laminated glass is bonded to the frame of the window using urethane.  The urethane 
bonding is also being used by manufacturers for the front windshield.  Although the agency does not have sufficient 
data to determine its effectiveness, we believe that a laminate glass would provide an equivalent safety protection 
for third row windows based on the material and design used.  Although laminated glazing would be effective for 
non-removable 2nd or 3rd row windows, it would be far less effective for removable windows.  In a SAE technical 
report titled “A Comparative Study of Automotive Side Window Occupant Containment Characteristics for 
Tempered and Laminated Glass,” No. 2006-01-1492, one of the conclusions made was that both tempered side glass 
and laminate side glass could vacate the window opening such that an unrestrained occupant (and, possibly, portions 
     IV- 4 
bags are designed to deploy from vehicle’s roof rail.  Similar to the approaches used in the 
FMVSS Nos. 208 and 21433, we did not consider AIS 1& 2 (non-serious) injuries for the target 
population.  Accordingly, we limited our target population to fatal and serious non-fatal injuries 
in these crashes.                  
 
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: The first section establishes the baseline target 
population; the second section discusses the methodology used for deriving the reduction in fatal 
and serious injuries; the third section estimates benefits for improving occupant protection results 
from the proposed linear guided headform test.  The benefit summary section provides overall 
benefits in a table format; finally, the last section discusses any related issues that would affect 
the benefit estimate.       
 
Target population: A pre-2006 baseline target population was used to estimate benefits.  The 
target population is based on annualized injury data from 1997 to 2005 NASS CDS and fatality 
counts adjusted to 2005 FARS levels.  However, the counts are restricted to ejection occupants 
that were injured.34  Even though some proportion of these vehicles had side impact air bags, 
very few had rollover sensors.  The majority of these vehicles were not equipped with rollover 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
of a restrained occupant) could pass through the opening in rollovers.  According to the report, less than 11% of MY 
2006 vehicles are equipped with laminated side glass (27 models out of 251 models available). 
32 For the analysis, we assumed that vehicle manufacturers will install a single curtain system to cover the front and 
rear window opening areas, although it would be feasible to install two separate curtains to cover the openings.   
33 Docket’s: NHTSA-1997-3111 and NHTSA-2007-29134 
34 In NASS CDS, the ejection route for side windows is only explicitly coded for the front (Row 1 Window) and rear 
(Row 2 Window).  The third and higher row side window ejections should be coded as “other glazing.”  This is 
because there are specific codes available for coding roof glazing, windshield and backlight.  However, when 
extracting NASS cases of known ejections through “other glazing,” we observed 17 unweighted occupants.  A hard 
copy review of these cases showed that 9 were known 3rd row side window ejections, but five (5) cases were 
miscoded.  Four (4) were actually backlight ejections and one (1) was a sunroof ejection.  The known 3rd row 
ejections were recoded as “Row 3 Window” ejections.    
     IV- 5 
mitigation systems.35  The NHTSA linear headform test36 results show that these vehicles would 
not consistently meet the proposed 100 mm headform displacement requirement at all test 
positions.  For the analysis, the target population is defined as occupants who were ejected 
through the window openings and sustained MAIS 3+ (including fatalities) injuries in both 
rollovers and non-rollover side crashes.  For rollover crashes, complete and partial ejections were 
considered, whereas only complete ejections were considered in non-rollover 12-25 mph delta-V 
side crashes.37  We note that vehicles that are required to meet the proposed linear headform 
displacement requirement would also meet FMVSS No. 214 oblique pole test requirements.  In 
12-25 mph delta-V side crashes, vehicle’s side impact sensor would deploy the curtain.  
Although the majority of vehicles in the target population (pre-2006) were not equipped with an 
ejection mitigation system, several recent vehicle models (MY 2007, for example) have 
countermeasures designed to prevent occupants from ejection in rollover crashes.  Vehicle 
manufacturers plan to continuously increase the number of vehicles equipped with rollover air 
bags.  According to projected air bag sales, about 55% of all MY 2011 light vehicles will be 
equipped with rollover air bags when the phase-in of the proposed rule begins in September 1, 
2013.38  For the benefit analysis, we used the projected MY 2011 vehicle sales as a baseline.  
                                                          
35 Accordingly, we didn’t adjust the target population for the current effectiveness of rollover bags since there are so 
few of them on the road for the pre-2006 target population.   
36 The headform consists of a guided 18 kg mass.  Since it is a guided impactor, only uni-axial motion is measured 
during an impact.  The impactor is designed to be placed inside a vehicle for testing the side window areas and can 
be positioned to strike different locations on those areas.    
37 Potential benefits for protecting occupants who were partially ejected in non-rollover, 12-25 mph side crashes 
were included in the new FMVSS 214 benefit estimate (i.e., adding oblique pole test).  
38 The agency is proposing to phase-in the new ejection mitigation requirements starting the first September 1 three 
years from the date of publication of a final rule.  Assuming that a final rule would be issued prior to September 1, 
2010, the effective date would be September 1, 2013.  Although the agency prefers to use MY 2014 vehicle sales 
data as a baseline, the sales data were not available for this analysis.  As a result, we used the MY 2011 data. 
     IV- 6 
Potential benefits from these countermeasure systems were excluded from the incremental 
benefit estimate.39          
    
Subcategories of target population: There are four major crash categories: Planar (non-rollover 
crash), Rollover (crash were rotation about the vehicle longitudinal axis occurred during the 
crash sequence, regardless of whether or not a planar impact or rotation about some other vehicle 
axis occurred), End-Over-End (rotation about the vehicle lateral axis) and all Other (non-rollover 
crash).  These major crash types can be subcategorized further.  Planar crashes are Side, Front or 
Rear.  For our purposes, planar crashes were defined by using primary or first area of damage as 
a surrogate for impact direction.  As will be explained later, in order to prevent any overlap with 
the injury population used for the FMVSS No. 214 pole impact upgrade, it is also necessary for 
rollover crashes to be divided into those that were preceded by a side impact and all others.     
 
We expect ejection mitigation systems to deploy an ejection countermeasure in a rollover 
crash.40  If the ejection countermeasure is a side air bag curtain, we expect that this will deploy 
on the impact side in a side crash.  Therefore, at its most basic level, the target population for this 
proposal is derived from any crash involving a rollover or a side planar crash.  However it is 
necessary to make adjustments to this population.  The main reason for these adjustments is to 
account for benefits already attributed to the FMVSS No. 214 upgrade. 
                                                          
39 In the analysis we assumed that the performance of rollover bags remains unchanged in the future without the 
proposed ejection mitigation requirements.  Since some of the air bags would not meet the proposed requirements, 
the benefits and costs associated with these bags to meet the requirements were considered in the analysis, as 
discussed in the additional benefits section.  According to the MY 2011 vehicle sales data, about 94% of light 
vehicles will be equipped with curtain bags.  Among these curtain bag systems, approximately 58% will be equipped 
with rollover sensors.  (94% x 58% = 55%).   
40 A typical ejection mitigation system consists of a rollover sensor and two curtain air bags (one on each side).  As 
discussed in the system effectiveness section in this chapter, the senor would not be 100% effective in all rollover 
crashes.  In other words, we do not expect the sensor to detect all rollovers.  However, when the sensor detects a roll, 
we expect that it deploys an ejection countermeasure in a rollover crash.  
     IV- 7 
 
The benefits estimate for the new FMVSS No. 214 standard included partially ejected adult (13+ 
years) occupants in side impacts.  However, the benefits estimate did not include complete 
ejections.  Any impact where a rollover was the first event was excluded from the analysis.  
Crashes where a rollover was a subsequent event were included, but only for fatalities.  Benefits 
were only assumed for side impact crashes with ∆V between 19.2 and 40.2 km/h (12 and 25 
mph) and impact directions from 2 to 3 o’clock and 9 to 10 o’clock. 
 
To make sure our target population does not overlap with the one used for the FMVSS No. 214 
pole impact upgrade, we subcategorized our rollover crashes.  As indicated above, the two 
subcategories are rollovers proceeded by a side impact and all other rollovers.  These 
subcategories are then divided into impact delta-V (ΔV) ranges where appropriate.  Both the 
subcategories of side impact and rollover proceeded by side impact are separated into side 
impacts with delta-V between 19 to 40 km/h and all other side impacts.  No attempt is made to 
separate the data by direction of side impact as this is not necessary for the accurate 
determination of the target population of this proposed standard.  Next, the fatal and non-fatal 
serious injuries were discriminated, where necessary, by the ejected occupant’s age (0 – 12 or 
13+ years), ejection degree (partial or complete) and injury level (non-fatal or fatal). 
 
The FMVSS No. 214 upgrade accounted for partial ejections in side impacts with ΔV between 
19 and 40 km/h for all 13+ year occupants.  The Ejection Mitigation population covers all other 
ejected occupants in this side impact category.  The FMVSS No. 214 upgrade accounted for 
partial fatal ejections in side impacts with delat-V between 19 and 40 km/h that precede a 
     IV- 8 
rollover.  Thus, the non-fatal partial ejections and all complete ejections represented in this group 
are part of the Ejection Mitigation population.  All injuries and fatalities at other side impact 
delta-Vs that precede a rollover are also part of the Ejection Mitigation population.  Finally, any 
other crash with a rollover41 is counted in the Ejection Mitigation population.  The breakdown of 
the target population is shown in Table IV-3.

The results in Table IV-3 show that the target population for the ejection mitigation standard is 
4,395 fatalities and 4,250 MAIS 3-5 injuries.  In addition, when the target population was 
categorized by ejection row and belt use (Table IV-4), it shows that the majority of serious and 
fatal injuries were from completely ejected unbelted occupants in the first seating row.  
According to the 1997 – 2005 NASS and 2005 FARS data, about 53% of all serious injuries 
(2,243 MAIS 3-5) and 56%43 of all fatalities (2,459) in the target population were from 
completely ejected unbelted occupants in the first seating row:

41 We will refer to this part of the target population as rollover crashes for simplicity.  However, it includes any 
crash where the vehicle was coded as having rolled over in the crash sequence, except those preceded by a side 
impact. 
42 In the FMVSS No. 214 oblique-pole benefit analysis, any fatal and non-fatal injuries resulting from complete 
ejection were not included in the target population, whether the crashes were followed by rollovers or not.

For occupants who were ejected in rollover crashes not preceded by a side impact, there were a 
total of 3,668 fatalities and 3,564 MAIS 3+ non-fatal serious injuries in the target population.  
The crash data show that the majority of fatal and non-fatal serious injuries were from unbelted 
occupants who were completely ejected (4,652 out of 7,232), as shown below:

For occupants who were ejected in side crashes, as discussed, the side target population was 
categorized into three subgroups: (a) side impacts followed by rollover for all delta-V’s, 
excluding 12-25 mph delta-V’s (19 and 40 km/h); (b) side impacts followed by rollover for 
delta-V’s between 12 mph and 25 mph;44 and (c) side impacts without subsequent rollover for 
delta-V’s between 12 mph and 25 mph.  Each sub-target population is further discussed in the 
following section.  
                                                          
44 For side impacts followed by rollovers at delta-V’s lower than 12 mph, vehicle’s side impact sensors may not 
deploy the bag.  In this delta-V range, we assumed that rollover sensors would detect vehicle’s roll motion in time 
for crashes that would result in more than one-1/4 turn.  For non-rollover side crashes at delta-V’s higher than 25 
mph, we assumed that the structure of the vehicle would not withstand the impact, although rollover bags would be 
capable of preventing occupants from ejection.  In the 214 NPRM, the agency estimated that side head bags are not 
effective for lateral delta-V’s higher than 25 mph.   
     IV- 10 
 
(a) Side impacts followed by rollover for all but 12-25 mph delta-V’s: The crash data show that 
there were 155 partially ejected and 129 completely ejected occupant fatalities when all delta-
V’s are considered (a total of 284).45  The 155 were from unbelted occupants who were partially 
ejected, and the remaining 129 fatalities were from unbelted occupants who were completely 
ejected from vehicles.46  For MAIS 3-5 serious non-fatal injuries, there were 53 partially ejected 
and 174 completely ejected occupant injuries, a total of 227 serious injuries.  Among the 227 
serious injuries, about 37% (83) were from belted occupants and the others were from unbelted 
occupants.  The fatal and non-fatal serious injuries are shown below:

(b) Side impacts followed by rollover for delta-V’s between 12 and 25 mph: We estimated a total 
of 89 complete fatal ejections: 12 from belted occupants and 77 from unbelted occupants.48  For 
serious injuries, a total of 334 MAIS 3-5 injuries occurred: 116 partially ejected and 218 
completely ejected occupants, as shown below:   
 
                                                          
45 As discussed above, we excluded belted occupant fatalities from the target population.  In addition, according to 
agency’s 2000-2004 CDS, 2004 FARS and 2004 GES data, approximately 29.1% of all AIS injuries were from a 
delta-V range of 12 -25 mph in side crashes.   
46 As discussed, belted partial ejection fatalities were included in the 214 oblique pole target population but belted 
complete ejection fatalities were excluded from the target population.  
47 The injury numbers were rounded to the nearest integer. 
48 There were 87 partial and 89 complete fatal ejections in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph in side impacts followed by 
rollovers.  The 87 partial fatal ejections were considered in the 214-benefit estimate and were excluded from the 
analysis.  However, complete ejections (whether fatal or non-fatal serious injuries) were not considered in the 214-
benefit analysis.  Accordingly, only the 89 fatal complete ejections are considered in the analysis.

(c) Side impacts without subsequent rollover for delta-V’s between 12 mph and 25 mph: This 
subgroup was further divided by occupant age.  For adults (13+ years), there were 293 fatalities 
and 81 serious injuries in the subgroup, as shown in Tables IV-8 and -9.

We note that there were 562 fatalities from partially ejected occupants in the side crashes.51  As 
discussed, the benefits estimate for the new FMVSS No. 214 standard included reduction of 
partial side window ejected adult (13+ years) occupants in side impacts.  Accordingly, these 
fatalities were excluded from the ejection mitigation benefit analysis.  However, the FMVSS No 
214 benefits estimate did not include complete ejections, so they are included here.     
 
                                                          
49 The FMVSS No. 214-benefit analysis did not include seriously injured occupants who were partially ejected in 
side crashes (12 -25 mph delta-V’s) followed by rollovers.  These injuries were included in this analysis.  
50 The FMVSS No. 214-benefit analysis did not include seriously injured occupants who were partially ejected in 
side crashes (12 -25 mph delta-V’s) followed by rollovers.  These injuries were included in this analysis.  
51 There were 187 fatalities from belted and 375 fatalities from unbelted adult occupants who were partially ejected 
through side windows in side impacts without any subsequent rollover in a lateral delta-V range of 19.3 to 40.2 
km/h.  These fatalities were included in the 214-target population and, as a result, were not considered in the 
ejection mitigation benefits. 
     IV- 12 
In addition, children (0-12 years old) were previously excluded from the FMVSS No. 214-
benefit analysis because the majority of air bags that are in compliance with the 214 
requirements would not span either forward or low enough, specially the air chambers (although 
the webbing span forward in the window opening), to provide a sufficient contact surface with 
the head and other body regions.  Unlike the FMVSS No. 214-air bag, curtain air bags that are 
designed to meet the proposed linear headform test requirements would cover the entire window 
opening area in side impacts.  Therefore, the hypothetical rollover air bag would be effective in 
protecting children who are partially or completely ejected in side impacts in a delta-V range of 
12-25 mph.  There were a total of 61 fatalities and 44 serious injuries for children under 13 years 
old (0-12 years old), as shown in Table IV-9 and Figure IV-1.

Additional adjustments made to target population: In addition to the FMVSS No. 214-target 
population adjustment, several additional adjustments were made to the target population, as 
discussed below: 
 
1. Completely Ejected Belted Occupants: Although the ejection mitigation system could be 
effective in protecting belted occupants who are completely ejected in rollover crashes, these are 
typically very violent rollovers and we assumed that the structure would not withstand such 
crashes.  Accordingly, completely ejected belted occupants in rollover crashes were not 
considered for the benefit analysis.53  There were 69 fatally injured completely ejected belted 
occupants in rollover crashes, as shown in Table IV-4.54 
 
2. Electronic Stability Control (ESC) System: The agency’s real world crash data show that the 
ESC system is highly effective in preventing single vehicle side crashes and rollovers.  A 
statistical analysis of 1997-2004 FARS data and state data from calendar years 1997-2003 show 
that ESC is about 79% effective in preventing rollovers,55 as shown below: 
Table IV-10

53 Potential occupant mitigation benefits for adult occupants who were partially ejected in side crashes were 
analyzed in the 214-FRIA.  The potential benefits of the 214 rulemaking were excluded from the ejection mitigation 
benefits in the analysis. 
54 Among the 69 fatalities, 12 were from the side impact with subsequent rollover in a 19 to 40 km/h delta-V range 
(see Table IV-7) and the other 57 were from rollovers without side crashes (see Table IV-5).  For unbelted 
occupants, similar to the belted occupants, we excluded fatalities resulting from catastrophic rollover crashes.  The 
methodology used for the exclusion is discussed in the method section in this chapter.       
55 Note that (1) all the reductions are statistically significant at the 0.05 level, (2) the control group included crash 
involvements in which a vehicle: (i) was stopped, parked, backing up, or entering/leaving a parking space prior to 
the crash (ii) traveled at a speed less than 10 mph, (iii) was struck in the rear by another vehicle, or (iv) was a non-
culpable party in a multi-vehicle crash on a dry road.  
     IV- 14 
 
Based on the recently proposed ESC rulemaking, for the analysis, we assumed that all applicable 
new vehicles will be equipped with ESC before this rule is effective.56  When the target 
population from Table IV-5 is adjusted with the 79% effectiveness and the expected 100% 
installation rate, a total of 761 fatalities would occur in rollovers without any side crashes.  
Among the 761 fatalities, 218 would be from partial ejections and the remaining 542 would be 
from complete ejections, as shown below: 
Table IV-11

Belted 112 12 123
Unbelted 107 57531 637
total 218 542 761
* The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer. 
 
For side crashes with and without rollover target population, similar to the method used for the 
rollover target population, we adjusted the target population with potential ESC benefits.  In the 
FMVSS No. 214 FRIA, we estimated that ESC is about 41% and 6% effective for single vehicle 
crashes and multiple vehicle crashes, respectively, when both passenger cars and light 
trucks/SUVs are combined in fatal side crashes.  Since the combined target population from 
Tables IV-6 through IV-10 are not categorized by SVCs & MVCs, for the analysis, we weighted 
the effectiveness rates with the number of single and multiple side crashes used in the FMVSS 
No. 214 analysis.  According to the FMVSS No. 214 crash data, 16% of the fatal side crashes 
                                                          
56 Based on manufacturers’ product plans submitted to the agency, 71 percent of the MY 2011 light vehicles will be 
equipped with ESC.  However, under the FMVSS No. 126, “Electronic Stability Control Systems,” we expect all 
MY 2011 vehicles will be equipped with ESC.  In addition, since all 2012 and later model year (MY) light vehicles 
are required to meet the ESC requirements, 100% of all light vehicles would be equipped with ESC when the phase-
in of the proposed ejection mitigation rule begins in September 2013.  
57 When the unbelted complete ejection fatalities from catastrophic rollover crashes were excluded from the 531 
unbelted complete ejection fatalities, it resulted in 519 fatalities.  The methodology used for the adjustment is 
discussed in the method section in this chapter.  
     IV- 15 
were from single and the remaining 84% were from multiple vehicle crashes.  Based on the 
weighted data, we assumed that ESC is 12% effective in preventing side crashes. 58  The ESC

58 By applying the ESC effectiveness to the side impacts whether followed by rollovers or not, we are assuming that 
preventing the side impact would prevent subsequent rollovers.  However, we expect some of the subsequent 
rollovers could occur even if the side impact is prevented.  Therefore, by not including these un-prevented rollovers 
in the target population, we would slightly underestimate the potential benefits.  There were 2,311 near-side front 
occupant fatalities.  Among the 2,311 fatalities, 372 (16%) were from vehicle-to-narrow object and the remaining 
1,939 (84%) were front vehicle-to-vehicle/others in side crashes, in a delta-V range of 12 -25 mph (12% weighted 
ESC: 41%x16% + 6%x84% = 12%)

3. Vehicle Type: For the analysis, we did not separate occupant injuries by vehicle type.  The 
fatal and non-fatal serious injuries in the target population are from all light vehicle crashes, 
involving passenger cars, vans, SUVs, pickups, and utility vehicles, as shown below:

     IV- 17 
The results in Table IV-17 show that occupants in passenger cars have a lower probability of 
partial or complete fatal ejections through side windows (0.82 per 1,000) when compared to 
SUVs (1.78 per 1,000), vans (0.87 per 1,000), and pickup trucks (1.80 per 1,000).  Similar 
findings were reported by Winnicki.  He found that, in general, occupants in passenger cars have 
a lower relative risk of fatality when compared to front occupants in light trucks.59  By 
combining injuries from different vehicle types, we are assuming that the proportion of 
passenger cars or light trucks on the road remains unchanged when the proposed ejection 
mitigation requirement is fully implemented. 
 
4. Safety Belt Use: Safety belts are highly effective in preventing occupants from complete 
ejection.  According to 2003 crash data, 74 percent of passenger vehicle occupants who were 
completely ejected from the vehicle were killed.60  The data show that virtually all completely 
ejected occupants were unbelted.  Among completely ejected occupants, only one (1) percent of 
the occupants were reported to have been using safety belts.  For the analysis, we assumed that 
the safety belt use rate remains unchanged.  We expect that impacts of this assumption on the 
benefit estimate would not be significant since the belt use rate was relatively high when the fatal 
crash data were collected (82% in 2005) and the number of adjusted fatalities (1,392) was 
relatively small.  Even if the belt use rate increases two or three percentage points in the future

(MY 2011), the number of additional lives saved by the increase in belt use would be a small 
percentage of the overall benefits.61  
  
5. Occupants in Near and Far Side Seating Positions in Side Impacts:  In a study titled “The 
Effect of Side Air Bags on Fatalities and Ejection in Side Impact,” Kahane found that having an 
air bag for the torso and head reduced the fatality risk in all side impacts, except far side impacts 
to belted occupants, by about 20 percent for drivers and right-front passengers.  In particular, the 
report indicates that curtain air bags are equally effective in preventing partial and complete 
ejections for both near- and far-side occupants, excluding belted far-side occupants.  Although 
the agency does not have real world crash data for occupants in different seating positions, based 
on the performance of side air bags in real world crashes, rollover curtain air bags would provide 
a similar level of protections for occupants in both near-side and far-side seating positions in side 
impacts.  For the analysis, therefore, we assumed that rollover curtain air bags are equally 
                                                          
61 In a report titled “Fatality reduction by Safety Belts for Front-Seat Occupants of Cars and Light Trucks,” DOT HS 
809 199, Kahane found that 3-point belts are 74% and 80% effective in reducing fatalities for occupants in cars and 
light trucks, respectively, in rollovers (primary).  When the target population was separated by vehicle type, it 
showed that 41% of the side window ejection fatalities were from occupants in passenger cars and the remaining 
59% were from light trucks (see Appendix G).  Therefore, safety belts are about 78% effective in preventing side 
window ejection fatalities in rollovers.  If we assume that the belt use rate increases from 82% in 2005 to 85% in 
2010 we can calculate the change in benefits as follows.  Potential Fatality = (Current fatalities)/(1-
UPFCxEffectiveness); where UPFC = the belt use rate among fatalities in potential fatal crashes.  Assume UPFC = 
68% with the 82% use rate and 71% with the 85% use rate.  With the 1,392 observed fatalities, the potential 
fatalities would be 2,927 with 68% UPFC and 78% effectiveness.  Thus, safety belts with 82% use rate would save 
1,535 lives.  With the 85% use rate and 71% UPFC, safety belts would save 1,618 lives.  Therefore, lives saved by 
the higher belt use rate would be 83 (lives).  When the 83 lives are subtracted from the target population, it results in 
1,309 fatalities.  In the benefits chapter, we estimated that 402 lives out of 1,392 fatalities would be saved by the 
ejection mitigation system.  Thus, the overall effectiveness would 29% (402/1,392 =.29, 29%).  When the 29% 
overall effectiveness is applied to the 1,309 fatalities, it results in 378 lives saved.  Therefore, impacts of the higher 
use rate on the benefit estimate would be about 24 lives (6% reduction in the estimated benefits).  The model used 
for the UPFC: UPFC = 0.43751 x (average use rate) + 0.47249 x (average use rate)2].   “The basis for the use of a 
curvilinear model is the probability that the least risk-averse drivers are both more likely to get involved in fatal 
crashes and are less likely to use their seat belts.  This is reflected in the relatively low belt use rates among drivers 
involved in potentially fatal crashes.  As usage approaches 100%, those involved in fatal crashes will make up a 
greater portion of non-users, and an increasing portion of new users as well.  A complete discussion of the basis for 
selecting a curvilinear model is included on pages 9-11 of the source document.”  We seek comment on this 
approach.  For additional information, see “Belt Use Regression Model – 2003 Update,” by J. Wang and L. Blincoe,

effective in preventing both near- and far-side occupants from ejection in side impacts including 
side impacts followed by a rollover, excluding belted far-side occupants. 
      
Summary of Target Population:  The target population was initially categorized into two groups: 
(1) complete and partial ejections in rollovers not preceded by a side impact and (2) ejections in 
side impacts with and without subsequent rollovers.  The ejections in side impacts were further 
categorized into four subgroups: (a) followed by rollovers all but 12-25 mph, (b) followed by 
rollovers in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph, (c) adults in side impacts without any subsequent 
rollover in a 12-25 mph vehicle delta-V range, and (d) children in side impacts without any 
subsequent rollovers in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 mph. 
         
For the complete and partial ejections in rollovers not preceded by side impacts, the ESC 
adjusted target population show that 218 partial and 531 complete fatal ejections would occur, 
annually.62  Among these fatalities, 123 would be from belted occupants and the remaining 626 
would be from unbelted occupants.  For MAIS 3-5 injuries, we estimated that 311 and 449 
serious injuries would occur from partial and complete ejections, respectively, in rollover 
crashes.  Among these injuries, 249 would be from belted and the other 510 would be from 
unbelted occupants.  The injury data (MAIS 3-5) show that unrestrained occupants are more 
vulnerable than belted occupants: about 67% would be from unbelted and the remaining 33% 
would be from belted occupants.  The fatality data showed the same tendency, 15% from belted 
and 85% from unbelted.    
 
                                                          
62 As discussed in the benefit derivation section, we estimated the number of fatal and serious injuries resulting from 
very severe rollover crashes.  We assumed that the hypothetical ejection mitigation system would not be effective in 
preventing these injuries.  Accordingly, these fatal and serious injuries were excluded from the benefit analysis.   
     IV- 20 
In addition, the crash data show that about 88% (3,735) of the serious injuries occurred when 
occupants were ejected through the first row window opening, whereas 84% (3,671) of the 
fatalities were from ejections through the first row window opening.  The injury data show that a 
total of 4,249 serious injuries occurred when occupants were ejected through side window 
openings.  Among these serious injuries on average 63%, 26% and 11% were MAIS 3, MAIS 4 
and MAIS 5, respectively, as shown below63:

     IV- 21 
Benefits Derivation: 
The assumptions and methods used for the benefit estimate are presented in the following 
section.  
 
A. Assumptions 
 For the benefit analysis, the following assumptions were made: 
 Rollover sensors are capable of detecting any lateral rollovers that result in more than one 
quarter-turn. 
 Vehicles that have rollover sensors also have separate side impact sensors and are 
equipped with ESC.   
 Side impact sensors are effective in detecting impacts in a lateral vehicle delta-V range of 
12 mph and higher. 
 Rollover air bags are not effective in preventing occupants from either complete or partial 
ejections in the window opening area that failed to meet the 100 mm headform 
displacement requirement.64 
 We assumed that all ejections would be contained by the hypothetical ejection mitigation 
curtain air bag system if the system meets the headform displacement requirement.65   
 Side head air bags (that are designed to meet the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole 
requirements) are not effective in preventing occupants from complete ejection in side 
crashes. 
                                                          
64 The assumption implies that a particular ejection mitigation system is not effective when it fails to meet the 
proposed 100 mm displacement requirement.  However, a bag that fails to meet the proposed displacement 
requirement could protect some occupants in certain crashes.  Therefore, the assumption would underestimate the 
potential benefits.  
65 Although the performance of a curtain air bag is measured by the headform displacement, the analysis considered  
all partial and complete ejections through the window opening whether ejections are head-leading or not. 
     IV- 22 
 When ejection is eliminated, vehicle occupants who were originally ejected through the 
window opening areas would be exposed to the same risk of fatal and serious injuries as 
those occupants who were not ejected in similar crashes. 
 The seat belt use rate remains unchanged; same as the rate observed in the baseline 
calendar year.  
 Rollover air bags are assumed to be equally effective in preventing occupants from 
ejection in side crashes, whether they are in near-side, mid or far-side seating positions.66  
 Risk of ejection through the window opening area: 
o The risk of ejection through a particular area in the window opening is 
proportional to the likelihood of impacts with areas surrounding the window 
opening in rollovers.67 Alternatively, 
o The risk of ejection through a particular area in the window opening is identical 
regardless of the location.68  
 
The assumptions used for the analysis and justifications for the assumptions are further discussed 
in the following method section. 
 
B. Method 
For the benefit analysis, the basic estimation procedure consists of four steps: B.1 group fatal and 
serious injuries (MAIS 3-5) by crash type (rollover or side impacts), ejection type (partial or 
                                                          
66 For additional information, see a report titled “The Effect of Side Air Bags on Fatalities and Ejection in Side 
Impacts ” by Charles Kahane   
67 The assumption is based on dummy ejections in rollover tests.  However, we do not know how ejections are 
distributed in the opening area when such ejections occur in real world rollover crashes.  We note that in the 
sensitivity chapter in this PRIA.   
68 Under this assumption, when the window opening area is divided into four quadrants, the risk of ejection through 
each quadrant would be same. 
     IV- 23 
complete) and belt use; B.2 calculate performance of the ejection mitigation air bag system; B.3 
calculate overall percentage reduction rates; and B.4 derive benefits.  The following is a detailed 
description of these steps. 
 
B.1 Group Fatal and Serious Injuries:  The fatal and serious injuries in the target population were 
categorized by crash mode, ejection type and belt use.  We considered four different crash types 
in the analysis: rollovers without side impacts, side impacts followed by rollovers excluding 12-
25 mph delta-V’s, side impacts with subsequent rollovers in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 
mph, and finally, side impacts without subsequent rollovers in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 
mph.  In addition, four occupant ejection types (belted partial, belted complete, unbelted partial 
and unbelted complete) and children (0-12 years) were considered for the analysis. 
     
B.2 Calculate Performance of Ejection Mitigation System:  We assumed that the performance of 
an ejection mitigation system is directly related to the following three factors: sensor 
effectiveness, air bag containment effectiveness, and reduction in injury risk when an occupant 
remains inside a vehicle in crashes.69   
 
B.2.1. Sensor Effectiveness: 
Although the agency is not proposing any requirements for the sensor, as discussed below, we 
assumed that a rollover sensor will be provided as an integral part of the system and have 
accounted for its cost in our cost/benefits analysis.  To date, none of the field data examined 
                                                          
69 Rollover crashes are complex events and, as a result, many different factors would affect the outcomes.  Some of 
the factors are related to the vehicle (such as sensors, type of ejection mitigation systems, occupant protection in 
interior impacts, and structural integrity) and others are related to an occupant (such as belt use, seating position, 
size of the occupants).  For the vehicle related factors, sensors, containment systems and occupant protection in 
interior impacts/contacts would be most critical to the outcomes.   
     IV- 24 
(SCI, EWR and NASS) indicate that a problem exists with the deployment of air bag curtains in 
rollover crashes.70  In combination with this fact, as indicated above, the agency has not done 
any independent research on the characteristics of rollover sensors and at this point, is not able to 
set performance thresholds that optimize performance of a sensor in the field.  The fact that there 
is no apparent safety problem with respect to rollover sensors leads us to believe that it is 
reasonable to assume that vehicles with ejection mitigation curtain air bags would be equipped 
with a rollover sensor.  In other words, all manufacturers will provide rollover sensors, even 
though there will be no regulatory requirement to do so.  On the other hand, one might argue that 
the field data that we have seen to date is much too limited to conclude that sensors are 
performing adequately and no improvements are needed.71    
 
Although agency’s limited Special Crash Investigation (SCI) data and reports from industry 
indicate that current rollover sensors are performing well even in low severity rolls, we do not 
have statistically significant real world or laboratory data to determine how effective the sensors 
are in very low severity rolls.  For the analysis, therefore, we assumed that rollover sensors are 
                                                          
70 The agency’s SCI division conducted a detailed analysis of seven real-world rollover crashes on Ford vehicles 
where the subject vehicles contained a rollover sensor and curtain air bags, as shown below:

In each case, the rollover sensor deployed the side curtain air bag.  Note that the CA01-059 and CA04-010 cases 
show that current rollover sensors are capable of detecting quarter-turn rolls.    
71 Between October of 2005 and February of 2006 the agency met with four major supplier of rollover sensors 
(Autoliv, Delphi, Siemens, and TRW) and representatives of the Automotive Occupant Restraints Council (AORC).  
(Docket NHTSA-2006-26467.)  One of the inputs provided by the suppliers was that future ejection mitigation 
systems will be integrated in the vehicle electronic stability control (ESC), which will provide many other sensor 
inputs such as yaw, pitch, steering angle, wheel speed, longitudinal velocity and lateral velocity.  With these 
additional inputs, the system will be more robust, reducing the chance of unnecessary deployment and allowing for 
earlier deployment in rollovers.

not effective in low-energy (slow) rolls, which result in a single quarter turn.  (Since some 
sensors would be effective in low-energy rolls, the assumption would underestimate the potential 
benefits by underestimating sensor effectiveness.)  In addition, Knapton observed that the 
dominant factors determining vehicle impact velocities in rollovers appears to be those retarding 
the vehicle motion, and not those resulting from the vehicle motion.72  In other words, some 
quarter-turn rolls may have a high initial roll rate when the roll motion is interrupted by an 
external object at its quarter-turn.  Therefore, the assumption would further underestimate the 
effectiveness by excluding high energy (i.e., high initial roll rate) quarter-turn rolls.  For 
example, in a report titled “An Invetigation of Occupant Injury in Rollover: NASS-CDS 
Analysis of Injury Severity and Source By rollover Attributes,” Paul Bedewi found that about 
23% of all fatal injuries were from one-quarter rollover crashes.  As defined in this analysis, 
these rolls were considered as “slow” rolls.  Under the assumption, the sensor is not capable of 
detecting these “slow” rolls.  However, we suspect that the majority of fatal one-quarter rolls 
may have a high initial roll rate, such that the sensor could detect the roll.  Unfortunately, the 
agency does not have data to quantify the percent of fatal one-quarter rolls that had a high initial 
roll rate.73  P. Bedewi found that about 80% of all rolls are 2+ quarter turns (i.e., including 2 
quarter turns) in real world rollover crashes.  The data show that about 77% of all MAIS 6 in 
rollover crashes were from 2+ quarter turns.74  Accordingly, for fatal injuries, we assumed that 
                                                          
72 A report titles “Rollover Crash Test Film Analysis,” Report No. DOT-TSC-HS476-PM-83-25, July 1983. 
73 We note that not all fatal “slow” rolls as defined in the analysis have a slow initial roll rate.  In fact, we believe 
that the majority of these fatal “slow” rolls had a high initial roll rate.  However, as we discussed, we do not have 
information on the number of occupants who were fatally injuries in quarter-turn rolls with a high initial roll rate.

rollover sensors are 77% effective in detecting rolls in fatal rollover crashes.  For serious 
injuries, similar to the method used for fatal injuries, we estimated rollover sensors are 84% 
effective in detecting rolls, which result in serious injuries.75    
     
For side impacts, as discussed in the FMVSS No. 214 final rule, we assumed that side impact 
sensors are effective in any side crashes that have delta-V’s equal to or higher than 12 mph.76  
The side impact target population was categorized into three subgroups: (1) side impacts 
followed by rollover all but 19-40 km/h (12-25 mph) vehicle delta-V’s, (2) side impacts followed 
by rollover with 12-25 mph, and (3) side impacts without any rollover in a lateral delta-V range 
of 12-25 mph.   
 
Since both side impact and rollover sensors are capable of deploying the air bag, we established 
a hierarchy of the sensors for the three sub groups.  For the first side impact case above, as 
discussed in the FMVSS No.214 final rule, side impact sensors would not detect side impacts 
when the impacts occur at vehicle delta-V’s lower than 12 mph.  In other words, when a vehicle

75  According to the un-weighted MAIS injury distribution above, there were 738 MAIS 3-5 injuries (highlighted in 
the table).  Among these injuries, 618 were from 2+ ¼ turns: (368+250)/(120+368+250) = 84%.  We note that 
suppliers estimate their rollover sensors will work between 90% and 95% of rollovers.  If the claim is indeed true, 
the assumption would underestimate the sensor effectiveness by 7% - 12% for non-fatal serious injuries and 14% - 
19% for fatal injuries.  Note that in the sensitivity chapter in this PRIA, we estimated the potential benefits with both 
90% and 95% sensor effectiveness. 
76 Although side sensors would be effective in this delta-V’s (12+ mph), we estimated that the countermeasures 
and/or vehicle structure would not be effective in delta-V’s higher than 25 mph in side crashes.   
     IV- 27 
rolls more than one-quarter turn after a side impact, which occurs at a vehicle lateral delta-V of 
12 mph or lower, its rollover sensor would deploy the air bags.77  As for side impacts followed 
by rollover at delta-V’s higher than 25 mph, the crashes were not coded by impact objects.  
Therefore, we did not know whether these crashes are vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-narrow 
object or other roadside objects.  We suspect that the majority of these objects were relatively 
close to the ground since these objects most likely tripped the vehicle into rollover.  Therefore, 
for delta-V’s higher than 25 mph in both single and multiple vehicle side impacts with 
subsequent rollover, we assumed that vehicle’s rollover sensor, not side impact sensors, deploys 
the air bag.78  For the second and third side impact cases mentioned above, we assumed that side 
impact sensors detect impacts and trigger the deployment in a vehicle delta-V range of             
12-25 mph, as assumed in the FMVSS No. 214-side impact analysis, whether subsequent rolls 
occur or not.        
   
B.2.2. Containment Effectiveness: 
As briefly discussed in the assumption section, we do not know how ejections are distributed in 
the window opening area when such ejections occur in real world rollover crashes.  For the 
containment effectiveness, two different approaches were initially considered.  One is based on 
kinetic energy that the air bag can absorb in its deployment (i.e. inflation stage), and the other is 
                                                          
77 Previously, we estimated that rollover sensors are about 77% effective in fatal crashes, whereas side impact 
sensors are 100% effective in 12+ mph lateral delta-V crashes.  The 77% roll sensor estimate was made based on an 
assumption that rollover sensors are not capable of detecting one-quarter rolls.      
78 In the 214-benefit analysis, we assumed that side impact sensors are capable of detecting all side impacts (as 
defined in the 214-benfit analysis) at a vehicle lateral delta-V of 12 mph and higher.  We do not have crash data to 
determine whether vehicle’s side impact or rollover sensors trigger the bag.  When a vehicle rolls after a high lateral 
impact, most of these rolls would result in multiple ¼-turns due to high kinetic energy associated with the lateral 
impacts speed.  However, not all these rolls would result in multiple ¼-turns.  As assumed, vehicle’s rollover sensor 
is not capable of detecting these single quarter turn rolls.  Consequently, by assuming its rollover sensor triggers the 
bag at these delta-V’s, we would underestimate the potential ejection mitigation benefits.     
     IV- 28 
based on the likelihood of occupant ejection through a particular area of the window opening in a 
rollover, as discussed below:   
 
B.2.2.1 Effectiveness based on kinetic energy: For this approach, we examined dummy ejection 
velocities in rollovers with respect to the number of rolls.  It may be intuitive that the number of 
rolls can be seen as a measure of rollover crash severity.  Accordingly, one would expect an 
increase in dummy (to vehicle) impact velocity as the number of rolls increases.  If we assume 
that the ejection velocity increases as the number of roll increases, the air bag becomes 
ineffective when the number of rolls reaches a certain threshold.  In other words, since the air 
bag would be designed to withstand a finite kinetic energy level, under the assumption, as the 
number of rolls increases, the kinetic energy associated with the dummy would become greater 
than the air bag can withstand (i.e., reaches the threshold).  To validate the conjecture that the 
energy level is proportional to the number of rolls, we examined how test dummies behave 
during roll.  In a report titled “Rollover Crash Test Film Analysis,” D. Knapton studied test films 
obtained from the Federal Highway Administration to determine dummy & vehicle motion 
during vehicle rollover.  Contrary to the expectation, Knapton reports in his film analysis that 
there was a trend toward lower dummy impact velocities as the number of rolls increased, as 
shown below: 
Table IV-20

(2) Maximum of all the maximum velocities at specified number of rolls (ft/sec) 
     IV- 29 
 
According to Knapton, the dominant factor determining dummy/vehicles impact velocities in the 
6 tests examined appears to be those retarding the vehicle motion, and not those resulting from 
the vehicle motion.  He found that the vertical motion of a rolling vehicle appeared to be a 
significant factor in reducing the amount of vehicle rolling (i.e., the number of rolls).  This 
dummy test data did not show a direct relationship between interior impact and ejection velocity 
and the number of rolls.  We concluded that insufficient data exist to derive a relationship 
between the number of rolls and occupant-to-interior impact velocity.  Therefore, we are unable 
to use an energy method/approach that relies on this relationship to determine the containment 
effectiveness.   
 
B.2.2.2 Effectiveness based on risk of ejection: Alternatively, we examined the risk of ejection 
through a particular area in the window opening in rollover crashes to determine the containment 
effectiveness.  Two assumptions for the risk ejection were examined and used for the benefit 
analysis.  One is to assume that the risk of ejections through a particular opening area in the 
window opening is proportional to the likelihood of impacts around the opening area in rollover 
crashes (i.e., weighted risk of ejection).  The other is to assume that the risk of ejections through 
the opening is evenly distributed in the window opening area (i.e., uniform risk of ejection). 
These two methods are discussed below: 
 
B.2.2.2.1 Weighted risk of ejection: Although vehicle rolls are complex events and neither a 
translation nor a rotation about a fixed axis, one could reason that there is a higher impact 
frequency of the head at areas above the window opening compared to areas below the opening 
     IV- 30 
since the axis of rotation is often below the CG of an occupant and the distance between the head 
and the header (upper portion of the window opening) is shorter than the distance between the 
head and the window sill.79  In the report, D. Knapton reports a total of 10 impacts above and 
below the window opening area during the rolls: three (3) at window header, four (4) upper door 
frame, and three (3) at window sill: 7 were above the opening and the remaining 3 were below 
the window opening area.  A similar impact tendency was observed in real world rollover 
crashes.  According to Digges, a NASS sample count shows that there were 10 brain/neck 
injuries (nine brain injuries and one spine injury) that occurred as a result of impacts with 
vehicle’s rail/header (above the window opening) and 7 brain injuries resulting from impacts 
with upper side interior (below the opening, such as window sill) for belted occupants in 
rollovers.80   It appears that the real world rollover crash and laboratory test data support the 
conjecture that there is a higher impact frequency at areas above the window opening compared 
to areas below the opening.  Furthermore, a series of rollover tests performed by GM suggest that 
there is a higher risk of ejection through the upper portion of the window opening area when 
compared to the lower portion of the opening. 81   For the analysis, therefore, we assumed that 
                                                          
79 Real world crash data show that the majority of rollovers are considered as “tripped” rollovers.  In tripped 
rollovers, a vehicle moves laterally until it reaches a tipping point and rolls.  Initially, the vehicles would rotate 
about an axis formed by two contact points between the wheels and the ground.  Occupants in the near-side outboard 
seating positions initially move laterally toward the window opening area as the vehicle rotates.  As a result, the 
head of the occupant often impacts with the upper portion of the window opening area.  During subsequent rolls, 
forces generated during the rolls often keep the initially displaced occupant in a particular location in the vehicle, 
such as vehicle’s window headliner. 
80 According to K. Digges, “Summary Report of Rollover Crashes,” June 2002, FHWA/NHTSA National Analysis 
Center, NASS sample counts of head impacts with rail/header (upper portion of the window opening area, a total of 
10) are about 40% higher than head impacts with upper side components (lower portion of the window opening area, 
a total of 7) for belted occupants in rollover crashes.     
81 In a briefing, “Ejection Mitigation Component Test Development,” GM reports peak resultant membrane corner 
load measurements made by a load cell installed at each window opening corner.  The data indicate that the number 
of impacts at the upper front portion of the window opening is greater than the number of impacts at the lower front 
portion of the window opening in the tests.  However, the peak resultant force data indicate that the impacts are 
more evenly distributed when impacts at the front and rear portions of the window opening area are compared.  
According to their test data, 43% of the maximum resultant membrane attachment loads occurred at the upper rear 
corner and 33% occurred at the lower rear corner (see Figure 30 in the report).  The upper front and lower front had 
     IV- 31 
the risk of ejections through a particular area in the window opening is proportional to the 
likelihood of impacts around the opening area in rollover crashes.  In other words, the risk of 
ejection through the upper portion of the window opening would be higher than the risk of 
ejection through lower portion of the opening, when such ejections occur.      
 
While the majority of vehicle occupants would be contained by rollover air bags, the current 
design indicate that some occupants could be ejected through potential gaps around the bottom 
and front lower portion of the air bag. 82  To determine the effectiveness, we derived a likelihood 
of ejections through a particular area in the window opening for a typical curtain air bag, which 
is anchored at A- and C-pillars and attached to the window header, as illustrated in Figure IV-
2.83  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
15% and 9%, respectively.  (O’Brian-Mitchell, Bridget M., Lange, Robert C., “Ejection Mitigation in Rollover 
Events – Component Test Development,” SAE 2007-01-0374.) 
82 The real world crash data and very limited laboratory test data may suggest that the risk of ejection through the 
upper portion of the window opening would be higher than the risk of ejection through lower portion of the opening. 
Therefore, if we assume that ejections are evenly distributed in the window opening area, it would overestimate the 
risk of ejection through the potential gaps around the bottom and front lower portion of the bag.  Mathematically, 
therefore, the containment effectiveness derived based on the “even distribution” assumption could be considered as 
a minimum effectiveness.  We note that occupants could move around inside a vehicle during a rollover event.  
Therefore, some occupants could have multiple impacts with the air bag, especially in severe complex rollovers.  In 
some cases, an occupant could move to the potential opening after the occupant initially impacts the curtain area 
without the potential opening.   However, we do not have a direct knowledge of these movements in rollovers and, 
consequently, the influence of these movements were not included in the analysis.       
83 As discussed later in this section, occupants who are initially contained by air bags could find another ejection 
portal when a sufficient roll time is given.  Thus, the risk of ejection would increases when the number of rolls 
increases.  However, we do not know the exact effect of the number of rolls or the duration of crashes on occupant 
movement.  Due to limited data the effect was not considered in the analysis.

Risk of ejection through window opening: 
Knapton reports that dummy motion during a rollover sequence normally starts with an initial 
movement caused by an initial impact with an exterior object and that in most rollovers 
involving window ejections the head of a dummy leads the ejection.  One of observations he 
made was that the test dummies impacted multiple times with vehicle’s interior components 
during a roll sequence whether restrained or not. 84, 85  The review of the motion pictures taken 
inside seven vehicles during rollover crashes are summarized below:86

85 The dummy impact sequence data show that most of the dummies initially impacted vehicle interior components 
(seven (7) out of the nine (9) rollover tests) rather than the window opening area.  The data show that some of 
window ejections occurred after the dummy impacts with vehicle interior (surface) components such as window sill 
or A-pillar.

When using the areas above and below the window as proxies, the belted dummy data showed 
that the likelihood of impacting the upper portion of the window opening area (67%) is greater 
than the likelihood of impacting lower portion of the window opening area (33%).   
 
As discussed previously, some occupants would be ejected through potential gaps around the 
bottom and front lower portions of the air bag, even if the air bag is in compliance with the 
proposed linear headform displacement requirement.87  To determine the size and location of the 
potential gaps, we examined the overall dimension of the headform and its relative positions with 
respect to the window frame.  The headform has a height of approximately 10 inches (250 mm) 
and a width of about 6 inches (150 mm).  The CG of the headform is about the geometric center 
of the head: approximately 5 inches from the bottom surface of the headform.  When positioned 
at the impact points, A1 and A2 in the front window opening, the CG of the headform would be 
                                                          
87 Based on the headform impact points with respect to the window frame, we believe that most of ejections through 
the gap would be partial ejections and that these ejections may or may not result in serious injuries.  However, under 
the methodology, by limiting the target population to serious injuries, we are assuming that any ejections through 
these potential gaps would result in serious injuries.    
     IV- 34 
approximately 6 inches from the window sill, as shown below: 
   
Figure IV-3. Position of Impactor (headform) with respect to Window Sill 
When the head of an occupant impacts with these impact points, A1 and A2, hypothetically, the 
air bag would contain the head and, as a result, prevent the occupant from ejection.  However, 
for areas below these impact points, toward the window sill, the air bag may or may not contain 
the occupant when such impacts/ejections occur in rollover crashes since the linear headform test 
cannot be performed in this narrow area.  Accordingly, we assumed that rollover bags are not 
effective in preventing ejection if the CG of the head of an occupant is lower than the CG of the 
headform measured at the two lower impact points, A1 and A2 in the linear headform test.88   
 
For example, the window opening of a 2003 model year Toyota Camry has a height of about 18 
inches.  When the headform is positioned at A1 or A2, the distance between the CG of the 
headform and the window sill would be about six (6) inches (as shown in Figure IV-3).  If the 
                                                          
88 The assumption implies that all occupant impacts below the 6-inch line would result in partial or complete 
ejections.  However, we suspect that not all occupant impacts at these areas would result in partial or complete 
ejections since the lower portion of the bag would interfere with the movement in some ejections.  Thus, an ejection 
under this assumption could be considered a “worst case scenario”.

window area is divided into three equal lengths vertically, the lower 1/3 portion of the window 
opening would be below the CG of the headform.  The window opening of the Camry has a 
height of 46 cm (18 inches) and a width of 99 cm (39 inches) at the top and 191 cm (75 inches) 
at the bottom (at the window sill).  Thus, the lower 1/3 window opening area would be 2,675 
cm2, which is 40% of the total window area.89  Since there are many different shapes of the 
window opening, for simplicity, we assumed a rectangle for all side window openings in the 
analysis.  Under the assumption, about 33% (6”/18” = 33%, 1/3) of the window opening area 
would be below the CG of the headform (i.e., the difference between the CG of the headform and 
the window sill).  Under the assumption, the bottom 1/3 of the window opening would be 
considered as a potential gap that the head of an occupant can get through90 in rollover crashes, 
even if rollover air bags meet the headform displacement requirement at the two lower impact 
points.   
 
Previously, for belted occupants, we estimated that the likelihood of impacting areas above the 
window opening is 67% and the likelihood of impacting areas below the opening is 33%.  As 
discussed in the assumption section, 67% of belted occupants who were either partially or 
completely ejected through the window opening would be ejected through the upper portion of 
the window opening and the remaining 33% would be through the lower portion.  In other words, 
the risk of ejection through the upper portion of the window area would be 2 times higher than 
the risk of ejection through the lower portion of the opening (67%/33% = 2 times).   
                                                          
89 Total area = 6,619 cm2; upper 2/3 area = (1/2)(99+x)(2/3)(46) cm2; lower 1/3 area = (1/2)(x+191)(1/3)(46) cm2. 
90 As discussed in this chapter, when the head-form has a displacement of 100 mm at the lower impact points, 
theoretically, it could result in a 182 mm gap between the window sill and the bottom of the bag (see Figure IV-4), 
assuming the bag is just long/tall enough to retain the headform.  If the curtain were rigid structure, hypothetically, 
any body parts that are larger than the 182 mm gap would not go through the gap.  However, when the head hits the 
182 mm gap, the curtain can be pushed upward creating a wider gap.  However, we do not know whether the gap is 
wide enough (wider than 182 mm) to allow a head or other body parts to get through.

The derivation above shows that if air bags are not effective in preventing ejection through the 
lower 1/3 of the opening, the containment effectiveness (not overall effectiveness) would be at 
least 67% for belted occupants91 in certain rollover crashes.92  (We note that occupants who were 
initially contained by the bag might find an ejection portal when a sufficient roll time is given.  
However, agency’s 208-dolly test results indicate that many adult occupants would get stuck in 
one section of the car with inflated curtain air bags (most often up against the B-pillar) and 
would not transverse from one side of the vehicle to another each time the vehicle rolls.93  The 
test results lead us to believe that the majority of adult belted occupants who are initially 
contained by inflated rollover bags would not find another portal in severe rolls.  However, we 
note that almost all of the dolly tests had belted test dummies and would not show how unbelted 
occupants behave in rolls.  We suspect that unbelted occupants would have a higher degree of 
movement along an area of contact in the air bag.  As of today, we do not know how the number 
and duration of rolls affect the bag’s containment capability in real world crashes.  Accordingly, 
these effects were not considered in the analysis.94  Note that, as discussed in the target 
                                                          
91 In other words, if the ejections were evenly distributed in the opening, the hypothetical rollover curtain bag would 
prevent 67% of the ejections.  However, since the risk of ejection through the upper portion of the window opening 
would be higher than the risk of ejection through the lower portion of the opening, the containment effectiveness 
would be higher than 67%. 
92 The 6 inch potential gap would be large enough to allow upper extremities (hands, arms and shoulders) to contact 
exterior objects in rolls.  For belted occupants, we speculate that the majority of upper extremity injuries would 
occur when these body parts are ejected through areas near the window sill.  In a report titled “An Investigation of 
Occupant Injury In Rollover: NASS-CDS Analysis of Injury Severity and Sources by Rollover Attibutes,” ESV 
Paper No. 419, Paul G. Bedewi, found that upper extremities account for 14% of AIS 3+ injuries for belted 
occupants.  The upper extremity ejection through the potential gap is further referenced in the discussion section in 
this chapter.         
93 In a study titled “Timing of Head to vehicle Perimeter Contacts in Rollovers” (SAE 2007-01-0370), the motion of 
the occupants prior to an upper vehicle structure-to-ground impact in rollovers was analyzed. One of the conclusions 
made by the study is that occupants approach the roof rail area and remain there.  It said “Restrained occupants very 
quickly approached the roof rail and remained there until there were additional external forces due to vehicle-to-
ground impacts.”  In addition, it found that the trajectories of near-side occupants were similar for both restrained 
and unrestrained occupants.  The authors also noted that unrestraint occupant motion was more variable and chaotic, 
particularly for far side occupants.      
94  The film analysis shows that the dummies, whether restrained or not, impacted multiple times with vehicle’s 
interior components during a roll sequence, when vehicles are not equipped with air bags.  In some cases, the 
dummy was propelled several times in different directions and partially ejected more than once during a vehicle roll.  
     IV- 37 
population section (see Table IV-3), we limited our target population to planar-only side crashes 
and lateral rollovers (i.e., vehicle rolls about its longitudinal axis).   
     
In summary, although we do not have real world crash data to show occupant ejection paths in 
the window opening area in rollover crashes, we have anecdotal test data that suggest (i) that the 
number of ejections through the upper portion of the window opening may be greater than the 
number of ejections through the lower portion and (ii) that rollover air bags might not be 
effective in preventing the head or arms of an occupant from ejection through a potential gap 
between the curtain and the window sill, even if the air bags are in compliance with the 
displacement requirement.       
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
For example, the head of the unbelted driver dummy in the ’76 Honda ejected twice during a very severe eight (8) 
quarter-turn rollover.  If we assume that an unbelted occupant impacts twice the window opening area covered with 
a rollover curtain during an 8 quarter-turn rollover and that the bag is 71% effective in containing an occupant 
whenever the occupant impacts with the opening area.  Hypothetically, under the assumptions, the system would 
have an overall containment effective of 50% (71%x71% = 50%).

The results in the tables above show that 33% of the ejections would occur through the lower 
portion of the window (i.e., lower 50% of the window opening).  If bags are not effective in 
preventing ejection through the potential gap (between the curtain and the window sill), we 
estimated that 22% of the ejections would occur through the potential gap in the lower portion of 
the window opening. [For simplicity of calculation, we assumed that ejections are evenly 
distributed in the lower portion of the opening.  Under the assumption, 22% (21.8%) of the 
ejections would occur through lower 1/3 (33%) of the opening, 33%* (.33/.50) = 22%.]  
Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the risk of ejection through the upper 2/3 of the 
uncovered window opening area would be at least 78% (100%-22% = 78%).  In other words, 
even if a rollover curtain air bag meets the requirements 22% of the ejections would occur 
through the potential gap between the curtain and the window sill.   For the analysis, therefore, 
we assume that the containment effectiveness for a curtain air bag meeting the proposed 
     IV- 40 
requirements would be 78% for belted occupants in rollover crashes, if there were no other 
potential gaps in the opening. 95,96   
 
We note that the standard would use a guided impactor component test to assess the ability of the 
countermeasure (e.g., a curtain system) to mitigate ejections in different types of rollover and 
side impact crashes involving different occupant kinematics.  The test has been carefully 
designed to represent the dynamic rollover event.  Due to limited data, we assumed that any 
ejections resulting AIS 3+ injuries, including fatalities, would be represented by the headform 
test in the analysis.  In other words, we assumed that when a curtain air bag meets the proposed 
headform test requirements, it would prevent any ejections through the side window opening.97   
There are two rationales for the assumption.  First, the impact mass is based on the mass imposed 
by a 50th percentile male’s upper torso on the window opening during an occupant ejection.  The 
mass of the impactor, 18 kilograms (kg) (40 lbs), in combination with the impact speed discussed 
below, has sufficient kinetic energy to assure that the ejection mitigation countermeasure is able 
to protect a far-reaching population of people in real world crashes.  The component test involves 
                                                          
95 If the ejections were evenly distributed in the lower portion of the window, about 22% [(33%* (.33/.50) = 22%,] 
of the ejections would occur through the potential gap in the lower portion of the window opening.  As discussed, 
the risk of ejection would decrease as the impact point moves toward the window sill.  Therefore, it would be 
reasonable to assume that the risk of ejection through the lower portion would not be higher than 22%.  In other 
words, the risk of ejection through the upper 2/3 of the window opening area would be at least 78%% (100%-22% = 
78%).  Accordingly, we assumed that the containment system would be 78% effective in preventing occupant 
ejections through the window opening area.  Note that the assumption would underestimate the containment 
effectiveness since the ejection through the upper portion would be higher than 78%.  
96 With the estimated 78% containment effectiveness for belted occupants, rollover bags would allow 22% of 
ejections through a potential gap above the window sill.  We suspect that the majority of these ejections would be 
upper extremities.  As discussed, according to Paul G. Bedewi, 2003, ESV Paper No. 419, upper extremities account 
for 14% of AIS 3+ injuries for belted occupants in rollovers.  Previously, we estimated that when both belted and 
unbelted occupants are considered, about 20% of injuries would occur through the potential gap (when both belted 
and unbelted were considered, 30% through the lower portion, 30% x (.33/.50) = 20%).  The estimated 22% risk of 
ejection through the gap for belted occupants shows that unbelted occupant would have a higher risk of ejections 
through the upper portion of the window opening area (with less than 20% risk of ejection through the potential gap) 
when compared to belted occupants, when such ejections occur.      
97 As discussed in the target population section, there are some exceptions to this assumption.  For catastrophic 
rollovers crashes, we assumed that the ejection mitigation system would not be effective even if it meets the 
proposed headform requirements.  
     IV- 41 
use of a guided linear impactor designed to replicate the loading of a 50th percentile male 
occupant’s head and upper torso during ejection situations.  The mass of the guided impactor was 
developed through pendulum tests, side impact sled tests, and modeling conducted to determine 
the mass imposed on the window opening by a 50th percentile adult male’s upper torso and head 
during an occupant ejection (“effective mass”).98  The final part of the analysis involved 
computer modeling of an 18 kg impactor and 50th percentile Hybrid III dummy impacting 
simulated glazing (foam).  The comparison found that the total energy transferred by the 18 kg 
impactor was within the range of the total energy transferred by the entire dummy.  For a 16.1 
km/h dummy model impact with the foam, the effective mass that came in contact with the foam 
was between 12.5 kg and 27 kg.  Second, although we do know the number of ejections that are 
head-heading in real world rollovers, we believe that the majority of ejections in rollovers are 
either head-leading or shoulder-leading ejections.  According to the film analysis by Knapton, 
there were 52 dummy-to-vehicle interior impacts and 13 dummy ejections were observed.  
Among the 13 dummy ejections, 8 were head-leading, 4 were shoulder-leading and the 
remaining one was back-leading ejections.99                       
 
(2) Unbelted Occupants for Vertical Impact Distribution in Rollovers: 
When the unbelted dummy impact data were considered separately, there is only one case of 
dummy impacting the area surrounding the window opening, as shown previously.  Therefore, 
we determined that the number of dummy impacts were too small to derive an impact 
distribution with respect to the window opening area.  Therefore, for unbelted occupants who 
                                                          
98 For additional discussion see “Technical Analysis in Support of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Ejection 
Mitigation.”

were ejected through the side window opening, the dummy data were not utilized for the vertical 
impact distribution.  Instead, we analyzed real world crash data to qualitatively determine 
whether it is reasonable to use the belted occupant containment effectiveness rate as a proxy for 
unbelted occupants.  According to Digges, unrestrained occupants have a higher risk of 
contacting the upper portion of the window opening area (about 1.3 times) when compared to 
restrained occupants in real world rollover crashes, as shown below:100

Frequency101  
Rail/Headers 1.9% 2.5% 1.3 
 
In addition, the NASS data show that belted and unbelted occupants would have a similar 
frequency (risk) of impacts with vehicle’s interior side components, as shown below:   
 
Table IV-26

Impact Area Restrained Unrestrained

All interior impacts 521 838 
% of total  5.8% 6.0% 
   
The results in Table IV-26 show that 5.8% of interior impacts occurred with side interior 
components for restrained occupants and 6.0% for unrestrained occupants.  (Although the NASS 
sample count shows that belted and unbelted occupants would have a similar risk of striking 
interior side components, the dummy test data and real world injuries suggest that unbelted 
occupants would more freely bounce around in rollover crashes.  As a result, unbelted occupants 
would have a higher exposure of receiving serious injuries when compared to belted occupants in 
rollover crashes.)  The field data show that it would be reasonable to assume that both 
                                                          
100 These are injury inducing contacts as reported in real world crashes.  We do not know how non-injurious contacts 
are distributed in the area surrounding the opening in real world crashes.    
101 2.5%/1.9% = 1.3 
     IV- 43 
unrestrained and restrained occupants have the same risk of striking interior side components as 
they do of any other injurious impact and that unrestrained occupants have a 1.3 times higher 
chance of striking the upper portion of the window opening, when such impacts occur, as shown 
below:      
Table IV-27

Impact Area Restrained Unrestrained

Lower portion (below window) 33% 27% 
Total 100% 100% 
 
Table IV-27 shows that 73% and 27% of unbelted occupants would collide with the upper 
portion and the lower portion of the window opening area, respectively.  The analysis of real 
world data strongly suggested that unbelted occupants would have a higher risk of ejection 
through the upper portion of the window opening when compared to belted occupants.103  
Therefore, unbelted occupants would have a lower risk of ejection through the potential gap 
above the window sill, when such ejections occurred.  As a result, the bag would have a higher 
containment effectiveness rate for unbelted occupants when compared to belted occupants.  
However, we are uncertain that the real world crash data are statistically sufficient to quantify the 
estimated risk of ejection for unbelted occupants.  For unbelted occupants, therefore, we used the 
78% containment effectiveness rate that was derived for belted occupants as a proxy.  
(Consequently, the use of the containment effectiveness rate derived for belted occupants, as a 
proxy, for unbelted occupants would underestimate the potential benefits.)  In summary, the real 
                                                          
102 [(67/33)x1.3]/[(67/33)x(1.3) + 1] = 0.725, 73% 
103 The ejections include both partial and complete ejections in rollovers.  We suspect that lap and shoulder belts 
would reduce the vertical movement of an occupant in rollovers and, as a result, reduce the risk of ejection through 
the upper portion of window opening, when compared to unbelted occupants.  Note that belted occupants have a 
lower risk of complete ejection compared to unbelted occupants.  As discussed in a section titled “injury risk 
associated with remaining inside the vehicle section,” preventing belted occupants from ejection would result in a 
different overall system effectiveness value when compared to unbelted occupants.       
     IV- 44 
world crash data suggest that unbelted occupants would have a higher risk of ejection through 
the upper portion of the window opening and that assuming both belted and unbelted occupants 
would have the same risk of ejection through a particular area in the window opening would not 
over estimate the potential benefits.     
                        
Risk of ejection through area between curtain air bag and A-pillar:  
Previously, we estimated the risk of ejection with respect to the upper and lower areas of the 
window opening.  Since the impact points spread across the window opening area, we also 
examined the likelihood of ejection through a particular area in the window opening with respect 
to the front- and rear-portion of the opening (i.e., lateral distribution).   
 
Belted Occupants (lateral distribution): For belted test dummies, the impact data show that the 
majority of the impacts occurred at the B-pillar, as shown below: 
Table IV-28 
Belted Dummy Impacts with A- and B-Pillars 
  Test No. (Knapton)

A-pillar  0 1  0  0  0 1
B-pillar 2 1 1 1  0 5
 Total           6
  
The results in Table IV-28 show that the belted dummies had a total of six (6) impacts with the 
A- or B-pillars.  Among the six (6) impacts, five (5) were at the B-pillar and the remaining one 
(1) was at the A-pillar.  The results indicate that belted occupants would have a lower risk of 
hitting the front-portion of the window opening area when compared to the rear portion, as 
shown below:  
 
     IV- 45

However, the belted dummies used in the vehicle tests were restrained with lap belts, not 3-point 
lap & shoulder belts.  Since the shoulder belt would restrict the dummy movements toward the 
A-pillar compared to 2-point lap belts, we expect the number of impacts with the B-pillar would 
be higher if the 3-point belts were used in the test. 
 
Similar to the approach used for the vertical impact distribution in the window opening area, we 
assumed that the likelihood of impacting with the B-pillar (which is rearward of the window 
opening) and the A-pillar are 83% and 17%, respectively, for belted occupants when only the 
longitudinal distribution of the impacts was considered, as shown below: 
Table IV-31a 
Likelihood of Impacting Rear and Front of Window Opening 
Belted Occupants, Ejection through Front Window Opening 
    Impact Area % of Segment of Window Opening % of
Rear of window opening 83%  Rear of window opening 83%
Front of window opening 17%  Front of window opening 17%
 
Similar to the method used for the vertical impact distribution, we assumed that ejections are 
evenly distributed in the front half of the window opening.  Under the assumption, therefore, 
8.5% of the impacts would be in the front ¼ of the window opening area.104  Typically, a curtain 
bag is attached to the roof rail and anchored at the A- and C-pillars as the air bag is designed to 
deploy from the vehicle’s roof rail.  The rear end of most current air bags is attached to the lower 
                                                          
104 Being consistent with the method used for the risk of vertical ejection, we assumed that ejections were evenly 
distributed in the front ½ of the window opening area with respect to the A- and B-pillars.  If the ejections were 
evenly distributed in the front ½ of the window opening area, the risk of ejection through the front ¼ area would be 
8% (17%/2 = 8%).      
     IV- 46 
part of the C-pillar near the window sill (C-pillar anchor), whereas the front end is attached to the 
middle of the A-pillar (A-pillar anchor).  In this air bag configuration, the portion below the line 
drawn between the C-pillar and A-pillar anchors is not attached to the vehicle structure, although 
it covers the window opening area.  When the A-pillar attachment is too far from the window sill 
(i.e., near the roof rail), therefore, the front lower portion of the air bag (the portion that is below 
the line drawn between the A- and C-pillar anchors) would not meet the displacement 
requirement when tested with the headform. To provide a sufficient tension without excessive 
gas pressure in the air chambers, manufacturers would lower the A-pillar anchorage close to the 
window sill.  Likewise, to meet the proposed linear headform displacement requirement at the 
front lower point (A1), vehicle manufacturers would position the A-pillar anchor close to the CG 
of the headform positioned at A1 (i.e., close to the horizontal plane passing through the CG).105  
The CG of the headform positioned at A1 would be near the midpoint of the front window 
opening.106  Therefore, we believe that manufacturers would design the air bag system such that 
the front of the air bag is anchored at a point that is lower than the midpoint of the A-pillar.  In 
addition, the upper front part of the air bag would be securely attached to the pillar.  As a result, 
the upper front of the area between the air bag and the A-pillar would be completely covered 
and, hypothetically, would not create any gap in rollover crashes (that are considered in the 
benefit analysis).  Accordingly, for occupants who impact the front ¼ of the window opening 
area, we assumed that only the bottom ½ of the area (that is, the area between the bag and A-
pillar) would allow (partial) ejection,107 as shown in Figure IV-5.   
                                                          
105 If the A-pillar anchor is positioned above A1, it would be difficult to provide sufficient tension in the bag to 
withstand forces generated during the headform impact at the impact point (A1).   
106 The front window of a 2003 Toyota Camry has a height of 18 inches.  When the headform is position in the A1, 
the CG of the headform would be 6 inches from the window sill, below the midpoint of the front window opening.   
107 As shown in Figure IV-5, since the front corner would be too narrow to position the headform, manufacturers 
may or may not cover this area with loomed air bag cloth.  When the area is not covered with loomed air bag cloth, 
     IV- 47 
 
The majority of current single-piece curtain air bags are designed to continuously cover the front 
and rear window openings, as it is anchored at the A-and C-pillars.  Therefore, for occupants 
who strike the rear-portion of the front window opening area, we assumed that the curtain bag 
would prevent them from ejection in rollover crashes.108  Under the assumptions, approximately 
5% of belted occupants would be ejected through the front lower corner potential opening 
(between A-pillar and  the window sill) if the bag is not effective in preventing occupants from 
ejection through the lower 1/3 of the front ¼ of the window opening area.109  (The estimated 5% 
ejection rate is based on the risk of ejection, the anchor location, headform impact points and 
current curtain air bag designs.  However, we note that a typical passenger car has a very narrow 
opening area between window sill and the lower portion of the A-pillar, as illustrated in Figure 
IV-5.  Therefore, we suspect that the head of an adult occupant in a passenger car is too large to 
go through this narrow opening area.  As a result, it would underestimate the air bag containment 
since the majority of ejected occupants were adults.  On the other hand, upper extremities (such 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
partial ejections could occur in rollovers.  For the analysis, we assumed that this area is not covered with air bag 
cloth although it would slightly underestimate the containment effectiveness.   
108 As discussed in the target population section, we determined that not all fatal and non-fatal injuries would be 
prevented by curtain bags even if the bags initially prevent ejections through the window opening. 
109 Previously, when only vertical ejections are considered, we estimated that 22% of ejections would occur through 
the lower 1/3 portion of the window opening area (i.e., potential gap).  Whereas, when only lateral ejections are 
considered, we estimated that 8% of the ejections would occur through the front ¼ of the window opening area.  We 
assumed that the upper portion of the front window opening would be covered by a curtain bag that is securely 
attached to the A-pillar.  Therefore, assuming ejections are evenly distributed, the risk of ejection through the lower 
portion of the front window opening area would be 5% ((8%x22%)+(8%x77%)/2 = 5%).

as arms and shoulders) of an adult occupant and the head of a small child could be ejected 
through the gap.) 
 
We note that passenger cars and light trucks have many different shapes and sizes of the window 
opening.  Some are more slanted than others (especially passenger cars).  To simplify the 
calculation for air bag containment effectiveness, as shown in the calculation above, we assumed 
that window openings are rectangular in shape with a height of 46 cm (18 inches) and an opening 
area of 6,619 cm2 (1,026 in2) of the Camry.  One of the consequences of assuming “rectangle” 
for the window opening is that it reduces the potential gap (area) above the window sill since 
most window openings have a relatively larger area moving toward the window sill.  In the 
uniform risk distribution method section, following the weighted risk distribution section here, 
we assumed that the risk of ejection is evenly distributed regardless of belt use and shape of the 
window opening.  Potential benefits derived from these two methods were compared and

Unbelted Occupants (lateral distribution): For unbelted dummies, as shown previously, we have 
very limited data.  According to the Knapton report, there were two impacts at the front and rear 
portions of the window opening area, one at the A-pillar and the other at the B-pillar.  Although 
the number of impacts at the A- and B-pillars was small, it showed a distinctive difference when 
compared to the impact pattern observed with belted test dummies.  Table IV-29 showed that the 
majority of belted dummy impacts occurred at the B-pillar (83%, at the rear portion of the 
opening), whereas unbelted impacts were evenly distributed between the A-and B-pillars.  Due 
to the distinctive difference in distribution, we have decided to use the unbelted dummy impact 
     IV- 49 
data for the lateral distribution for unbelted occupants. The interior side impact data show that 
the impacts were more evenly distributed between the A- and B-pillars when compared to belted 
dummies, as shown below:

Similar to the approach used for the belted occupants, the likelihood of ejecting through a 
potential gap between A-pillar and the bag was derived, as shown below:

The results in Table VI-34 show that 50% of unbelted occupants would be ejected through the 
front ½ portion of the window opening area.  Similar to the method used for belted occupants, 
when the area is divided into four sections with the same width, 25% of unbelted occupants 
would be ejected through the front ½ portion of the window opening.  Similar to the method used 
for belted occupants, we assumed that unbelted occupants have 13% (25%/2 = 13%) chance of 
ejection through the front lower portion of the window opening area.    
     IV- 50 
 
Overall risk of ejection through front window opening: 
(A) Belted occupants: The analysis shows that there is a higher risk of ejection through the upper 
and rear portion of the front window opening.  When the opening is divided into three equal 
vertical areas, we estimated that the risk of ejection through the lower 1/3 of the opening would 
be 22%.  For each vertical section, we estimated that there are 83% (83.3%) risk of ejection 
through the rear half of the area and, 8% (8.3%) risk of ejection through the front ¼ of the 
window opening, as shown below:

The results in Table IV-35 show the risk of ejection through the front side window opening, 
which was based on the relative position of the headform and also rollover tests performed with 
selected vehicles.110  Due to limited data, we assumed that all AIS 3+ injuries, including 
fatalities, were all head-lead ejections in the analysis.  With the potential gaps in the front and 
bottom of the curtain air bag, we estimated that the hypothetical ejection mitigation curtain air 
bag would be 75% effective in preventing belted occupants from ejection through the front side 
window opening in rollover crashes.111   
                                                          
110 Previously, we discussed that the mass of the impactor in combination with the impact speed has sufficient 
kinetic energy to assure that the ejection mitigation countermeasure is able to protect a far-reaching population of 
people in real world crashes.    
111 The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer.  As shown in Figure IV-5, vehicle manufacturers may or may 
not cover the area between the front lower impact point (A1) and the A-pillar.  If the area is not covered, the 
containment effectiveness would be 71% (65% + 6% = 71%).  If the area is fully covered by attaching it to the A-
     IV- 51 
 
In the weighted risk containment method, we derived containment effectiveness values for belted 
and unbelted occupants.  However, we note that the degree of ejection (i.e., partial and complete) 
was not considered in the analysis.  In other words, the containment effectiveness (calculated 
with the potential gaps) would not tell whether the ejected occupants with a system that meets 
the proposed requirements have partial or complete ejections.  Although we do not have either 
laboratory or real world data, we suspect that the hypothetical ejection mitigation air bag (that is 
capable of meeting the requirements) would not allow complete ejections even with the potential 
gaps in most rollovers.            
   
(B) Unbelted occupants: The analysis shows that unbelted occupants would have a higher risk of 
ejection through the upper portion of the front window opening, when compared to belted 
occupants.  However, due to limited data, we used the effectiveness derived for belted occupants 
as a proxy: 78% for the upper 2/3 and 22% for the lower 1/3 portion of the window opening area.  
The lateral ejection distribution shows that the unbelted (occupant) ejections are more evenly 
distributed than belted occupants: assuming 25% risk of ejection through the opening, as shown 
below:             
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
pillar, the containment effectiveness would be 78% (65% + 6% +6% =78%).  For the analysis, we assumed that the 
bag would contain ½ of the ejection through the front upper 2/3 portion of the opening area (the shaded area in 
Figure IV-5).  Under the assumption, the containment effectiveness would be 75% (65% + 6% +6%x (1/2) = 75%, 
rounded to the nearest integer).

unbelted occupants from ejection through the front window opening in rollover crashes.112       
 
Ejection through Sunroof for Belted Occupants:  
In real world rollover crashes, some occupants are ejected through the sunroof (either partially or 
completely).  According to K. Digges, “Summary Report of Rollover Crashes,” FHWA/NHTSA 
National Crash Analysis Center, June 2002, about 17% of ejections occurred through the 
sunroof, as shown below:113   
Table IV-37

112  The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer.  19.4%+19.4%+19.4%+19.4%*(1/2) = 68%, rounded to the 
nearest integer.  
113 According to a briefing provide by Kennerly Digges, “Sources of Injury Harm in Rollover Crashes, The George 
Washington University, April 12, 2001, unrestrained occupants have 12% and 63% harm distributions for ejections 
through the sunroof and the side windows, respectively.     
     IV- 53 
Although we do not have data to show the number of seriously injured occupants who were 
ejected through the sunroof in lateral rollovers, we suspected the majority of sunroof ejections 
occurred during lateral rollover crashes.114  As shown in Tables IV-1 and IV-2, the agency’s real 
world crash data show that about 3% of serious and 2% of fatal injuries (5% of MAIS 3+) 
occurred when occupants were ejected through the sunroof.  During lateral rollover events, our 
analysis shows that side windows and the sunroof would be most likely ejections routes.  When 
ejections through side windows and the sunroof are considered, the crash data show that not 
more than 5% of the ejections occurred through the sunroof.115   
 
The rollover crash data show that some occupants would bounce off the interior components 
before ejecting through an opening (including sunroof) in certain rollovers.  However, when 
vehicles are equipped with window curtain bags, only a small number of adult occupants would 
rebound when they impact with a curtain bag in rollovers.  Therefore, we suspect that the actual 
percentage would be higher than the 5% estimated ejection rate, when vehicles have a curtain 
ejection mitigation system.116  Although a small number of adult occupants would rebound, we 
do not have data to quantify the number of these occupants.  Due to limited data, therefore, we 
assumed that 5% of all AIS 3+ (induced) ejections occur through the sunroof in rollovers and 
                                                          
114 Note that Knapton analyzed how test dummies impacted with the roof by body region and the number of quarter-
turns.  Unfortunately, the data do not include actual dummy impact points in the roof area.  As a result, we do not 
have laboratory data to estimate the risk of ejections through the sunroof.   
115 There were 5,271 serious (46.1%) and 6,174 fatal (53.9%) ejection injuries, a total of 11,445.  Among these 
injuries, 305 serious (5.5%) and 237 fatal (3.7%) injuries were from sunroof ejections.  Thus, (46.1%x5.5%) + 
(53.9%x3.7%) = 5%.     
116 The 5% ejection rate includes occupants who bounce off the interior component and also deployed air bag.  
When ejection curtains are in place, the total number of side ejection will decrease.  Therefore, we believe that the 
actual ejection rate through the sunroof would be higher than 5% when all vehicles are equipped with (rollover 
curtain bags).  However, we were unable to quantify the percentage of ejections through the sunroof with a curtain 
air bag meeting the proposed requirements.  
     IV- 54 
that (roof) glazing is not effective in preventing an occupant from ejection.117  (Note that the 5% 
sunroof ejection rate is based on 1997-2005 NASS and 2005 FARS.  We believe that a small 
number of these vehicles would be equipped with a sunroof since the majority of these vehicles 
are older model vehicles.  However, the number of vehicles equipped with the sunroof has 
increased steadily since MY 1997.  For example, the percentage of U.S. domestic passenger cars 
with a sunroof increased from 20.3% in MY 1999 to 25.3% in MY 2005.118  We expect that the 
sunroof ejection rate (estimated 5%) would also increase as the number of vehicles with a 
sunroof increases.  The sunroof and its effects on occupant safety are further discussed in 
Chapters VII.)  With the 5% ejection through the sunroof, the containment effectiveness would 
decrease from 75% to 71% for belted occupants and from 68% to 65% for unbelted occupants.119             
 
Overall Air Bag Containment Effectiveness in Rollovers: In the previous section, we analyzed 
the likelihood of ejection through potential gaps around the air bag for both belted and unbelted 
occupants in rollover crashes.  In addition, the risk of ejection through the sunroof was also 
considered in the analysis, as shown below:     
 
 
                                                          
117 We are not aware of any strength or impact requirements for roof glazing.  Although some roof glazing would be 
as strong as advanced glazing used in the side window opening, we do not have data on the strength of roof glazing.  
Therefore, we assumed that roof glazing is not effective in preventing ejection.  Since not all sunroof ejections 
occurred in lateral rollovers, the assumption would overestimate the risk of ejection through the sunroof in lateral 
rollovers (i.e., when ejection through side windows and the sunroof are considered).  Consequently, the assumption 
would underestimate the containment effectiveness.  
118 The percentages are based on Ward’s 2000 & 2006.  In addition, as part of the ejection mitigation rulemaking 
effort, the agency performed a field survey of current vehicles.  The survey showed that about 37% of MY 2007 
were equipped with the sunroof.   
119 Previously we estimated that bags are 75% effective in preventing belted occupants from ejection through the 
window opening area.  With 5% ejection through the sunroof, the effectiveness would decrease from 75% to 71% 
(75%effectivenessx95%window + 0%effectivenessx5%sunroof = 71%, for unbelted: 68%x95% + 0%x5% = 65%), as shown in 
Table IV-38.  As discussed, the actual sunroof ejection rate would be lower than 5% when all vehicles are equipped 
with a curtain ejection mitigation system, with the existing sunroof installation rate.

The vertical containment rates show that when the front window opening area is completely 
covered by a rollover air bag (i.e., meet the 100 mm headform displacement requirement) the air 
bag would prevent 78% of both belted and unbelted occupants from ejection.120  However, 
among these occupants, a small number of occupants (3% of belted and 10% of unbelted) could 
be ejected through the front-bottom corner of the opening.  When they are combined, the 
analysis shows that the hypothetical ejection mitigation curtain air bag would be 75% effective 
for belted and 68% effective for unbelted occupants in preventing ejection through the front 
window opening in lateral rollover crashes121 when the air bag meets the proposed headform 
displacement requirement.122  The 75% and 68% containment effective rates were then adjusted 
with the 5% sunroof ejection rate for both belted and unbelted occupants, respectively, to derive 
the 71% and 65% overall containment effectiveness rates for belted and unbelted occupants, 
respectively.123   
                                                          
120 As discussed previously, due to limited data, we used the belted ejection rate for unbelted occupants, as a proxy. 
121 The term “lateral roll” is used to describe rollovers that occur about vehicle’s longitudinal axis.  
122 As discussed previously, we assumed that some occupants who are initially contained by the bag would be 
ejected through the sunroof.   
123 The derived effectiveness rates are based on the likelihood of partial and complete head ejections in rollover 
crashes.  Therefore, one would argue that the effectiveness rates should be applied exclusively to head/face injuries 
and, consequently, other body injuries should not be included in the target population.  On the other hand, real world 
crashes data show that the majority of serious injuries are head/face injuries in rollover crashes.  According to 
Digges, in a report titled “Summary Report of Rollover Crashes,” June 2002, about 45% of all Harms were from 
     IV- 56 
 
 
B.2.2.2.2 Uniform risk of ejection: Previously, we discussed the risk of ejection through a 
particular area in the window opening under the assumption that the risk of ejection is 
proportional to the likelihood of impacts with areas surrounding the window opening in 
rollovers.  As discussed, the agency does not have direct knowledge of actual ejection route 
through the window opening in rollovers.  As an alternative to the weighted risk of ejection, we 
examined how potential benefits differ when the risk of ejection through the window opening is 
assumed to be uniformly distributed. 
  
Although we do not have a direct knowledge of occupant ejection paths in the opening, 
laboratory and real world crash data indicate that the ejections may not uniformly distributed in 
the opening and the risk of ejection through the upper portion of the opening may be higher than 
the risk of ejection through the lower portion of the opening, particularly in the first few quarter 
turns of a rollover.  How such an assumption would hold in the more sever rollovers that make 
up the majority of the benefits of the proposed rule is not well understood.124  In other words, if 
we assume that ejections are uniformly distributed in the window opening, the risk of ejection 
through the potential gaps (below the curtain) would be greater than the estimated risk that was 
used in the weighted risk method.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
head related injuries.  Based on the observation, we believe that a bag that is capable of preventing the head of an 
occupant from ejection would be effective in preventing other body injuries in most crashes (i.e., injuries would 
have occurred if an occupant had been ejected through the window opening).    
124 As discussed in the benefit chapter, a study performed by GM found that the majority of maximum resultant 
membrane attachment loads occur at the rear attachments with 43% of the maximum loads occurring at the upper 
rear corner and 33% occurring at the lower rear corner.  The GM test data indicate that the risk of ejection through 
the lower portion of the window opening is lower than the risk of ejection through the upper portion of window 
opening.  We note that this study is not representative of the majority of the target population of the proposed rule 
since about half of the tests were restricted to less than one quarter turn and no test was more than 2 quarter turns.       
     IV- 57 
The uniform risk of ejection method is simpler and easier to understand than the weighted risk of 
ejection method.  In addition, as mentioned previously, the “uniform” method does not require 
any laboratory or real world data and would not distinguish belted and unbelted occupant 
ejections for the containment effectiveness.   
 
Previously, we estimated that rollover curtain bags may not be effective in preventing ejection 
when such ejection occur through the lower 1/3 portion of the opening, even if these bags meet 
the displacement requirement.  If we assume that all ejections are uniformly distributed in the 
window opening, the bag would allow 1/3 of ejections through the potential gap in rollover 
crashes (resulting in a 67% containment effectiveness rate).  When the 67% containment rate is 
adjusted with the 5% ejection rate through the sunroof, it would result in a 63% overall 
containment rate (67%containment, uniform risk - 67%x5%ejection through sunroof = 63%).125  
 
Since the risk of ejection through the upper portion of the window opening would be greater than 
the risk of ejection through the lower portion, the containment effectiveness based on an 
assumption that ejections are evenly distributed would be regarded as a minimum containment 
effectiveness (assuming that the hypothetical ejection mitigation system is not effective in 
preventing ejection through a potential gap between the curtain and the window sill).   
 
We note that the use of the minimum containment effectiveness would not significantly affect 
the benefits estimate.  One of the reasons for the insensitivity is that about 38% of the lives saved 
                                                          
125 As discussed later in the chapter, when the 63% containment effectiveness rate is used, the overall system 
effectiveness rate decreases from 45%weight, belted and unbelted to 43% for rollover crashes.   Previously we estimated that 
248 and 154 additional lives would be saved in rollover and side crashes, respectively.  When the uniform risk is 
used, we expect that 390 additional lives would be saved.  Among the 390 lives, 237 were from the rollover 
population and the remaining 152 were from the side impact.  See Appendix E for additional information  
     IV- 58 
were from occupants who were ejected in side crashes that were considered in the target 
population (154/402 = 38%).  As discussed in the benefit chapter, these fatalities would not be 
affected by the “uniformly distributed” ejections in the window opening in rollovers.126 
    
3. Injury risks associated with remaining inside the vehicle:   
 
As part of the Advanced Glazing Project of NHTSA,127 which was to reduce the number of 
fatalities and serious injuries in motor vehicle crashes due to ejection, Winnicki estimated the 
number of lives saved and serious injuries prevented when ejection is eliminated.  His analysis 
utilized state data files maintained by NCSA, NHTSA.128  It employs the double-pair comparison 
methodology to compare the injury rates in various severity levels among the ejected and the 
non-ejected vehicle occupants.  Since complete ejection is rare among occupants of motor 
vehicle using the safety belts, his analysis was restricted to the unrestrained occupants.  Due to 
limited data, the reduction rates based on the unrestrained occupants were used in the analysis.   
 
Although we do not have statistically significant crash data, we believe that belted occupants 
would have a higher percent injury reduction rate when compared to unbelted occupants (when 
they remain inside the vehicle).  According to Digges (in a report titled “Summary Report of 
Rollover Crashes”), brain/head are the most injured body regions (9.8% for brain and 13.3% for 
                                                          
126 Under the uniform risk assumption, the curtain system would prevent 296 serious injuries, annually.  When the 
equivalent life saved was discounted by 3% and 7%, it resulted in 359 and 285 equivalent fatalities.  With the 
$583M incremental total cost, the cost per equivalent life saved would be $1.63M and $2.04M, respectively.  The 
net-benefit would be $1,605M and $1,158M at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively.  
127 The study is for advanced glazing, which is a passive device in preventing occupants from ejection.  Technically, 
there is no “sensor” in the passive containment system.  However, for the discussion, we could say the system 
(glazing) is 100% effective in detecting crash events since the system is always “on” when windows are in “up” 
position.

Glazing,” John Winnicki, DOT HS 808 369, February 1996.

head).  He reports that a small number of the head/face injuries would occur as a result of 
impacts with the interior components, as shown below:

Table IV-39 shows that about 4% and 13% of the brain/head injuries were from impacts with the 
interior components for belted and unbelted, respectively.  Since most brain injuries would be 
serious injuries,129 one could conclude that unbelted occupants would have a higher risk of injury 
even if they remain inside of the vehicle.  The data suggest that unbelted occupants would move

injuries but accounting for about 55% of the comprehensive Harm.  
     IV- 60 
around and the head of an unbelted occupant impacts interior objects much more than belted 
occupants in rollover.  For example, we assumed there is an occupant who had a head injury as a 
result from contacting the ground in rollover (assume a chance of injury is “1”).  When the 
ejection is prevented and occupant is belted, the data suggested that the belted occupant would 
move less freely around inside the vehicle and have a lower chance of head contacts with the 
interior components (with a “x” chance of injury) compared to when the occupant is not belted 
(with a “y” chance of injury, with “y” > “x”).  If occupants are contained inside a vehicle, belted 
occupants would have a higher percent reduction rate when compared to unbelted occupants.130  
In other words, belted occupants would have a higher percent reduction rate when compared to 
unrestrained occupants when they remain inside the vehicle.  Therefore, the use of the reduction 
rates (i.e., Winnicki’s) based on the unrestrained occupants for both belted and unbelted 
occupants would underestimate the overall effectiveness.         
      
Ejections Occurred in Rollovers: In the Winnicki report, an analysis by crash type shows that the 
greatest benefits of ejection prevention occur in rollover crashes (86% reduction in fatalities for 
driver and 90% reduction in fatalities for passenger).  When partial and complete ejections are 
considered separately, it reports that the relative risk of fatality is reduced by 85.6% for partially 
ejected drivers and 87.1% for completely ejected drivers when ejection is eliminated in rollover 
crashes.  For passengers, the relative risk of fatality is reduced by 90.1% for partially ejected 
drivers and 89.7% for completely ejected drivers.   
   
                                                          
130 As discussed in the target population section, we excluded fatalities from catastrophic rollovers.  In other words, 
we only considered non-catastrophic rollovers where the structure of a vehicle remains intact.    
     IV- 61 
For the benefit analysis, we utilized the reduction rates derived by Winnicki by averaging (i.e., 
simple average, not weighted) the driver’s and passenger’s relative risk reduction rates, as shown 
below: 
 
 
Table IV-40 
Average Fatal Injury Risk Reduction Rates in Rollovers

Driver: 86% 87% 
Passenger: 90% 90% 
Avg. (rounded): 88% 88% 
Difference between driver and passenger:   4%   3% 
 
The results in Table IV-40 show that both partially and completely ejected occupants in rollover 
crashes would have a similar fatal injury reduction rate (88%).  One of the assumptions used in 
Winnicki’s analysis is that the effect of being prevented from ejection by the advanced glazing is 
the same as the effect of being prevented from ejection by other elements of vehicle interior 
components.  By utilizing the reduction rates, we are assuming that the effect of being prevented 
from ejection by air bags is the same as the effect of being prevented from ejection by other 
elements of vehicle interior components.           
 
Ejections Occurred in Side Impacts: According to Winnicki, on average, the relative risk of 
fatality would be reduced by 49% for partially ejected occupants and 41% for completely ejected 
occupants in side crashes when ejection is eliminated, as shown below:

For left side impacts, the rates are 37% for drivers (near-side) and 68% for front passengers (far-
side) in complete ejection side crashes; for right side impacts 79% for drivers (far-side) and 45% 
for front passengers (near-side) in complete ejection side crashes, as shown below:

The fatal reduction rates show that near-side occupants are more vulnerable to fatal injuries and 
would have a higher fatal risk even if they are contained inside vehicles in side crashes when 
compared to far-side occupants. 
   
For the analysis, we used the reduction rates derived for near-side occupants: drivers for left side 
impacts and front passengers for right side impacts.131 Accordingly, the hypothetical curtain 
(rollover) bag would be 37% and 45% effective in protecting drivers and front passenger who are 
                                                          
131 The rates would be minimum reduction rates, and the use of these rates would underestimate the potential 
benefits.  We could use a simple average or weighted average of near and far side for the Final Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (FRIA).

rates are 57% for drivers and 40% for front passengers, as shown below:

In the method section in this chapter, we said that the basic estimation procedure consists of four 
steps: B.1 group fatal and serious injuries (MAIS 3-5) by crash type (rollover or side impacts), 
ejection type (partial or complete) and belt use; B.2 calculate performance of the ejection 
mitigation air bag system; B.3 calculate overall percentage reduction rates; and B.4 derive 
benefits.  The following section B.3 discusses the methodology used to calculate overall percent 
reduction rates for each subgroup. 
  
B.3 Overall Percent Reduction Rate: Rollover crashes are complex events.  As a result, the 
effectiveness of an occupant ejection mitigation system depends on several factors, such as 
sensitivity of its sensor, size of the curtain, deployment time, operation/inflation duration, and 
chamber gas pressure, etc.  For the benefit analysis, we assumed that its effectiveness is directly 
and solely related to three factors: its sensor, containment effectiveness, and the risk of receiving 
injuries when occupants are contained inside vehicles in crashes.  Our analysis shows that many 
crash conditions (crash mode, belt use, partial/complete ejection, etc.) would affect the 
effectiveness of these factors (sensor, containment & risk of remaining in the vehicle).   The 
overall system effectiveness shows that rollover air bags would be reasonably effective in 
     IV- 64 
preventing occupant ejection in most fatal rollover crashes (about 45%132 as presented in Table 
IV-45).  However, for belted occupants who were completely ejected through the opening, we 
believe that these occupants were involved in very severe rollover crashes such that the 
containment system may not be capable of preventing these occupants from ejection and/or the 
structure cannot withstand the impact forces in such severe crashes.  Accordingly, for the benefit 
analysis, we assumed that the system is not effective in protecting completely ejected belted 
occupants in rollover crashes.  For unbelted occupants who were completely ejected through the 
opening, we believe that some of these occupants were involved in very severe crashes that the 
vehicle’s structure cannot withstand the crash loads.  However, we do not have data to quantify 
these occupants.  According to our rollover crash data (as shown in Table IV-5), there were 595 
belted occupant fatalities.  Among the 595 belted occupant fatalities, 538 were partial and the 
remaining 57 were from complete ejections.  Since belted occupants would remain in the vehicle 
as long as the structure withstands the loads, we reasoned that the vehicle’s structure did not 
withstand the loads for the 57 fatal belted occupants.  The assumption implies that all partially 
ejected belted occupants who were fatally injured were not from catastrophic rollover crashes. 
Under the assumption, the risk of non-catastrophic fatal crashes (that the structure of a vehicle 
can withstand the loads) would be about 9 times higher than the risk of catastrophic fatal crashes 
(538/57 = 9.4 times, or 9.58% of all belted fatalities would be from catastrophic crashes, 57/595 
= 9.58%).  In other words, the number of fatalities in catastrophic crashes would be 9.4 times 
smaller than the number of fatalities resulting from partial ejections.  For unbelted occupants, 
there were 3,073 fatalities in rollovers.  Among the 3,073 unbelted fatalities, 515 were from 
partial ejections and the remaining 2,558 were from unbelted complete ejections.  Note that for 
                                                          
132 The target population shows that 15% of the fatalities were belted and the remaining 85% were unbelted 
occupants.  In the following section, we estimated that the ejection mitigation system has an overall effectiveness of 
48% for partially ejected belted occupants and 44% for unbelted occupants: (15% x 48%) + (85% x 44%) = 45%.   
     IV- 65 
the fatally injured belted occupants, we assumed that all completely ejected occupants were 
from catastrophic rollovers.  However, it would not be reasonable to make such assumption for 
unbelted occupants since the risk of ejection of unbelted occupants would be much higher than 
that of belted occupants in rollovers.  In other words, some of completely ejected occupants 
would be from none catastrophic rollovers.  If we assume that the occurrence of catastrophic 
fatal crashes is independent of belt use, as discussed above, the number of fatalities in 
catastrophic crashes would be 9.4 times smaller than the number of fatalities resulting from 
partial ejections.  Therefore, 55 fatalities out of the 2,558 complete-unbelted ejections (515 partial 
ejection /9.4) = 55) would be from catastrophic fatal crashes.  Similar to the methodology used for 
the belted complete fatalities, we assumed that crashes were too severe for the mitigation system 
to be effective for the 55 unbelted complete fatalities in rollovers (i.e., 55 fatalities out of the 
2,558 unbelted complete ejections were from catastrophic rollover  crashes, i.e., 2.13% of the 
2,558 of the complete unbelted fatalities).  Accordingly, these unbelted partial ejection fatalities 
were not considered in the target population.133  For side impacts, the overall effectiveness 
ranges from 21% to as high as 49%.  The complete list of overall system effectiveness rates for 
fatally injured occupants is shown below: 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
133 As discussed, we do not know the number of fatalities resulting from catastrophic rollover crashes.  Since it is 
unlikely that all belted complete ejection fatalities were from catastrophic rollover crashes, the assumption (that the 
ejection mitigation system is not effective in these fatal crashes) would underestimate the benefit.  On the other 
hand, some fatal partial ejections (whether belted or not) could be from catastrophic rollover crashes.

In the previous section, we analyzed the likelihood of ejection through potential gaps around the 
air bag in rollover crashes.  Two methods namely “weighted risk of ejection” and “uniform risk 
of ejection” were used to derive the containment effectiveness.  First, for the weighted risk of 
ejection method, the impact distribution was based on laboratory and real world crash data.  
Containment effectiveness was then derived from assumptions about window area coverage 
(71% for belted and 65% for unbelted occupants).  For the uniform risk method, we assumed that 
ejections are evenly distributed in the opening area (63% for both belted and unbelted).  As 
shown tables above, the weighted risk of ejection method and the uniform risk of ejection 
     IV- 68 
method produced similar effectiveness estimates, but the weighted risk had a slightly lower 
overall effectiveness value for rollovers.   
 
For side crashes, however, we did not have laboratory dummy impact distribution data to derive 
the containment effectiveness rate.  Rather, we assumed that a rollover curtain air bag is effective 
in preventing complete ejection in a very narrow delta-V range.  In the FMVSS No. 214 Final 
Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) for the oblique pole, we estimated that the FMVSS No. 214-
curtain air bag system would be effective in a lateral delta-V range of 12-25 mph.  In addition, 
the oblique pole test results showed that the head of a test dummy must be in contact with the 
curtain to be effective in the delta-V range.   
 
In the FMVSS No. 214 FRIA, the agency determined that the FMVSS No. 214 curtain air bag 
system could prevent some complete ejections in side crashes.  However, we could not quantify 
the effectiveness for this crash mode and ejection status.  Consequently, we assumed that the 
FMVSS No. 214 curtain air bag would not be effective in preventing occupants from complete 
ejection in side crashes.  The agency believes that a curtain air bag that is capable of meeting 
both the FMVSS No. 214-oblique and the proposed linear headform test requirements would be 
effective in preventing occupant ejection through the window opening in a lateral delta-V range 
of 12-25 mph.  In the FMVSS No. 214 FRIA for the oblique pole, the agency determined a total 
of 9,270 fatalities would occur in side impact crashes (passenger vehicles, based on 2004 FARS).  
Among the 9,270 fatalities, 306 were from side crashes preceded by rollovers and the remaining 
8,963 were from non-rollover side crashes.  When the 8,963 were categorized by occupant 
seating position, it showed that 2,877 were from far-side adult occupants and 5,591 were from 
     IV- 69 
near-side adult occupants.  Among the 5,591 near-side occupants, 2,551 were from side crashes 
occurred in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph (i.e., 46% of the 5,591 fatalities, and the remaining 
3,040 were from other delta-V’s).  Among the 2,551 fatalities, 207 were from completely ejected 
adult occupants (8.1% of the 2,551 fatalities) in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph.  If we assume that 
near-side occupants have the same risk of complete ejection in all vehicle delta-V’s, there would 
be 246 completely ejected adult fatalities in the other delta-V’s (i.e., not 12-25 mph, 3,040 x 
8.1% = 246).  Therefore, a total of 453 fatalities would be from completely ejected near-side 
adult occupants in side crashes (in all delta-V’s, 207 + 246 = 453).  According to Kahane, head 
curtains reduce the risk of fatal occupant ejection in side impacts by a statistically significant 30 
percent.134  Therefore, about 136 lives could be saved among the 453 fatal complete ejections 
(453 x 30% = 136).  In the ejection mitigation analysis, we estimated that the curtain ejection 
mitigation curtain air bag would be 49% and 41% effective for belted and unbelted, respectively, 
in a narrow delta-V range of 12 -25 mph fatal side crashes (as shown in Table IV-45).  When the 
effectiveness rates were applied to the 207 completely ejected adult occupants in a delta-V range 
of 12-25 mph, about 90 lives would be saved in the side crashes (207 x 46%if all belted = 95 and  
207x 41%if all unbelted = 85).  The above calculation illustrates that the assumption (that the 
hypothetical ejection mitigation system is only effective in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph in side 
crashes) would somewhat underestimate the benefits.  In summary, it appears that the derived 
49% and 41% system effectiveness rates would be reasonable when compared to the estimate 
made with real world crash data.

For serious injuries, the derivation shows that the ejection mitigation system would be less 
effective when compared to fatal injuries.  The effectiveness ranges from 20% for unbelted 
completely ejected occupants in side-then-roll crashes to 49% for belted ejections in side 
crashes.135  The complete list of overall system effectiveness rates for serious injuries is shown

B.4 Derive Benefit:    
B.4.1 Lives saved and injuries prevented by ejection mitigation system. To comply with the 
proposed ejection mitigation requirements, vehicle manufacturers would most likely install 
rollover curtain air bag systems in their vehicles.  Although the agency has limited real world 
crash data, the agency’s DRF and linear headform test data show that rollover air bags would be 
very effective in preventing occupants from ejection in rollover and certain side crashes.136  For

so complete ejection did not occur in a simulated rollover crash environment.  The test devices/curtains (TRW air

potential benefits, separate analyses were performed for five sub-target population groups: (A) 
rollover crashes without side impacts; (B) side impacts followed by rollovers, excluding 12-25 
vehicle delta-V’s; (C) side impacts followed by rollovers in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 
mph; (D) side impacts without rollover crashes in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 mph; (E) 
Children in side impacts without rollover crashes in a vehicle delta-V range of 12-25 mph.  
 
A. Rollover Crashes without Side Impacts 
Lives Saved: When all light vehicles are equipped with the ESC system, we estimated a total of 
749 fatalities would occur in rollover crashes, annually.  Among the 749 fatalities, 218 would be 
from partial ejections and the remaining 531 would be from complete ejections.  Among the 531 
complete fatal ejections, 519 were from unbelted occupants.  Previously we estimated that about 
2.13% of the complete unbelted fatalities would be from catastrophic crashes where the structure 
would not withstand the crash loads.  Accordingly, these fatalities were excluded from the target 
population.  The system effectiveness for these crashes ranges from zero percent for completely 
ejected belted occupants to 48% for partially ejected belted occupants.  When the system is fully 
implemented, we expect a total of 332 lives would be saved, annually, in rollover crashes, as 
shown below:

Injuries prevented: We estimated a total of 783 serious injuries (MAIS 3-5) would occur in 
rollover crashes, annually.  Among the 783 serious injuries, 311 would be from partial ejections 
and the remaining 472 would be from complete ejections.  When the catastrophic crashes were 
excluded, it resulted in 449 completely ejected seriously injured occupants in the target 
population.137  The system effectiveness rate ranges from zero percent for completely ejected 
belted to 40% for partially ejected belted occupants.  When the system is fully implemented, we 
expect a total of 245 serious injuries would be prevented, annually, in rollover crashes, as shown 
below:

B. Side Impacts Followed by Rollovers, Excluding 12-25 mph Vehicle Delta-V      
Lives saved: We estimated a total of 251 fatalities would be in the target population of ejections 
for side impacts followed by rollovers at all but 12 -25 mph vehicle delta-V’s, annually.138  
Among the 251 fatalities, 137 would be from partially ejected unbelted occupants and the 
remaining 114 would be from completely ejected unbelted occupants.  When the system is fully 
implemented, we expect a total of 57 lives would be saved, annually, as shown below:      
 
                                                          
137 There were 56 completely ejected and 1,078 partially ejected serious injuries: 56/1,078 = 5.2%.  We assumed that 
5.2% of the 2,094 unbelted complete ejection injuries would be from catastrophic crashes.  Similar to the 
methodology used for the fatalities, these crashes were excluded from the target population. 
138 As discussed in the target population section, we have a separate benefit analysis for the 12-25 mph side crashes 
followed by rollovers.

Injuries prevented: For the target population, we estimated a total of 210 serious injuries would 
occur in the crashes, annually.  Among the 210 seriously injured occupants, 49 would be from 
partial ejections and the remaining 161 would be from complete ejections.  When the system is 
fully implemented, we expect a total of 42 serious injuries would be prevented, annually, as 
shown below:

Note that the number of serious injuries prevented in this side impact case shows that a relatively 
small number of serious injuries would be prevented in side crashes when compared to the 
potential benefits in rollovers.  The relatively low potential benefits are mainly due to the smaller 
target population.            
   
C. Side Impacts Followed by Rollovers in Vehicle Delta-V Range of 12-25 mph 
     IV- 75 
Lives saved: We estimated a total of 79 fatalities would occur in the target population of 
ejections for side impacts followed by rollover crashes, annually.  Among the 79 fatalities, 11 
would be from completely ejected belted occupants and the remaining 68 would be from 
completely ejected unbelted occupants.  Note that the FMVSS No. 214-benefit assessment 
included potential benefits for belted and unbelted occupants who were partially ejected in fatal 
side impacts in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph.  Accordingly, the FMVSS No. 214-fatal benefits 
were excluded from the ejection mitigation benefit estimate.  We estimated that the system 
would save 18 lives, annually, as summarized below:

Injuries prevented: We estimated a total of 310 serious injuries would occur in side impacts 
followed by rollover crashes, annually: 108 from partial and 202 from complete ejections.  As 
discussed, we included potential benefits for both partially and completely ejected occupants 
who were seriously injured in a delta-V range of 12-25 mph.  When fully implemented, we 
expect a total of 84 serious injuries would be prevented by the ejection mitigation system, 
annually.  The estimated benefits are shown below:

D. Side Impacts without Rollover Crashes in Vehicle Delta-V Range of 12-25 mph: 
Lives saved: Similar to the side impacts with subsequent rollovers in a delta-V range of 12-25 
mph, only unbelted occupants who were completely ejected in fatal side impacts in the delta-V 
range were considered.  For the target population, we estimated a total of 259 fatalities would 
occur in side impacts without rollover crashes, annually.  When the system is fully implemented, 
we expect a total of 106 lives would be saved, annually, in non-rollover side impacts, as shown 
below:

Injuries prevented: For the benefit analysis, only occupants who were completely ejected in side 
impacts in the delta-V range (12 – 25 mph) were considered.  We estimated a total of 75 serious 
injuries would occur in side impacts without rollover crashes, annually.  These 75 seriously 
injures would be from completely ejected unbelted occupants.  When the system is fully 
implemented, we expect a total of 28 serious injuries would be prevented in non-rollover 12-25 
mph side impacts, annually, as shown below:

We note that the benefit estimates are based on assumptions that side impacts sensors are 
effective in detecting crashes in the delta-V range and that air bags designed to solely meet the 
FMVSS No. 214-pole test requirements are not capable of preventing unbelted occupants from 
complete ejection in 12-25 mph side crashes.    
 
E. Children (0-12 years) in Side Impact with No Rollover in Delta-V of 12 -25 mph:  
Lives saved: For children in side impacts without subsequent rollovers in a delta-V range of 12-
25 mph, both partially and completely ejected children were considered in the delta-V range.  
We estimated that a total of 54 child fatalities would occur in 12-25 mph side impacts without 
rollover crashes, annually, when all applicable vehicles are equipped with ESC.  Among the 54 
fatalities (rounded to the nearest integer), 25 were from completely ejected unbelted children and 
the remaining 29 were from partially ejected belted children.  When the system is fully 
implemented, we expect a total of 24 lives would be saved, annually, in non-rollover side 
impacts, as shown below:

     IV- 78 
of 16 serious injuries would be prevented, annually, in non-rollover 12-25 mph side impacts, as 
shown below:

Figure IV-6 Lives Saved by Window Ejection Mitigation System, with 100% ESC 
In summary, as shown in Figure IV-6, the hypothetical ejection mitigation system would save 
538 lives and prevent 414 serious injuries, annually, when the system is fully implemented.  The 
majority of the potential benefits would be from protecting occupants in rollover crashes.  About 
62 % of the fatal and 59% of the serious injury benefits would be from the rollover protection.139

B.4.2  Incremental benefits over MY 2011 voluntary installations: The benefit estimate was 
based on an assumption that the vehicles (involved in the rollover and side crashes) were not 
equipped with ejection mitigation air bags, as shown in Table IV-57.

However, vehicle sales data submitted by manufacturers show that about 55% of MY 2011 
vehicles will be equipped with a rollover ejection mitigation system (i.e., typically, consist of 
two curtain air bags and a rollover sensor per vehicle).  Based on our linear headform test results, 
we believe that some of the systems would be effective in preventing occupants from ejection in 
certain crashes.  Accordingly, the estimated benefits (in terms of lives saved and injuries 
     IV- 80 
prevented) were adjusted with the potential benefits of these air bags: the number of MY 2011 
vehicles that are equipped with rollover air bags and also the compliance rate.140  For the 
adjustment, individual air bag type was not considered; rather it was assumed that vehicles are 
equipped with production curtain rollover bags regardless of vehicle model or type.  For the 
compliance rate (i.e., passing rate for the proposed linear guided headform test requirements), 
each impact point was considered separately and the linear headform tests performed at an 
impact speed of 24 km/h at 1.5 second delay were used141, as shown in Table IV-58

140 The compliance rate is based on pre-MY 2007 vehicles.  By applying the pre-MY 2007 vehicle compliance rate, 
we are assuming that the performance of the MY 2007 bags remains unchanged.    
141 The use of the 24 km/h (with 1.5 second delay) headform data does not imply that air bags that meet the 
deflection requirement in this test condition would be in compliance with the proposed requirements.  In other 
words, we expect that not all bags that meet the 24 km/h impact requirement will be in compliance with the 
proposed requirements at 6 second delay.  Accordingly, the use of the 24 km/h performance data, as a proxy, would 
underestimate the (overall) additional benefits by overestimating their passing rates. 
     IV- 81 
The linear headform test results show that none of the curtain air bags met the displacement 
requirement at A1, whether laminated glazing is used or not.142  In contrast, none of the vehicles 
failed the requirement at A4.143   
 
Risk of ejection at each impact point: In the containment effectiveness analysis section, we 
derived the risk of ejection through a particular area in the window opening.  Similar to the 
approach used in the containment analysis, the window opening was divided into four areas (i.e., 
quadrant).  To determine the risk of ejection through each quadrant in the window opening area, 
we assumed that any ejection through a particular quadrant is represented by the impact point at 
that quadrant.  In other words, if the air bag meets the headform displacement requirement at a 
particular impact point, we assumed that the air bag would be effective in preventing occupants 
from ejection through that quadrant.144  The risk of ejection through each quadrant for both 
belted and unbelted occupants are shown below:       
Table IV-60

142 The laminated glazing is primarily designed for theft protection, not ejection mitigation. 
143 For additional discussion, see Chapter III, “Test Data.” 
144 For the compliance rate, we assumed that a curtain bag would be effective in preventing occupants from ejection 
through a particular quadrant if the bag meets the headform displacement requirement at that impact point.  
However, as discussed in the containment estimation section, the bag would allow certain ejections through the 
potential gaps even if it meets the displacement requirement at a given impact point in the window opening area.  
Therefore, the use of the assumption would underestimate the (overall) additional benefits by overestimating the 
containment effectiveness rate of current bags.  
145 We note that the percentages do not add up to 100% since we assumed that about 5% of occupants would be 
ejected through the sunroof when such ejections occur.  For example, previously we estimated that belted occupants 
would have 67% chance of ejection through the upper portion and 83% chance of ejection through the rear portion 
of the window opening.  With the 95% window ejection rate, we estimated that about 56% of ejections would occur 
through this quadrant (67%x83%x95% = 53%).    
     IV- 82 
The results in Table VI -60 show that the majority of belted occupants would be ejected through 
the rear portion of the window opening (53%), whereas most unbelted occupants would be 
ejected through the upper portion of the opening.  For both belted and unbelted occupants, with 
the weighted risk of ejection methodology, the risk of ejection through the front lower corner (of 
the window opening) would be relatively low.  However, as mentioned previously, the 
movement of an occupant after he/she contacts the air bag was not considered in the weighted 
risk of ejection method.  In other words, although the weighted risk of ejection method showed 
that the initial risk of ejection through the front lower corner is low, the risk of ejection through 
the area could increase when the occupant movement is considered.  In addition, we note that the 
risk of ejection through the area would be the same as any other areas in the window opening 
when the uniform risk of ejection method/assumption is used.                 
 
For the risk of ejection through each quadrant, we considered belted and unbelted occupants 
together.  The agency’s real world crash data show that 15% of all fatal window ejections were 
from belted occupant and the remaining 85% were from unbelted occupants.146  These belt use 
rates for fatally ejected occupants (15% and 85%) were used to derive a weighted risk of ejection 
at a given quadrant in the window opening, as shown below: 
Table IV-61 
Weighted Risk of Ejection through Front Window Opening Area

146 As shown previously in the target population section, there were 640 belted and 3,755 unbelted fatalities (a total 
of 4,395) when occupants were ejected through side window openings.  Among the 640 belted fatalities, 595 were 
from the 1st row window opening and the remaining 45 were from the 2nd row window opening.  For unbelted 
occupants, 3,076 were from the 1st row window opening, 641were from 2nd and the remaining 38 were from the 3rd 
row window opening.   
147 As discussed in Footnote 152, we assumed that 5% of the ejections would occur through the sunroof. 
     IV- 83 
Table IV-61 shows that the risk of ejection through each quadrant ranges from 14% at the lower 
forward section to 35% at the upper rear portion of the front window (near the B-pillar) when 
both belted and unbelted are considered.  The results show that the majority of ejections would 
be through the upper portion of the opening (64%148).  To derive the percent of ejections that 
could be prevented (if all applicable vehicles are equipped with currently available air bag 
systems), the passing rate (i.e., compliance rate) was applied to the weighted risk of ejection for 
each impact point, as shown below: 
Table IV-62 
Probability of Ejection Prevented with Current Rollover Air Bags  
Front Window Opening Area 
(Both belted and unbelted occupants)  
Impact Point A1 A2 A3 A4 Total 
Passing rate 0% 30% 22% 100%  
Weighted risk of ejection 14% 17% 29% 35%  
% of ejection prevented  0% 5% 6% 35% 46% 
 
The results in Table IV-62 show that currently available ejection mitigation air bags would be 
most effective in preventing occupants from ejection through the upper rear portion of the 
window opening (near B-pillar); the majority of ejections would occur through this upper portion 
of the opening area.  When the risk of ejection and the passing rate are combined, the results 
show that the current rollover curtain air bags would prevent about 46% of front window 
ejections when both belted and unbelted occupants are considered.            
 
Potential benefits result from voluntarily installed rollover air bags: The percent of ejection 
prevented was applied to the number of vehicles that will be equipped with currently available 
                                                          
148 29% at the A3 and 35% at the A4 = 64%, when both belted and unbelted fatalities were considered.

rollover air bags.  For the baseline air bags sales, we utilized MY 2011 vehicles149 that will be 
equipped with rollover air bags, as shown below:

When the weighted risk of ejection is adjusted with the MY 2011 rollover air bag installation 
rate, it resulted in a 25% adjustment factor (46% effectiveness, currently available air bag systems x 55%installation 
rate = 25% (25.27%)).  In other words, if we assume that (1) all vehicles are equipped with ESC, 
(2) the performance of current rollover bags remains unchanged, and (3) future rollover bag sales 
are same as the projected sales in MY 2011 vehicles, about 25% of the total potential benefits 
would be realized by these bag systems.  When the 25% adjustment factor was applied to the 
previously derived potential benefits150, it resulted in 402 additional lives saved and 310 serious 
injuries prevented,151 as shown below:

149 Although the phase-in begins in MY 2014, the MY 2011 vehicle data is most current data we have.  
150 Additional benefit = potential benefit x (1-25%).  If the performance of current ejection mitigation curtain air bag 
remains unchanged, 55% of the 46% of MY 2011 vehicles would be meet the proposed displacement requirement.  
Therefore, without the proposed rule, 25% of MY 2011 vehicles would meet the displacement requirement.  The 
potential benefits from the 25% complying vehicles were subtracted from the potential benefits.         
151 The methodology implies that curtain bags do not have any beneficial effects in reducing injury severity when an 
occupant impacts with a particular window opening area that failed the headform displacement requirement.  We 
suspect that certain bags would provide some benefits even if they failed to meet the displacement.  However, we do 
not have data to substantiate the speculation.  Accordingly, these potential benefits were not considered in the 
analysis.   
     IV- 85 
Summary of Benefits:               
 
When vehicles are fully equipped with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system, a total of 
1,392 fatalities would occur when occupants are ejected through the side window opening areas 
in vehicle crashes.152  Among these fatalities, about 54% are from rollovers not preceded by a 
side impact and the remaining 46% are from side impacts that may or may not result in a 
subsequent rollover.  For the weighted risk of ejection method, the benefit analysis shows that 
when passenger cars and light trucks, including SUVs and minivans, are equipped with the 
hypothetical rollover curtain air bag153, a total of 538 lives would be saved and 414 AIS 3+ 
serious injuries would be prevented, annually.  The majority of the benefits would result from 
preventing occupants from ejection in rollovers crashes (62% of fatalities and 59% of serious 
injuries).  It shows that a relatively small percentage of the benefits would be from protecting 
belted occupants (about 13% of fatalities and 26% of serious injuries), whether they are 
completely or partially ejected, when compared to unbelted occupants.  When the estimated 
benefits are adjusted with the projected rollover bag sales (MY 2011) and the performance of 
current rollover bags, the benefit analysis shows that the ejection mitigation system would save 
402 additional lives and prevent 310 additional serious injuries (MAIS 3-5), annually.  The 
estimated potential and additional benefits are summarized below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
152 In the analysis, we estimated that some fatally injured occupants who were completely ejected in catastrophic 
rollover crashes would not be saved by the hypothetical ejection mitigation system.  These fatalities are not included 
in the 1,392 fatalities.

Discussion:     
1. Advanced glazing: The benefits analysis assumes that all side windows are made out of 
tempered/safety glass and, consequently, advanced/laminated glazing was not considered.  
Although very few vehicles are currently equipped with advanced/laminated glazing for the side 
windows, this technology could be effective in preventing occupants from ejection with and 
without curtain air bags.  Advanced glazing in combination with a side curtain has been found to 
                                                          
155 The fatal and non-fatal benefit numbers were rounded to the nearest integer.  
     IV- 88 
be effective and complementary; glazing may be protective to the curtain and provide retention 
in the event of for late curtain deployments.  Current field and laboratory data suggest that even 
partially shattered advanced glazing would be effective in preventing occupant ejection through 
the potential gaps in certain crashes when rollover curtain air bags are used. 156  For the target 
population of the PRIA, the front row window through which an occupant was ejected was 
closed or fixed prior to the crash 69 percent of the time.  Broader population of occupants 
exposed to rollovers show a higher percentage of window closed or fixed.  When crashes were 
restricted to rollover crashes where an occupant was seated next to the window opening, our 
1997 – 2005 NASS CDS data show that a higher percentage, 86 percent, of front windows are 
closed or fixed prior to a rollover.  For the rear rows, the percentage increases from 86 percent to 
98 percent.157  For all rollover exposed occupants, the front and rear percentages were 88 and 98 
percent, respectively.  The PRIA we assumed that the front row window was closed or fixed 
prior to the crash 69 percent of the time, since this was the value for the target population.   
 
The agency is aware of advanced glazing technologies being developed for vehicle’s side 
windows.  Some of these technologies, such as three-layered s polymer and tempered glass, 
could be used to prevent ejection through the potential gap above the window sill when the 
window is up. Note that unlike curtain air bags, as the glass comes up from the window sill, 
advanced glazing would be stronger near the window sill to withstand the impact load from an 
occupant.   Hypothetically, if the window is up 100% of the time and the advanced glazing 
                                                          
156 As discussed, potential gaps can be formed over the window sill and front lower corner of the window opening. 
157 The crash data show that the second and third row ejection route windows were closed or fixed about 94 and 100 
percent of the time, respectively.  Combining all of the data, the ejection route windows were closed or fixed 72 
percent of the time before the crash.  In addition, when all rollover crashes with adjacent occupants were considered, 
87 percent of the ejections occurred through the previously closed or fixed window opening in rollovers.     
     IV- 89 
prevents partial and complete ejections through the gap,158 the glazing-bag combined system 
would be 95% effective in preventing ejections through the window opening areas, whereas 
rollover bags that are meeting the headform test requirements are about 69% effective in 
preventing ejections through side window without the glazing.159  (If we assume that side 
windows are up 69% of the time before side window ejection, the effectiveness of the curtain 
plus advanced glazing system would be about 87%.)   As shown above, since rollover bags 
would be highly effective in preventing occupants from ejection with and without the advanced 
glazing and a relatively small number of vehicles are equipped with the advanced glazing, the 
exclusion of the advanced glazing from the analysis would not have significant effects on the 
benefit estimate.160 
 
In the analysis, we assumed that vehicle manufacturers can meet the proposed headform 
displacement requirement with curtain air bags.  However, the agency’s test data indicate that 
target location A1 is much more challenging than other impact points in the front widow 
                                                          
158 We do not have data to estimate the effectiveness of advanced glazing.   
159 According to our field data, 16% (595) of all fatalities (3,668) in rollover crashes with no side impact were from 
belted occupants and the other 84% were from unbelted occupants, as shown below:   
Fatalities in Rollover Crashes 
 Restraint Partial Complete Total % of 
Belted 538 57 595 16% 
Unbelted 515 2,558 3,073 84% 
Total     3,668 100% 
In the analysis, we assumed that 5% of occupants who were retained by rollover air bags would be ejected through 
the sunroof.  When adjusted with the real world injury data, the glazing & bag combination would be 95% effective 
if the window is up 100% of the time and the advanced glazing prevents ejection through the potential gaps.  
Whereas, rollover bags without the advanced glazing would be about 69% effective when ejections through the 
sunroof are considered , as shown below:   
 Occupant % of

Belted 16% 71% 11% 
Unbelted 84% 65% 58%

With the 69% window up and the 69% combined containment effectiveness in rollovers, the effectiveness of a bag 
plus advanced glazing system would be 87% (95%x.69windwo-up + 69%x.31windwo-down) = 87%), if the advanced 
glazing prevents ejection through the potential gaps.

opening.  As discussed above, if manufacturers utilize advanced/laminated glazing in the front 
window opening, we expected the containment effectiveness would increase from 69% weighted to 
87%, assuming all ejections through the potential gaps would be prevented by the glazing.  In the 
benefit analysis, we estimated that the overall rollover air bag system would be about 45%weighted 
overall effective in reducing fatal injuries.161  When the 87% improved containment effectiveness 
is used, the overall effectiveness would increase from 45% to 59% (77%sensor x 81%containment w/ 
glazing x 88%Winnick’s = 59% overall system effectiveness, fatal injuries).          
 
The agency’s 2nd row window data in Chapter III are much more limited when compared to the 
1st row window data.  In general, the data indicate that target location B1 is more challenging 
than B4.  The exception to this is the Dodge Durango, which performed well at all 2nd row 
targets.162  The Durango test data show that, unlike the front window opening, currently 
available air bag systems can be used to comply with the displacement requirement when the test 
is conducted in the 2nd row window opening area.  Therefore, we expect that vehicle 
manufacturers may not need to install the advanced glazing in the 2nd row and possibly 3rd row 
window openings.  Note that the Durango is a 3 row vehicle.  One might expect that the 2nd row 
in a 3 row vehicle might perform well due to support from the B and C pillars.  The 3rd row 
window in many vehicles is fixed.  This fixed window might be a natural application of 
advanced glazing in that good edge capture may be achieved and the window is never rolled 
down. 
       
                                                          
161 We estimated that the ejection system would have an overall effectiveness of 48% and 44% for belted and 
unbelted occupants, respectively, in rollover crashes.  The weighted effectiveness would be 45%,  (16%x48%)belted + 
(84%x44%)unbelted = 45%weighted    
162 The Dodge Durango 2nd window data show 76 mm at B1, 86 mm at B2, 91 mm at B3, and 82 mm at B4, when 
tested at 24 km/h with a 1.5 second delay.

 2. Minor (AIS 1-2) injuries prevented by rollover curtain bags in side crashes:   Based on the 
1997-2006 NASS CDS, we determined that on average 74,098 injuries occurred from flying 
glass involving 46,789 occupants in side crashes, annually.  The majority of these injuries were 
to the head or face, and most were rated as AIS 1.  Among the 46,789 injured occupants, 30,015 
had face/head injuries from flying glass.  Among the 30,015 occupants with head/facial injuries, 
11% (3,237) were children under 13 years.  It shows that many occupants injured by flying glass 
received multiple injuries of this type.  The injuries from flying glass in side impacts are shown 
below:

* The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer. 
The NASS crash data showed that side air bags deployed at a median lateral delta-V of 11 mph.  
Thus, we assumed that side curtain air bags would not prevent injuries from flying glass below a 
lateral delta-V of 11 mph.  In addition, as discussed in the FMVSS No. 214 FRIA, we believe 
that side air bags would not be effective when side impacts occur at lateral delta-V’s higher than 
25 mph.  When head/face, arm/hand injuries from flying glass were considered, the crash data 
showed that 49% of the injuries occurred in a lateral delta-V range of 11-25 mph. 
 
     IV- 92 
Regarding curtain air bag effectiveness in preventing injuries from flying glass, an analysis of 
the crash data showed that 2.60% of occupants were injured by flying glass without side curtain 
air bags and 0.32% with curtain air bags.  The 0.32% was based on five sampled injured 
occupants.  Although the differences are statistically significant, the standard errors were very 
large relative to the estimate.   
 
In summary, when the window opening area is fully covered with the ejection mitigation curtain 
air bag, it would substantial reduce minor facial injuries resulting from shattered glazing in side 
crashes.  However, as discussed, the NASS sample size is too small to derive the effectiveness of 
curtain air bags in preventing injuries from flying glass.  The agency plans to re-examine the 
potential benefits when additional data are available.           
     V- 1 
V. TECHNICAL COSTS AND LEADTIME  
 
 
In this chapter, we discuss the cost of different technologies that could be used to comply with 
the linear headform test and estimate the compliance test costs.  There are a variety of potential 
ways for manufacturers to meet the test requirements.  To meet the proposed displacement  
requirement, vehicle manufacturers could utilize several different design approaches, such as a 
one-piece curtain air bag that covers the front and rear window opening areas, a separate window 
curtain air bag for each window opening area or utilizing advanced glazing combined with a 
curtain air bag for movable windows and advanced glazing alone for fixed windows.  Among the 
potential design approaches, we believe the one-piece curtain design would be most cost 
effective in meeting the requirement.  The agency believes that current (one-piece) curtain air 
bags designed for head protection in side impacts will have to be wider, larger and stiffer to meet 
the proposed headform requirements.  In addition to the increase in size, manufacturers would 
need to modify other air bag characteristics, such as operating gas pressure, duration, and 
location of bag tether attachments.  For the analysis, we assumed that vehicle manufacturers 
utilize the one-piece design to comply with the displacement requirement.163             
 
Installing a wider and stiffer curtain air bag on the side roof rail will cause some models to be 
redesigned.  The normal redesign cycle for passenger car models is 4-5 years, while pickup 
trucks and some vans (including SUVs) have longer design cycles of 6-7 years.  The costs to 
                                                          
163 We believe that some vehicle manufacturers would install laminated/advanced glazing along with curtain air bags 
to meet the displacement requirement at removable windows.  As discussed in the benefit chapter, advanced glazing 
in combination with a side curtain has been found to be effective and complementary.  In addition to the retention 
benefit, the glazing can provide other benefits, such as reducing noise in the occupant compartment, increasing theft 
protection, and even reducing harmful rays by blocking a certain spectrum of light.  The agency does not have data 
to quantify these secondary benefits and, as a result, these benefits were not considered in the benefit estimate.  
Rather, the benefits and costs associated with advanced glazing were discussed in the sensitivity analysis chapter in 
this Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA).      
     V- 2 
design a model to install a wider and stiffer window curtain are small if it is done at the time of a 
normal redesign.  We believe, therefore, the most cost-effective way to accomplish the redesign 
task is to allow sufficient leadtime to redesign vehicles during their normal redesign cycle.  Since 
we are providing sufficient leadtime, we have not addressed costs for redesigning models. 
 
A. Current Side Air Bag Technology Costs (in 2007 Dollars)     
We believe that all of the assembly costs of a wider curtain air bag (i.e., wider than curtain air 
bags that are capable of meeting the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole requirements) would remain 
the same.  The only difference would be in the direct material costs for the air bag and possibly 
for the inflator.  Since the materials used for air bags are similar in characteristics regardless of 
air bag types, it would be reasonable to assume that the material cost is only affected by the 
amount of material used in the system.  In addition, based on the previous FMVSS No. 214-head 
air bag cost analysis, we believe that the size of the air bag and the inflator are the most critical 
cost items for the system, as discussed in the following section.    
     
1. Costs Associated with Wider/larger Bag Size.   
Air Bag: In the FMVSS No. 214 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA), we estimated costs 
of curtain air bags that are designed to meet the FMVSS No. 214 oblique pole requirements.  The 
estimated costs were based on two NHTSA contractor teardown studies of side/head air bags.  
Based on the studies, we determined an average cost of $130.87 per vehicle for currently 
available window curtain air bags including inflators and $134.02 for the FMVSS No. 214-
curtain bag.164  The estimated $134.02 is based on the minimum coverage of the window 
                                                          
164 The estimated $134.02 air bag cost is for modifying bags and inflators.  Other costs such as sensors and wiring 
are not included in the $134.02.  The total cost to a vehicle for two current separate thorax side air bags and head 
     V- 3 
opening to meet the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole requirement.  However, it is unlikely that 
vehicle manufacturers design head/side air bags to just cover the pole impact area to comply with 
the proposed requirements.  For example, although we found that a small number of currently 
available head air bags will have to be widened to meet the oblique pole impact test, the majority 
of current curtain air bags are wider than the hypothetical FMVSS No. 214-curtain air bag.  In 
other words, most of currently available wider curtain air bags cover more than the FMVSS No. 
214-minimum coverage area in the window opening.  Therefore, we believe that manufacturers 
would install curtain air bags that are wider than the hypothetical FMVSS No. 214-bag (which 
provides the minimum coverage) to meet the oblique pole requirements.  For the cost estimate, 
therefore, we did not use the estimated FMVSS No. 214-curtain air bag cost (i.e., $134.02 per 
vehicle) for the baseline.  Rather, we will analyze actual costs associated with current side 
curtain air bags that are capable of meeting the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole requirements.  
These costs will be used as a baseline to estimate incremental costs associated with (wider) 
rollover curtain air bags.              
 
A recent oblique pole and MDB tests performed by the agency show that a MY 2004 Honda 
Accord equipped with window curtain bags met the head injury requirement with both 50th 
percentile male and 5th percentile female test dummies.  The HIC36 scores were 567 and 446 for 
the 5th and 50th dummies, respectively.165  The head air bag installed in the Accord has a height 
of 16 inches (41 cm) and a width of 62 inches (157 cm) measured at the bottom.166  The Accord 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
window curtains is estimated to be $234.93 ($63.83 for the thorax bags, $130.87 for the window curtains, $36.67 for 
the sensors and $3.56 to connect to the already existing electronic control module, in 2004 dollars). 
165 In addition, the bag would provide a good head protection in vehicle-to-vehicle side crashes based on the HIC 
scores measured in the NHTSA 214-MDB tests.  The test results from the Accord are shown below: 
 Measurement Pole, 5th  Pole 50th  MDB, front, 5th   MDB, front, 50th  
 HIC     567     446     104      109 
166 The length of the bottom portion of a typical curtain bag is longer than the upper portion. 
     V- 4 
test results, including a high speed video analysis, show that curtain air bags that are similar in 
size and construction would be wide enough to retain the head of a test dummy in the oblique 
and also MDB tests.  In other words, curtain air bags that are similar to the Accord curtain air 
bag would produce HIC scores that are below the required 1,000 with both the 50th percentile 
male and 5th percentile female test dummies, as demonstrated in the Accord oblique pole test.                   
 
According to a report titled “Perform Cost and Weight Analysis, Head Protection Air Bag 
Systems, FMVSS  201,” DOT HS 809 842, a curtain air bag installed in a MY 2003 Toyota 
Camry has a height of about 16 inches and a width of about 61 inches measured at the bottom, 
with a total coverage area of 800 in2 (5,161 cm2).  A visual inspection shows that the Camry and 
the Accord have curtain air bags that are similar in construction and size167.  As discussed, the 
Accord’s oblique pole test results indicate that the curtain installed in the Camry could meet the 
FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole test requirements without widening the air bag.  For the cost 
analysis, we used the Camry curtain bag as a baseline (FMVSS No. 214-curtian bag168) to derive 
the incremental material costs associated with a rollover curtain air bag169.   
 
The side window opening area of a MY 2003 Toyota Camry has a height of 18 inches (46 cm) 
and a width of 39 inches (99 cm) at the top and 75 inches (191 cm) at the bottom (at the widow 
sill), with a total opening area of 1,026 in2 (6,619 cm2).  To fully cover the window opening area, 
therefore, the 214-curtian bag must be widened by 1,458 cm2 (6,619window opening -5,161size of 214-
                                                          
167 The Camry is about 3% larger than the Accord. 
168 Assuming that a final rule would be issued in October 2009, NHTSA proposes that the phase-in would start in 
September 1, 2013.  Accordingly, we expect that the majority of vehicles will be installed with the 214-curtain bag 
before the effective date of the ejection mitigation final rule.      
169 According to a report titled “Perform Cost and Weight Analysis, Head Protection Air Bag Systems, FMVSS

In the teardown study of curtain air bags, DOT HS 809 842, we estimated that material (i.e., 
loomed cloth used for the air bag) costs associated with the Camry curtain bag would be $103.75

bag) end user cost in 2007 economics.171  The unit material cost was estimated to be $0.00327 
per cm2 based on the 5,161 cm2 air bag coverage area and the $16.87 estimated material cost per 
air bag [($16.87 per bag)/5,161 cm2 = $0.00327/cm2].  As discussed previously, the Camry has a 
window opening area of 6,619 cm2.  Thus, the air bag (5,161 cm2) must be widened by 1,458 
cm2 to fully cover the window opening area (6,619 cm2).  With the $0.00327 unit cost (per cm2) 
and the additional coverage area (1,458 cm2), we estimated that material costs associated with 
widening the air bag would be $ 9.53 per vehicle (1,458 cm2 x $0.00327/cm2 = $4.77/curtain, 
$4.77per curtain x 2sides = $9.53 per vehicle in 2007 economics).172   
 
In summary, for the incremental costs associated with the hypothetical rollover air bag, we 
assumed that vehicle manufacturers need to spend $9.53 per vehicle to widen the FMVSS No. 
214-curtain bag to meet the proposed headform displacement requirement (in 2007 costs) at the 
front and second row window openings.  The incremental costs associated with the wider curtain 
air bag (i.e., rollover air bag) are relatively small when compared to the overall system cost.  For 
vehicles equipped with combo air bags that are designed to comply with the FMVSS No. 214-
oblique pole requirements, the costs would be higher since the combo system must be replaced 
with a curtain (rollover air bag) system.  We estimated a cost of $91.14 for the wider FMVSS 
No. 214-combo air bag173 and $183.39 for the hypothetical rollover curtain air bag per vehicle 
(including inflator but without rollover sensor, in 2007 costs).  Therefore, material costs for

consumers, 2007 = 119.816, 2003 = 106.404, the multiplier = 119.816/106.404 = 1.1260, $33.73, ($29.96 x 1.1260 
= $33.73) for two bags per vehicle.  Thus, for each bag, $16.87

172 The teardown study shows that the loomed cloth used for the Toyota curtain bags weighs about 2.59 lbs. per 
vehicle.  The window opening area and the bag coverage indicate that the increase in weight would be insignificant.   
173 In the 214 FRIA, we estimated that two combo bags would be $85.98 (two per vehicle) in 2005 economics.  
When adjusted with implicit GDP price deflator, it results in $91.14. 
     V- 7 
replacing the FMVSS No. 214-comb bag would be about $92.25 ($183.39 - $91.14 = $92.25), 
excluding rollover sensor174, as summarized in Table V-2.    
 
Inflator: A typical inflator consists of an electrical initiator unit, a casing and propellant.  The 
cost teardown study (DOT HS 809 842) shows the cost ranges from $30 to as high as $57 per 
unit.  
(A) Costs associated with electrical initiator: The inflators are designed such that an 
increase in propellant would not require a larger more powerful electrical initiator.  Thus, it is 
reasonable to assume that the same type of initiator would be used for both the FMVSS No. 214-
curtain and larger rollover curtain air bag designs.   
(B) Propellant and casing: Current curtain head air bags are typically designed to provide 
head protections by incorporating gas chambers in the air bag.  To comply with the proposed 
headform displacement requirements in the opening area, the majority of air bag manufacturers 
would not have to incorporate additional gas chambers in the extended air bag area.  However, in 
some cases, vehicle manufacturers may need to enlarge the chambers.  In the cost and weight 
analysis report, we estimated that material costs associated with the inflators installed in a 2003 
Toyota Camry would be about $7.61 in 2003 economics, which was designed to inflate to cover 
the 5,161 cm2 area in the window opening.  If we assume that the ratio between the area covered 
with the chamber and the overall air bag coverage area remain unchanged, the 28% increase in 
coverage area [(6,619-5,161)/5,161(cm2) = 28.25%] would increase the cost by $2.42 ($7.61 x 
0.2825 28% increase x (119.816/106.404)Ratio of implicit GDP price inflator  = $2.42 incremental cost in 2007 
economics). 
                                                          
174 $183.39rollover curtain +$38.02rollover sensor - $91.14 wider combo = $130.28incremental cost.  In addition, for the overall 
incremental costs, we assumed that manufacturers would install thorax bags when combo bags are replaced by 
rollover curtain bags.   
     V- 8 
 
Tether: In the benefit chapter, we determined that some of the tether anchors (to the A- and C-
pillars) need to be strengthen to withstand the loads at the lower impact points, A1 and A2.  In 
addition, the tether may be lowered to provide more window coverage.  Unlike the tethers in a 
curtain bag design, the tethers in a rollover air bag would be designed to provide a sufficient 
tension in the bag to meet the 100 mm displacement requirement.  In some cases, manufacturers 
would shorten the length of the side curtain tethers to provide the required tension (to meet the 
displacement requirement).  Based on the geometry of the opening, therefore, we assumed that 
there are no incremental costs associated with the tethers.   
 
2. Costs Associated with Rollover Sensor           
The electronic components used in a typical curtain bag system consist of several (side) impact 
sensors, wiring harness and a central electronic module.  Unlike side impact sensor systems, 
rollover detection systems do not have satellite sensors or wiring harness.  Instead, rollovers 
sensors are most likely integrated into a central control, which is designed to detect rolls and 
deploy countermeasure(s).  In addition, we anticipate that all light vehicles will be equipped with 
Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system when vehicles are designed to meet the proposed 
ejection mitigation requirements.  ESC is capable of detecting several vehicle inputs that could 
be used in detecting rollovers, such as lateral acceleration and yaw rate.  With ESC, therefore, we 
believe that vehicle manufacturers would utilize these inputs and only need a roll rate sensor as 
an additional component for the rollover mitigation system.  However, as of today, the agency 
has not performed any detailed teardown studies on rollover systems and, as a result, does not 
have refined cost estimates for rollover sensors.  Based on information provided by sensor 
     V- 9 
suppliers and the cost information obtained during agency’s teardown studies on Electronic 
Stability Control system, we estimated that the price of the sensor would be the same as the cost 
estimate used for yaw sensors in the ESC Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA).  
Accordingly, we estimated each rollover sensor would be $38.02 (in 2007 dollars) per vehicle.175   
      
3. Costs Associated with Vehicle Modification: The one-piece curtain system is designed to 
cover the front and rear side window opening areas with a single curtain bag.  The top of the bag 
would be attached to vehicle’s roof line and the sides would be attached to vehicle’s pillars (A-
pillar and either C- or D-pillars in large SUV’s or mini vans).176  Although we expect vehicle 
manufacturers will modify the current air bag designs, any modifications to the structure would 
not be significant, especially if the redesign is done at the time of a normal design cycle.   
 
Estimated Vehicle Costs for Meeting Headform Test        
To determine the number of vehicles with rollover air bags, we obtained information on MY 
2011 vehicle models equipped with rollover air bags from manufacturer’s estimated sales.  The 
combined results of this effort to estimate the percent of sales are shown in Tables V-2 and V-3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
175 The cost of the sensor is $38.02 in 2007 economics and $35.87 in 2005 economics.  The $35.87 average cost is 
based on costs of five vehicle makes/models.  The cost ranges from $22.06 to as high as $50.47 per vehicle.  
176 We note that convertibles will have a different curtain air bag design.  Perhaps, it would be designed to deploy 
from the window sill.

 * We assumed that the remaining 5% (100%-95% = 5%) include other types of air bag systems (such as

The results in Table V-3 show that an estimated 95 percent of the passenger cars and SUVs & 
light trucks will voluntarily be equipped with head air bags in MY 2011 vehicles.  The majority 
of these head air bags will be curtain air bags and 55% of these curtain bags will be equipped 
with rollover sensors.  It is assumed that 100% of vehicles will meet the FMVSS 214 
requirements, and 1% would meet the 214 requirements with a combination bag.   
 
 
 
 
                                                          
177 The “curtain” includes both “curtain + thorax” and “curtain only.”  The ITS may be utilized to meet the 214-
oblique pole requirements.  The percent of the ITS is relatively small (less than 1% for MY 2007 vehicles) and the 
system would not be capable of meeting the headform displacement requirement.  The numbers were rounded to the 
nearest integer.     
     V- 11 
Compliance Rate of Current Rollover Curtain Bags        
The linear headform test results indicate that the majority of current curtain bags (whether they 
are designed as head bags or rollover bags) would not meet the proposed 100 mm deflection 
requirement at all four (4) impact points in the front window opening. 
 
The headform test results showed that some of currently available curtain bags are capable of 
meeting the displacement requirement at impact points A2, A3 and A4.  However, as mentioned, 
none of the air bags met the requirement at all impact points.  For the cost estimate, therefore, we 
assumed that all current curtain air bags will be modified whether they meet the displacement  
requirement at a particular impact point or not.  In addition, when current air bags are redesigned 
to meet the headform displacement requirement in the front widow opening area, we believe that 
manufacturers will design the air bags such that they meet the deflection requirement at both 
front and rear window opening areas.  On the other hand, even if current bags meet the 
displacement requirement in the rear opening area, they must be redesigned since none of the 
current air bags met the displacement requirement at all impact points in the front window 
opening area.  Thus, we did not consider headform impact tests performed in the rear opening 
area since the test results show that all currently available systems need to be redesigned.      
 
Table V-4 shows our range of current technology cost estimates, although these technologies 
may or may not actually go into production.  For this analysis, we estimated the costs based on a 
wider curtain air bag.178  We considered two approaches that vehicle manufacturers may take to 
meet the proposed requirements: (1) modify current curtain head air bags to the one-piece 
                                                          
178 These rollover bags would be wider than the hypothetical 214-curtain bag. 
     V- 12 
rollover curtain air bag179 and (2) replace the FMVSS No. 214-combination bag with the one-
piece rollover curtain air bag and a thorax air bag.  In addition, although the headform test does 
not require manufacturers to install rollover sensors, we believe that manufacturers will provide 
rollover sensors as part of the system.  Accordingly, costs associated with rollover sensors are 
included in the cost estimate, as shown in Table V-4A and V-4B.180

179 For the analysis, we assumed that manufacturers would install thorax bags when vehicles are equipped with 
curtain bags to meet the 214-oblique pole requirements. 
180 The MY 2011 vehicle baseline sales were based on vehicle manufacturers’ projected sales, prior to the issuance 
of the NPRM.  It is possible that the projected percentage of MY 2011 vehicles with ejection mitigation systems 
would increase when the NPRM is issued.    
181 The wide 214-throax bag: $69.08 per vehicle in 2004 economics.  Adjusted with the implicit GDP price inflator, 
$69.08x(119.816/109.462) = $75.61 per vehicle   
182 Some vehicles may need four (4) sensors for side impacts to meet the 214-oblique pole requirements.  However, 
the ejection mitigation rule would not affect the side impact sensors needs.  Therefore, the incremental costs would 
remain the same.    
     V- 13 
 
 
The results in Table V-4 showed that the incremental cost per vehicle would be $31.33, based on 
MY 2011 sales. 
  
Costs Associated with 3rd Row Window Curtain 
Previously, we estimated that vehicle manufacturers need to spend $11.95 ($9.53 for curtain and 
$2.42 for inflator) per vehicle for covering 1st and 2nd row windows.  Accordingly, these costs do 
not include costs associated with covering 3rd row windows.  For the FMVSS No. 214 
rulemaking, vehicle manufacturers provided their projected sales thru MY2011.  The sales data 
show that 25% of MY 2011 light vehicles have a third row seat.  As part of the ejection 
mitigation rulemaking effort, a series of field surveys were performed to determine the size of 
side windows.  Our survey data show that the majority of SUVs and vans, if not all, have 3rd row 
windows.  For example, a MY 2007 Nissan Pathfinder has three row windows (two movable and 
one fixed in the 3rd row).  The third row side window has a height of 46 cm (18 inches) and a 
width of 48 cm (19 inches), a total area of 2,206 cm2.  Previously the air bag material cost was 
estimated to be $0.00327 per cm2 and the inflator cost was estimated to be $0.00166 per cm2 
($8.57/5,161 cm2 = $0.00166 in 2007 economics).  When the 3rd row side window opening is 
covered with a curtain air bag, therefore, it would incur $21.74 incremental cost per vehicle, 
($0.00327air bag cloth + $0.00166inflator) x 2,206 cm2 = $10.87per side, $21.74 per vehicle.  If we 
assume that these light trucks will have two side windows in the 3rd row, the total incremental 
costs associated with the air bag would be about $92 million (17 million vehicles x 25% x $21.74 
= $92.4 million).  Note that, for the estimated $92 million for the 3rd row windows, we assumed 
that all curtain air bags installed in MY 2011 light trucks (including SUVs and minivans) only 
     V- 14 
cover the front and 2nd row window openings.  However, when curtain air bags are installed in 
SUVs and vans to meet the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole requirements, for example, we believe 
that the air bag will be tethered to the A-and D-pillars, rather than being attached the A- and C-
pillars, since the D-pillar would have a higher structural strength and larger space for the anchor 
and tethers, as shown in Figure V-2.      
 
   
Figure V-2. Ejection Mitigation Curtain Air Bag (Canopy) Installed in MY 2004 Mercury 
Monterey Minivan 
  
In other words, when manufacturers install a curtain air bag to meet the FMVSS No. 214-oblique 
pole requirements in the front row of SUVs and vans, the curtain air bag would be anchored to 
the A-and D-pillars and cover not only the front but also the second and third row window 
openings.  Accordingly, for incremental costs over manufacturers’ plans, we assumed that SUVs 
and vans would have a similar cost for both front and rear windows.  Therefore, under the 
voluntary compliance agreement in the second and third rows, we estimated that the total 
incremental costs associated with 3rd row bags would be about $51 million (17 million vehicles x 
25% w/ 3rd row seat x $11.95 = $50.8 million).

183  For the 214-combination baseline system (1.41% of total sales in MY 2011), we assumed that the combination 
system will be replaced with the rollover curtain system.  Accordingly, the costs associated with the 214-
combination system were subtracted from the costs of the rollover curtain system.  
184 For the analysis, we used the 214-bags as a baseline.  As part of the 214 rulemaking effort, the agency determined 
that the majority of vehicles will be equipped with either curtain bag or head-thorax combination (combo) bags.  If 
vehicles are equipped with these bags, the MY 2011 sales data indicate that combo bags would be about 1.3% of the 
total sales (54.59% curtain with a roll sensor, 38.98% curtain without roll sensor, 1.34% combo and 5.10% others).  
The estimated costs are based on assumption that all vehicles are equipped with either curtain or combo bags: 1.4% 
combo weighted and 98.6% curtain weighted (1.4% + 98.6% = 100%).   
     V- 16 
 
The results in Table V-6 show that the total annual net cost for meeting the requirements with a 
curtain air bag with rollover sensors.  We assumed that the projected MY 2011 vehicle market 
share (of different head bag systems) remains unchanged when the costs were adjusted with the 
weighted 2011 vehicle sales, it resulted in $31.33 per vehicle if 1st and 2nd row windows are 
covered with a curtain air bag.186 When the 3rd row windows are covered with a curtain bag, the 
total incremental cost would be $583 million ($532.7M + $50.8M = $583 million, as shown in 
Table V-6).          
 
With estimated 17 million light vehicles and assuming no compliance, the total incremental cost 
for the 1st and 2nd row windows would be $533 ($532.7) million in 2007 dollars.  For the $533 
million incremental cost, we estimated that vehicle manufacturers need to spend $11.95 for 
FMVSS No. 214-curtain bags with rollover sensor and $49.97 for 214-curtain bags without 
rollover sensor for each vehicle.  Although some convertibles could be equipped with head air 
bags that are designed to come upward from the door window sill, the ability of such a design to 
meet the proposed ejection mitigation test is not known.  Agency discussions with convertible 
manufacturers have also indicated that they are exploring the use of advanced glazing.  The 
NPRM requests comments on the feasibility of installing ejection mitigation countermeasures to 
convertibles.  Below we explore the effect on incremental costs of exempting convertibles from 
the requirement.  If this is the case, we believe that the majority of convertibles will be equipped 
with combo air bags when the final rule is issued.  The MY 2011 sales show that 1.3% of 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
185 The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer, $532.7 + $50.8 = $583.4 million.  When all light vehicles (17 
million) are combined, the incremental unit cost would be $34.32 per vehicle.    
186 (55% curtain with roll sensor x $11.95) + (44% curtain without roll sensor x $49.97) + (1% combo bags x 
$208.31) = $31.33 for 1st and 2nd row windows in 2006 economics.

vehicles are convertibles (FMVSS No. 214-vehicles: 54.59% curtain with a roll sensor, 38.98% 
curtain without roll sensor, 1.34% combo and 5.1% others.  Previously, we assumed that vehicles 
that are not currently equipped with head air bags would be equipped with curtain bags (without 
a rollover sensor).  Accordingly, we expect that 44.08% of MY 2011 vehicles would be equipped 
with curtain air bags without a roll sensor.)  If convertibles are exempted, about 0.04% of MY 
2011 vehicle would be equipped with combo air bags (1.34% - 1.3% - 0.04%).187  Therefore, the 
weighted incremental cost would be $28.63 for 16.8 million vehicles (59.59%x$11.95 curtain w/ roll 
sensor + 44.08%x$49.97 curtain w/o roll sensor + 0.04%x$208.31combo= $28.63, 17Mx(1-1.3% = 16.8M 
vehicles)188.  Thus, the total incremental cost without convertibles would be $487 million (17 
million x (1-0.013 % of convertibles) x $28.63 weighted = $486.6 million) for covering 1st and 2nd row 
windows.  Previously, we estimated that the total incremental costs associated with 3rd row air 
bags would be $51 million.  Therefore, if convertibles are excluded from the final rule, the total 
incremental cost would be $537 million to cover all three row windows.189           
 
It should be noted that the costs above do not reflect costs associated with vehicle modifications 
and compliance tests.  Currently, curtain air bags are installed in the roof rail/headliner and are 
anchored to the vehicle structure.  The weight and shape of these systems are specifically 
designed for the roof rail/headliner.  When manufacturers decide to install the system as a 
countermeasure, we believe that the required additional material for the roof rail headliner 
                                                          
187 We assumed that all MY 2011 light vehicles would be equipped with either curtain or combo bags to comply 
with the 214-oblique pole requirements.  In addition, we assumed that all convertibles would be equipped with 
combo air bags.    
188 Additional information, see Table V-6, last column. 
189 When convertibles are excluded from meeting the headform test requirements, the total incremental cost would 
decrease from $583 million to $537 million dollars.  We note that by applying the $11.95 and $49.97 incremental 
costs (estimated for 214-curtains with and without rollover sensors), we are assuming that all non-convertibles are 
equipped with curtain bags (no combo bags).            
     V- 18 
modification on a per-vehicle cost would be insignificant.  Costs associated with vehicle 
compliance tests are discussed below in section C.  
    
B. Other Potential Technology Costs 
Separate air bag for each window opening area:  Although the majority of the manufacturers will 
install one-piece curtain air bags to comply with the linear impactor headform test requirements, 
other technologies could be used to comply with the requirements.  For example, vehicle 
manufacturers may install a separate air bag for each window opening (that is, separate air bags 
to cover multiple window openings) to overcome design difficulties such as potential 
interference with the shoulder belt or large coverage areas in vans with multi-seating rows.  
However, due to limited data, these potential costs were not estimated in the analysis.     
      
Vehicle with advanced glazing installed: We believe that the majority of vehicle manufacturers 
will install window curtain air bags to comply with the proposed impactor headform test 
requirements.  However, although it is not believed to be likely for laminated glazing to be used 
as a standalone system for movable windows to meet the displacement requirement, laminated 
glazing could be installed on certain vehicles, such as passenger vans with a long 3rd row side 
windows, as a supplement to curtain air bags.  These laminated side window glazing would 
provide a reaction surface for the curtain air bag.  The agency is proposing that windows with 
advanced laminated glazing are fully raised and pre-broken prior to the test.  The test results 
showed that the pre-broken glazing in combination with side curtain have been found to be 
     V- 19 
effective and complementary.  In particular, the combination could be effective in meeting the 
displacement requirement at the lower target points, A1 and A2 in the front window openings.190   
 
In a November 1995 report,191 an estimate was made of the cost and weight of side glazing for a 
1995 Ford Taurus.  Existing tempered glass was estimated to cost $8.01 and “trilaminate” glass 
was estimated to cost $32.01 per unit (per side window) as the price to consumers (in 1995 
dollars).  The weight of the two windows was identical at 8.82 lbs.  Trilaminate glass was 
defined as 0.762 mm Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) core sandwiched between two layers of 1.85 mm 
annealed glass.  This is the same glazing being used today in laminate side windows.  The PVB 
is good for energy absorption.  In discussions with glass representatives, it was found that the 
current cost of the glazing is slightly less today (in $2007 dollars) than were estimated in 1995.  
However, the difference in cost between tempered glass and laminate glass is about the same 
today as was developed by our contractors in 1995.  That is, $24 (in 2007 dollars) is about the 
incremental difference in costs for going from a tempered glass to a laminate glass for standard 
size front or rear seat window.  If anything, the incremental cost may decrease slightly with 
increasing sales of laminated glass.      
 
One of the important features for utilizing laminated glass for side window ejection is the extent 
of edge capture around the edge of the glass.  For a front windshield, the laminated glass (similar 
to what will be used for side windows) is bonded to the frame of the window using urethane.  
The urethane bonding is also being used by manufacturers for third seat side windows that are 
                                                          
190 As discussed in the benefit chapter, none of the vehicles met the displacement requirement at A1 whether 
laminated glazing is used or not.  The laminated glazing installed in the vehicles was primarily designed for theft 
protection, not ejection mitigation.  We believe that laminated glazing can be designed for ejection mitigation.

Research Team.

not moveable.  We note that there is no difference in how the laminated glass will be held in the 
door channel, as compared to tempered glass.  It might have to be offset slightly, but no 
difference in costs. 
 
In addition to advanced glazing, some vehicle manufacturers are considering other advanced 
materials, such as polycarbonate, to use for the side openings in the rear.  Based on information 
from suppliers, we believe that the cost for the plastic window is about the same as laminated 
glass but it weighs about half as much.  However, the agency has not performed any evaluation 
on these advanced materials and how they behave in rollovers.  We note that the pre-break test 
procedure was developed based on an assumption that either tempered or laminated glazing will 
be used for the windows.  We do not believe that the current glass breaking procedure would do 
much to the polycarbonate, other than scratch or chip the surface a bit.  On the other hand, the 
procedure could be relevant to a polycarbonate window since the window would not shatter as 
easily as a tempered or laminate glass window in rollovers, so it would be much more likely to 
be in place to help contain an occupant.        
   
C. Compliance Test Costs 
This section discusses the estimated costs for the agency to perform compliance tests or 
potentially for a manufacturer to perform certification tests.  Costs are in 2007 dollars. 
 
The proposed linear guided headform impact test is similar to the 201-head form test specified in 
FMVSS No. 201 “Occupant Protection in Interior Impact.”  The 201-headform test is designed to 
provide occupant protection in interior impacts by impacting a 6.8 kg, 165 mm diameter 
     V- 21 
headform at a relative velocity of 24 km/h.  Unlike the proposed linear headform test, the 201-
headform test is not guided test.  Since the 201-headform test is already run by vehicle 
manufacturers, tests like the 201-headform may not be incremental costs for them.  In other 
words, the difference between these two headform tests would be insignificant in terms of 
compliance test costs. 
 
The labor cost of running a head form test (either the FMVSS No. 201 free motion or the 
proposed guided) is around $100 (not including the cost of the vehicle).  The number of 
proposed test ranges from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 24, depending upon the number of 
window openings.192  The average cost of a vehicle is $28,000.  For each vehicle, we estimated 
that the testing costs are $300 for the air bag, $400 for the laminated glazing and $100 for 
labor/engineering.  Thus the average cost for running a proposed headform test is less than one 
dollar per vehicle.193   
 
The vehicle cost estimates for NHTSA may not reflect the vehicle cost estimates for 
manufacturers.  While the average new vehicle price is around $30,000, manufacturers 
developing all new models may decide to use a few prototype vehicles for development testing 
                                                          
192 Assumptions used for the weighted test cost are shown below: 
217 make/models, 16.9 million annual vehicle production, 78,000 average annual make/model production 
(16.9M/217 = 78,000), 5 year production cycle, air bag cost = $300, laminated glazing cost = $400, labor per test = 
$100, for 16 tests, the cost would be $12,800, vehicle cost $28,000, the total cost would be $40,800.  40,800/78,000 
= $0.52/veh/ design cycle, $0.52/5 = $.10 per/vehicle.  
193 The number of actual head form tests performed in a vehicle depends on the number of window openings.  For 
two door passenger cars or light trucks, a total of eight (8) tests are likely required, although vehicle with small 
windows could require fewer.  For large minivan or SUVs with three separate window openings for each side, a total 
of 24 tests are required.  On average, we estimate a total of 16 tests per vehicle.  The estimation is based on an 
assumption that all passenger vehicles (under 10,000 GVWR) have two medium or large side window openings for 
each side.  However, we expect that about 50% of the fleet will be light trucks, including SUVs and mini vans.  In 
general, SUVs and minivans have more than two side windows in each side.  Therefore, the estimated 16 test per 
vehicle would somewhat underestimate the required number of tests (per vehicle).  However, the increase in cost 
would be relatively small.  If we assume that 50% of light vehicles have four side windows and the remaining 
vehicles have six side windows, the test cost would be about $.11per vehicle, with less than one cent difference.  
     V- 22 
purposes.  Although a prototype vehicle can cost much more than a production vehicle, a 
developmental vehicle for the proposed test requirements would be less than the production 
vehicle since incomplete vehicles could be used for the curtain air bag installation and the head 
form test.              
           
D. Leadtime 
The longest design issue, in terms of time, is installing a window curtain (which would be wider 
than the FMVSS No. 214-curtain) on the side roof rail.  This is most easily accomplished when 
the model is being redesigned.  Most passenger car models are redesigned in about a four years 
period, while pickup trucks and some vans have longer redesign cycles of about 7 years.  
NHTSA believes the most cost-effective way to accomplish this redesign task is to allow a 
phase-in of the requirements.  This accomplishes two objects.  First, the new makes and models 
can be designed with the new requirements efficiently.  Second, all of the make/models don’t 
have to be redesigned at one time.  The agency is proposing to phase-in the new ejection 
mitigation requirements starting the first September 1 three years from the date of publication of 
a final rule.   Assuming that a final rule would be issued in after September 1, 2009, NHTSA 
proposes that the phase-in would be implemented in accordance with the following schedule: 
September 1, 2013 for 20 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles, 
September 1, 2014 for 40 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles, 
September 1, 2015 for 75 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles, and  
September 1, 2016 for all light vehicles. 
Advanced credits earned prior to the phase-in would be allowed during the phase-in period.  
 
     V- 23 
E. Summary of Costs and Lead-time: 
We believe that the ejection mitigation rulemaking generally poses no design conflicts for 
vehicles and presents relatively few synchronization issues and could comfortably follow the 214 
rulemaking without significant redesign problems.  We believe that the design changes will 
primarily involve component level modification by suppliers rather than vehicle structural 
modification.  In reality, we expect that vehicle manufacturers will design a system one time to 
meet both the 214 and head form test requirements.  We expect that cost savings resulting from 
the “one time” design would not be substantial with respect to the total cost.194  The estimated 
incremental costs in 2007 economics are shown below:

194  The costs in 2007 dollars were achieved by applying the implicit gross domestic (GDP) price deflector to the 
2005 economics: 113.034 in 2005, 119.816 in 2007, the ratio = 1.06.  
195 Agency’s linear headform test results show that none of the bags tested met the deflection requirement when 
tested at all impact points.  Thus, we believe that all currently available bags need be redesigned to be in compliance 
with the proposed requirements.  
196 When all light vehicles are equipped with head air bags to meet the 214-oblique pole requirements, we assumed 
that vehicles without any head air bags would be equipped with 214-curtain bags (without rollover sensors) to 
comply with the 214-oblique pole requirements.  As a result, the percentage of curtain without rollover sensors 
would increase from 38.98% to 44.08%.  
197 As discussed, the total incremental cost would decrease from $583M to $537M if convertibles are excluded from 
meeting the headform deflection requirement.

VI. COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND BENEFIT-COST ANALYSES 
A. Cost –Effectiveness Analysis  
The intent of the rulemaking is to minimize deaths and injuries by preventing occupants from 
side window ejection in motor vehicle crashes.  To achieve this goal, NHTSA is requiring a 
linear impactor headform test, to ensure that occupants are provided whole body protection by 
mitigating partial and complete ejections in crash environments.  In previous chapters, a 
countermeasure system based on curtain air bag technologies was examined for costs and 
benefits.  
   
As a primary measure of the effect of the linear headform test, this analysis will measure the cost 
per equivalent life saved.  In order to calculate a cost per equivalent fatality, nonfatal injuries 
must be expressed in terms of fatalities.  This is done by comparing the value of preventing 
nonfatal injuries to the value of preventing a fatality.  Comprehensive values, which include both 
economic impacts and lost quality (or value) of life considerations will be used to determine the 
relative value of fatalities and nonfatal injuries.  These values were taken from the most recent 
study by NHTSA.  In Table VI-1, the process of converting nonfatal injuries to its fatal 
equivalent is shown.198  The third column of Table VI-1 shows the comprehensive values used 
for each injury severity level, as well as the relative incident-based weights for nonfatal serious 
injuries, AIS 3-5.   
 
                                                          
198 In valuing reductions in premature fatalities, we used a value of $5.8 million per statistical life and $6.1 million 
comprehensive cost.  The $5.8 million statistical life is based on the most recent DOT guidance, Revised 
Departmental Guidance, treatment of Value of Preventing Fatalities and Injuries in Preparing Economic Analysis,” 
Memorandum from D. J. Gribbin, General Counsel and Tyler D. Duval, Assistant Secretary for Transportation 
Policy, February 5, 2008.

In Chapter IV, ejection mitigation benefits were derived for the curtain air bag countermeasure, 
as shown in Table VI-1.

The results in Table VI-1 show that the curtain ejection mitigation air bag would save 455 
equivalent fatalities.  
    
In Table VI-2, the safety benefits from Table VI-1 have been discounted at 3% and 7% rates to 
express their present value over the lifetime of one model year's production.  Although passenger 
cars and light trucks have different adjustment factors at a given percent discount rate, the 
average of these adjustment factors was used for the discount based on the assumption that future 
sales will be approximately 50 percent passenger cars and 50 percent light trucks.  The discount 
factors and the discounted fatal equivalents are summarized in Table VI-2. 
Table VI-2 
Present Discounted Value of Lives Saved  
Fatal Equivalent Discount Rate Discounted Fatal Equivalent  
455 0.8155 at 3% 371 
455 0.6489 at 7% 295 
 
The discounted fatal equivalents in Table VI-2 show that curtain ejection mitigation curtain air 
bags would save 371 and 295 equivalent lives when discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively.   
    VI- 3
   
The total annual costs199 from Table V-8 for vehicles with ejection mitigation air bags were 
divided by the discounted fatal equivalent from Table VI-2 to produce estimates of the cost per 
equivalent life saved, as shown in Table VI-3.

The results in Table VI-3 show that the cost per equivalent life saved for the curtain ejection 
mitigation air bag system ranges from $1.6 million to $2.0 million at 3% and 7% discount rates, 
respectively.   
         
B.  Benefit-Cost Analysis 
 
Effective January 1, 2004, OMB Circular A-4 requires that analyses performed in support of 
rules must include both cost effectiveness and benefit-cost analysis.  Benefit-cost analysis differs 
from cost effectiveness analysis in that it requires that benefits be assigned a monetary value, and 
that this value be compared to the monetary value of costs to derive a net benefit.  In valuing 
                                                          
199 Previously, we estimated a total incremental cost of 583 million when the expected bag sales remain unchanged.  
See the cost chapter for additional discussion. 
200 In the benefit analysis, we used an array of 214-side bags to estimate increased costs for the ejection mitigation 
system because we could not accurately predict the precise methods that vehicle manufacturers would use to 
upgrade the 214 side air bag systems to meet the headform displacement requirement.  However, if the market share 
of different types of head bags in MY 2011 vehicles remains unchanged, we could estimate costs associated with the 
probable outcome of rollover bags under the proposed rule.  The sales data indicate that 58%, 41% and 1% of side 
bags are curtain with rollover sensors, curtain without rollover sensor and finally combo bags, respectively.   
    VI- 4
reductions in premature fatalities, we used a value of $5.8 million per statistical life (in 2007 
economics).201   
 
When accounting for the benefits of safety measures, cost savings not included in value of life 
measurements must also be accounted for.  Value of life measurements inherently include a 
value for lost quality of life plus a valuation of lost material consumption that is represented by 
measuring consumer’s after-tax lost productivity.  In addition to these factors, preventing a 
motor vehicle fatality will reduce costs for medical care, emergency services, insurance 
administrative costs, workplace costs, and legal costs.  If the countermeasure is one that also 
prevents a crash from occurring, property damage and travel delay would be prevented as well.  
The sum of both value of life and economic cost impacts is referred to as the comprehensive cost 
savings from reducing fatalities.  
    
The countermeasures that result from FMVSS No. 226, “Ejection mitigation” affect vehicle 
crashworthiness and thus do not involve property damage or travel delay.  The agency is 
conducting a study to establish the comprehensive cost saving from preventing a fatality for 
crashworthiness countermeasures.  The preliminary results indicate that the comprehensive cost 
would be $6.1 million per life in 2007 economics.  The $6.1 million comprehensive cost saving 
was used for the benefit-cost analysis.  The costs used to derive the $6.1 million comprehensive 
cost saving and the relative value factors reflecting $5.8 million statistical life are shown in 
Appendix F.

Secretary for Transportation Policy, February 5, 2008.

Total benefits are derived by multiplying the value of life by the equivalent lives saved.  The net 
benefits are derived by subtracting total costs from the total benefits, as shown in Table VI-4.

The results in Table VI-4 show that ejection mitigation air bags would result in net benefits of 
$1,680 million and $1,217 million at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively.202

equipped with a same (baseline) air bag type.  Nat benefits ($M) at 7%: (a) curtain w/ rollover sensor: $1,598 with 
$203M cost; (b) curtain but no rollover sensor: $951 with $850M cost; (c) combo without rollover sensor: -$1,278 
with $3,541M cost.

VII. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
 
A. Introduction          
This section discusses the change in costs and benefits that result from different assumptions 
used in the analysis.  When inputs that affect the analysis are uncertain, the agency makes its best 
judgment about the probable values or range of values that will occur.  This analysis will 
examine alternatives to these selections to illustrate how sensitive the results are to the values 
initially selected.   
 
The factors that will be examined include: (1) the cost and (2) effectiveness of rollover sensors, 
(3) the use of laminated glazing including laminated glazing in the roof, (4) ejection through the 
second and third row window openings, (5) excluding A1 from the test requirements, (6) 100% 
belt use rate, and (7) crashes involving alcohol. 
 
B. Sensitivity Factors 
(1) Cost of rollover sensor. In the cost chapter, we estimated that each vehicle needs one rollover 
sensor at an average cost of $38.02 (in 2007 economics).  The average cost is based on NHTSA 
contractor teardown studies of five vehicle makes/models.  The rollover sensor cost ranged from 
$23.38 to $53.50 per vehicle (in 2007 economics).  The unit costs of these sensors are 
significantly different among different models and manufacturers.  If the $53.50 sensor cost is 
used, the cost for each ejection mitigation system would increase greatly, as shown below: 
   VII- 2
 
Table VII-1 
Costs for Air Bag System203 with $53.50 Rollover Sensor (in 2007 dollars) 
Baseline 214-Air Bag System Estimated Sales Average Incremental Cost Per Vehicle 
Curtain with Roll Sensor 55% $11.95 
Curtain without Roll Sensor 44% $65.45 
Combo 1% $223.79 
 
With the $53.50 sensor cost (in 2007 dollars), the weighted total incremental cost would be $703 
million ($652 1st and 2nd rows w/ $53.50 sensor + $50.8 3rd row curtain = $703) and the cost per equivalent life 
saved would increase to $2.5 million (with 7% discount and $2.0 million at 3%). When the 
$23.38 (lower end) was used, it would result in a weighted total incremental cost of $470 million 
($419 1st and 2nd rows w/ $23.38 sensor + $50.8 3rd row curtain = $470 million, $1.7 million per equivalent life 
saved at 7% discount and $1.3 million at 3%).        
     
(2)  Effectiveness of rollover sensor. In the benefits chapter, we assumed that each vehicle will 
be provided with a rollover sensor as an integral part of the system.  Although the agency has not 
done any independent research to estimate the effectiveness of rollover sensors, we believe that it 
would be more difficult for the sensor to detect low-energy rolls that would result in a low 
number of quarter-turns in lateral rollovers.  Accordingly, we assumed that rollover sensors are 
not effective in quarter-turn rolls.  However, some sensor suppliers estimate that their sensors 
will work in between 90% and 95% of rollovers, which is much higher than the 77% 
effectiveness rate used in our analysis.  If the claim is indeed true, the assumption used for the 
                                                          
203 A combination bag is designed to protect both head and thorax of an occupant in side crashes.  When a 
combination bag is replaced by a curtain system, we assumed that the vehicle will be equipped with two curtain and 
two thorax bags.  $53.50 roll sensor + $183.39 roll curtain bag + $2.42 incr. inflator - $91.14 combo + $75.61 thorax = $223.79.

sensor effectiveness would underestimate the sensor effectiveness by 7% - 12% for non-fatal 
serious injuries (AIS 3-5) and 14% - 19% for fatal injuries204, as shown below:

When the 90% (supplier estimated) sensor effectiveness rate is used, the overall system 
effectiveness increases from 48% and 44% to about 56% and 52% for belted and unbelted 
occupants, respectively, in rollovers.  With the use of the 90% effectiveness rate, the number of 
overall additional lives saved would increase from 402 to 449 lives, annually.  For the 95% 
sensor effectiveness rate, the number of overall additional lives saved increases from 402 to 468 
lives, annually, as shown in Table VII-3 and also Appendix E.

(3) Use of laminated glazing:      
In the benefit analysis, we assumed that all side windows are made of tempered/safety glass and, 
consequently, advanced/laminated glazing was not considered.  However, the agency’s test data 
indicate target location A1 (see Figure III-6) is much more challenging than other impact points 
in the front window opening.  Current field and laboratory data suggest that even partially 
                                                          
204 The numbers were rounded to the nearest integer. 
205 For the fatal benefits in the table, we assumed that all side windows would be made out of tempered glass.  
   VII- 4
shattered advanced glazing could be effective in preventing occupant ejection through the 
potential gaps in certain crashes when rollover curtain bags are used.206   
 
(3.1) Benefits: As discussed in the benefit chapter, if manufacturers utilize advanced/laminated 
glazing in the front window opening as a supplement to air bag curtains, we expected the 
containment effectiveness would increase from 71% to 88% for belted and 65% to 86% for 
unbelted (weighted with the 69% window-up percentage)207, assuming all ejections through the 
potential gaps would be prevented by the glazing.208  The use of laminated glazing would 
moderately increase the overall system effectiveness.  For example, in the benefit analysis, we 
estimated that the overall rollover air bag system would be about 48% effective in reducing 
belted partial fatal injuries in rollover crashes.  When the 88% improved containment 
effectiveness is used, the overall effectiveness would increase from 48% to 59% (77%sensor x 
88%containment x 88%Winnick’s = 59%) for belted, assuming side windows are up 69% of the time 
before side window ejection.  With the 59%with glazing system effectiveness for belted and 58% for 
unbelted, we expect the number of additional lives saved would increase from 248 to 322 (lives) 
                                                          
206 Although we do not have laboratory or real world crash data, we suspect that advanced glazing may have a 
limited effectiveness in preventing occupants from partial or complete ejection in vehicle-to-pole/tree side crashes.   
207 The agency’s 1997-2005 NASS CDS data showed that, for the target population of the proposed rule, the front 
row window through which an occupant was ejected was closed or fixed prior to the crash 69 percent of the time.  
As discussed in the benefit chapter, we assumed that advanced glazing would contain 95% of ejections through the 
window opening (with the 5% ejection through the sunroof) when the window is up (69%).  When the window is 
down (31%), we assumed that the containment effectiveness values are the same as values derived for the full-
curtain bag.    
208 With the 5% sunroof ejection rate, we estimated that the curtain+glazing system would be 95% effective in 
preventing occupant ejection.  Previously, we estimated that the curtain system would be 71% and 65% effective for 
belted and unbelted occupant, respectively, in rollovers.  These containment rates were adjusted with the 69% 
window-up rate to derive the 92% combined effectiveness (95% x %69%window up + 71% x (100%-69%)window down = 
88% for belted, 95% x 69% + 65% x (100%-69%) = 86% for unbelted.  The weighted combined containment 
effectiveness would be 86%: 16.5% were belted and 83.5% were unbelted in fatal rollovers.  16.5% x .88 + 83.5% x 
.86 = 86%.       
   VII- 5
in rollover crashes.  With the glazing, the overall number of additional lives saved in rollover and 
side crashes would increase from 402 to 494 (lives)209.                    
   
The agency’s test data on the 2nd window are much more limited when compared to the 1st 
window data.  There were only two vehicles, MY 2005 Honda Odyssey and MY 2006 Dodge 
Durango, that were tested for the 2nd window.   
Table VIII-4 
Headform Impact Test for 2nd Window, lower and upper impact points, 24 km/h 
Lower impact area A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 
Honda Odyssey No cover 119 71 152 58* No data 
Dodge Durango 174 156 76 86 66* No data

Honda Odyssey 107 No data 80 193 175 To stops 
Dodge Durango 140* 54 91 82 No data 283 
* At 20 km/h 
 
In general, the data indicate target location B1 is more challenging than B4.  The exception to 
this is the three-row Dodge Durango, which performed well at all 2nd row targets.   When the 
displacement data for the lower impact areas of target A2 and B1 were compared, it showed a 
substantial decrease in displacement, from 119 mm (failed) to 71 mm for the Odyssey and from 
156 mm (failed) to 76 for Durango.  The test results suggested that the B-pillar would provide a 
load bearing area (such as advanced glazing would) for the 2nd row.  Although the 2nd row data 
were from three-row vehicles, the test data show that, unlike the front window opening, currently 
available air bag systems could be used to comply with the displacement requirement when the 
test is conducted in the 2nd row window opening area.210   
 
                                                          
209 In the benefit chapter, we used both “weighted risk” and “uniform risk” approaches for the containment 
effectiveness.  The fatal benefits are based on the “weighted risk” method.   
210 The Durango test data indicated that manufacturers may not need to install laminated glazing combined with air 
bags in the 2nd window opening.  Accordingly, we do not expect that laminated glazing will be used in the 2nd row 
opening.  
   VII- 6
Real world crash data show that a sizable number of occupants were ejected through the sunroof.  
Based on currently available data, we believe that laminated glazing may be useful as a 
countermeasure to prevent occupants from ejection through the sunroof.  At this time, however, 
we do not know whether manufacturers would utilize laminated glazing for the sunroof for their 
vehicles, although current retention technologies indicate that laminated glazing may be feasible.  
In addition, the agency has not developed any test procedures to evaluate sunroof glazing 
performance in rollovers.  Accordingly, we do not have a specific method to estimate potential 
benefits of using laminated glazing for the sunroof.   
 
If we assume that the sunroof glazing is as effective in containing occupants211 as the advanced 
side window glazing (as discussed in this chapter) and that the sunroof has the same 86% 
window-up (i.e., closed-window) percentage as front windows in rollovers,212 the containment 
effectiveness would be about 86% (100%containment thru sunroof x 86%closed sunroof = 86%containment 
effectiveness) for the target population.213  Under the assumption, the laminated sunroof would be 
about 58% effective in reducing a fatality (86%containmnet effectiveness x 77%sensor effectiveness x 
88%Winnicki’s risk = 58%).  Previously, we estimated a total of 737 fatalities in the rollover target 
population (excluding fatalities from catastrophic crashes).  With the 5% ejection rate, the 
laminated sunroof glazing would save about 21 additional lives, annually, in rollover crashes 
[(112belted partial + 107unbelted partial + 519unbelted complete) x 5% = 37occupants ejected through the sunroof.  
                                                          
211 In the benefit chapter, we used two methods to derive the containment effectiveness.  We note that these methods 
are not based on occupant injury levels but the likelihood of ejection through a particular area in the window 
opening.      
212 The agency’s 1997-2005 NASS CDS data showed that 86 percent of front window were closed (or fixed) prior to 
a rollover. 
213 As discussed, some rollover crashes were excluded from the target population.  In addition, we do not have data 
to show whether the sunroof can contain all ejected occupants (i.e., 100%) when it is in closed-position in roll 
crashes.  Therefore, we believe that the actual rate would be lower than the estimated 86% containment rate.                
   VII- 7
37occupants x 58% sunroof ejection effectiveness = 21lives].214  However, we do not know the number of 
vehicles currently equipped with laminated sunroof glazing (or will be equipped in MY 2011).  
As a result, we are unable to estimate what percentage of the 21 fatal benefits would result in 
additional benefits (i.e., adjusted with the installation rate in MY 2011).                      
 
(3.2) Costs: In the cost chapter, we estimated that if vehicle manufacturers replace a tempered 
glass with a laminated glass for standard size front window or rear seat window, the associated 
unit cost would be about $24 (in 2007 dollars).  We expect that the incremental cost may 
decrease slightly with increasing sales of laminated glass.  If all light vehicles are equipped with 
laminated glazing in the front window, the expected incremental total cost associated with the 
glazing would be about $816 million (17 million No. of vehicles x $24incremental unit cost x 2No. of windows = 
$816 million).  The agency expects that about 40% of all light vehicles would have fixed (non-
removable) windows in the rear passenger (i.e., 3rd row) or cargo compartment.215  If both the 
front and the 3rd row windows are equipped with laminated glazing, the total incremental cost 
would be more than one billion dollars ($352M Curtain + $1,142M Advanced glazing = $1,494M.  See 
Chapter VIII for detailed cost analysis on the partial curtain that could be used with laminated 
glazing).216 
                                                          
214 In the rollover target population, there are 12 belted-complete fatalities.  As discussed, we excluded these 
fatalities from the benefit analysis.   
215 Six manufacturers (comprising 87 percent of light vehicles sales) responded confidentially to a NHTSA request 
for planned side air bag installation and projected sales through model year (MY) 2011.  According to the sales data, 
25% of MY 2011 light vehicles have a third seat.         
216 Since 100% of vehicles have 1st row windows and 40% of vehicles have a 3rd row seat or rear cargo bay with side 
windows, the total cost would  be $1,142 million, as shown below: 
   Unit cost No. of veh. No./veh.  % of total Cost 
1st row  $24  17M  2  100%  $816M 
3rd row $24  17M  2  40%  $326M  Total: $1,142M 
The $1,142M is based on an assumption that laminated glazing would be installed in the rear window opening (i.e., 
windows behind the 2nd row).  According to the sales data, 25% of MY 2011 light vehicles have a third row seat.  If 
we assume that laminated glazing would be installed only in the 3rd row seat (not for cargo bay), the cost would be 
$1,020M.  In addition, in Chapter VIII, we estimated that manufacturers need a total incremental cost of $352M to 
   VII- 8
      
(3.3) Cost per Equivalent life Saved: With the glazing, the number of additional lives saved in 
rollover and side crashes would increase from 402 to 494 (lives) over and above window 
curtains, assuming the headform requirement at the A1 cannot be met with a window curtain.  
Similar to the method used for the fatalities, we estimated that a total of 391 AIS 3-5 injuries 
would be saved (39+103+249 = 391), as shown in Table VII-5.

The results in Table VII-4 show that the curtain+glazing ejection mitigation system would save 
560 equivalent fatalities.  
  
The discount factors and the discounted fatal equivalents are summarized in Table VII-6. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
convert the 214-bag system to meet the single-impact headform requirement, by adding rollover sensors to the 214-
curtain and converting the 214-combo bag.  We used the $352M as a baseline for the incremental cost for the partial 
curtain (see Table VIII-4).      
217 For the analysis, we assumed that the window openings are covered with a partial curtain (i.e., excluding A1) for 
the curtain + glazing system.   
A total of 391 additional AIS 3-5 injuries would be prevented by the “curtain + glazing” ejection mitigation system 
(see Appendix E for details), whereas 310 AIS 3-5 injuries were prevented by the curtain (only) system (i.e., “full 
curtain”).  Among the 310 injuries prevented, 63.6%, 26.2% and 10.2 % were from AIS 3, AIS 4 and AIS 5, 
respectively.  These percentages were applied to the 391 injuries prevented with the “curtain + glazing” system, 
resulting 249 AIS 3, 103 AIS 4 and 39 AIS 5 injuries.  
218 In valuing reductions in premature fatalities, we used a value of $5.8 million per statistical life based on the most 
current DOT guidance on valuing fatalities. The relative value factors (i.e., conversion factors in the table) are 
reflecting the $5.8 million value of a statistical life (VSL).  Additional discussion is found in the Cost Effectiveness 
& Benefit-Cost Analysis chapter.

The discounted fatal equivalents in Table VII-5 show that curtain + glazing system would save 
457 and 363 equivalent lives when discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively.   
   
Previously we estimated that a total incremental cost of $352 million for covering 1st, 2nd and 3rd 
row window openings with a partial curtain.  With the $1,142 million glazing cost, the total 
incremental cost increase from $583 million to $1,494 million ($352M + $1,142M = $1,494M, ).  
The $1,494 million total annual cost was divided by the discounted fatal equivalent from Table 
VII-5 to produce estimates of the cost per equivalent life saved, as shown in Table VII-7.

system ranges from $3.3 million to $4.1 million at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively.  
      
(4) Ejections through the 2nd and 3rd row window openings (with uniform distribution): In the 
target population, there are 4,041 side window ejection fatalities in rollover crashes.  Among the 
4,041 fatalities, 3,383 (84%) were from the first row, 620 (15%) were from the second and the 
remaining 38 (1%) were from the third row window, as shown in Table VII-8.

For the remaining two sub-groups in the target population, “side impacts without rollovers in a 
delta-V of 12-25 mph” and “side impacts without rollovers for children 0-12 years in a delta-V 
of 12-25 mph”, we estimated that a total of 42 fatalities would be from the 2nd and 3rd row 
window opening ejections, as shown in Table VII-8.

(4.1) Reduction in Benefit: In the benefit chapter, we determined the risk of ejection through a 
particular area in the side window opening.  The determination was based on test dummies in the 
front seating row in rollover crashes.  Due to limited data, we assumed that all ejections in the 
target population occurred through the first row window opening.  As mentioned, we do not 
know the risk of ejection at a given area in the second and third row window openings.  If we 
assume that the risk of ejection is evenly distributed in the 2nd and 3rd row window opening areas, 
as discussed in the benefit chapter, the risk of ejection through the potential gap would be 33%, 
   VII- 11
as shown in Figure VII-1.   
                   
Figure VII-1. Potential Gap in 1st, 2nd and 3rd Row Window Openings 
In other words, with the 5% ejection rate through the sunroof, a rollover curtain air bag would be 
about 63% effective in preventing occupant ejections (100% -33% = 67% (66.67%).  67% x (1-
0.05) = 63%) in the 2nd and 3rd row side windows.  With the 77% sensor effectiveness and 88% 
Winnick’s survival rate, we estimated that a curtain ejection mitigation system would be 43% 
effective in reducing fatalities for occupants who are ejected through the 2nd and 3rd row side 
window openings in rollover crashes.  For the side crashes followed by rollovers, we estimated 
that the overall system effectiveness would be about 24% for partially ejected and 20% for 
completely ejected occupants (as shown in Appendix E).  With these system effectiveness rates, 
we estimated that a rollover curtain air bag system would save 51 incremental lives for occupants 
ejected through the 2nd and 3rd row side window openings, as shown below:220 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
220 For the potential benefits, we assumed that advanced glazing is equally effective for all rollovers including ones 
with preceding side impacts.   For side impacts without rollovers in the target population, we assumed that advanced 
glazing would not be effective since some of the side impact include vehicle-to-narrow object (such as tree or pole).

For the side impacts, we estimated that a rollover curtain air bag system would save 9

In summary, previously we estimated that a rollover ejection system would save 402 incremental 
(additional) lives, annually.  Among the 402 incremental fatal benefits, 337 (84% of the window 
ejections were from the 1st row, 402lives x 84% 1st row = 337 lives, see discussion above) would be 
from occupants who were ejected through the first row side windows.222  For the remaining 65 
lives saved (402 – 337 first row = 65), we assumed that the risk of ejection through a particular area 
in the 2nd and 3rd row window openings is same as the risk of ejection through a certain area in 
                                                          
221 For example, in Table VII-7, 515 fatalities were from the 2nd row ejections and 38 were from the 3rd row ejections 
in rollovers without side impacts, a total of 553 ejections through the 2nd and 3rd row window openings. 
222 In the target population, we estimated that 3,383 fatalities out of the total 4,041 fatalities in rollover (whether 
with and without side impacts) were from the first row window opening ejection, 3,383/4,041 = 84% of the total 
window opening ejections (see Table VII-8).  In addition, it showed that 15% and 1% of the ejections were through 
the 2nd and the 3rd row windows.  See Tables IV-5, -6 and -7 for additional information. 
 
   VII- 13
the front window opening.  However, we do not have test or real world crash data to estimate the 
risk of ejection through a particular area in the 2nd and 3rd row windows.  When we used the most 
conservative method (i.e., assuming ejections are evenly distributed in the 2nd and also 3rd row 
window openings), it showed that at least 60 lives (51+9 = 60) can be saved when the rear 
window openings are completely covered.  In other words, when the 2nd and 3rd row windows are 
considered separately, it would result in 397 incremental lives saved (337 lives from the 1st row 
and 60 from the 2nd and 3rd rows).  (Mathematically we could estimate that 58 lives saved would 
be through the 2nd row windows and 3 lives saved would be through the 3rd row windows.)  
Without a curtain air bag, the rollover test data show that unbelted occupants can move around in 
a lateral roll and find open portals to be ejected through.  However, we don’t know how unbelted 
dummies or vehicle occupants in the rear seating rows behave in a lateral roll.  If the 3rd row 
window openings are not covered by a window curtain in crashes, due to their relatively large 
window sizes, when compared to the 2nd and 1st row windows,  and the proximity of the 2nd and 
3rd row windows, there may be many more than 3 fatalities being ejected out the 3rd row window 
openings.             
 
(4.2) Increase in Cost: As discussed in the cost chapter, when the 3rd row side window opening is 
covered with a curtain air bag, it would incur $11.95 incremental cost per vehicle.  As part of the 
FMVSS 214 rulemaking, vehicle manufacturers provided their projected sales.  According to the 
sales data, 25% of MY 2011 light vehicles have a third row seat.  If we assume that these SUVs 
and Vans will have two side windows in the 3rd row, the total incremental costs associated with 
the air bag would be about $51 million (17 million vehicles x 25% x $11.95 = $50.8 million).

In summary, when the 2nd and 3rd row window openings are covered with a rollover curtain air 
bag, it would result in 60 lives saved, annually.  Mathematically we could estimate that 3 lives 
saved would be through the 3rd row window openings.  However, the total incremental cost to 
cover the 3rd row windows would be relatively high.  The total incremental cost was estimated to 
be $51 million.                    
 
(5)  Excluding A1 from the test requirements: In the benefits chapter, the potential benefits were 
estimated based on an assumption that vehicle manufacturers would meet the requirements at the 
A1 impact point.  Although the headform test results used in the PRIA showed that none of the 
vehicles we had tested met all the requirements at A1, we believe that it will be feasible and 
practicable for A1 to meet the proposed test requirements.  An air bag supplier, Takata, has a 
curtain designed specifically to perform well when tested to the proposed impact test.  Takata has 
indicated the design will meet a displacement limit of 100 mm at all target locations, including 
A1 (Docket NHTSA-2006-26467-19).   
  
We believe that based on the evidence available to us, complete window coverage is critical to 
the effective performance of the ejection countermeasure.  Testing done with a rollover fixture 
showed that sometimes the dummy migrates to and can find an opening in the ejection mitigation 
curtain.223  As shown in Figure VII-2, excluding A1 as a target point will allow curtains to have 
                                                          
223 Section IV. B. of the NPRM explains the agency’s position (see pages 16-20 of the preamble): “NHTSA 
undertook several research programs using a dynamic rollover fixture (DRF), which produced full-dummy ejection 
kinematics in an open window condition, to assess the potential effectiveness of ejection mitigation countermeasures 
in a rollover.  These countermeasures included several designs of inflatable curtain air bags, advanced laminated 
glazing, and combinations of curtains and advanced glazing.  The results showed, however, that not all ejection 
mitigation air bag curtains work the same way.  Full window opening coverage is key to the effectiveness of the 
curtain in preventing ejection.” 
 
 
   VII- 15
an opening in the window coverage at that target location.  In addition, it will allow a potential 
gap around this opening.  (In this chapter the term “potential gap” is assumed to mean a portion 
of the window that is covered but only by material that does not retain the headform to the 
proposed deflection limit.  It can be thought of as an area of inadequate or insufficient coverage.  
The term “partial curtain” refers to a curtain that has an opening at A1.)  Nevertheless, we 
examined the potential safety impact of a headform test without testing the point A1 in the front 
window opening area.  However, trying to determine the benefits derived from a partial curtain 
and how that may impact individual manufacturer’s designs was difficult, since we do not fully 
understand how occupants eject through a particular point in the window opening area.    
 
One way of estimating the incremental benefits of a rollover curtain bag, which is designed to 
meet the displacement requirement at all four impact points, over a bag that is designed to meet 
only three impact points (A2 through A4) is to analyze the risk of ejection through the front low 
corner (A1).

In the benefit analysis, we estimated that the risk of ejection through a potential gap between the 
window sill and the bottom of a rollover curtain bag (see Figure VII-3) is relatively small.  If the 
opening area is divided into four quadrants and ejections through each quadrant is represented by 
the linear headform impact in that area, the risk of ejection through the lower forward quadrant 
(A1, between the A-pillar and the window sill) would be 5%224 for belted occupants and 16% for 
unbelted occupants, as shown in Figures VII-4 and VII-5.  
 
 
 
 
  
                                                          
224 For example, in the benefit chapter, we estimated that belted occupants have a 33% risk of ejection through the 
lower portion of the window opening and a 17% risk of ejection through the forward portion of the opening.  With 
the 5% ejection risk through the sunroof, the risk of ejection through the lower quadrant would be 5% 
(33%x17%x95%=5%)

Figure VII -5  Unbelted Occupants, Risk of Ejection through Each Quadrant  
 
As discussed, even if the opening area is fully covered, some ejections could occur through a 
potential gap between the curtain and the window sill.  For example, for belted occupants, the 
risk of ejection through the lower rearward quadrant (which contains the A2) is about 26%.  
Previously, we estimated that a potential gap can be formed in the bottom 1/3 of the front 
window opening of a Toyota Camry (which has an opening height of approximately 18 inches).  
If the ejections through the quadrant were evenly distributed, the risk of ejection through the 
                                                          
225 Based on ejections in real world crashes, we assumed that 5% of ejections would occur through the sunroof. 
226 Note that, due to limited data, we used the vertical ejection distribution of belted occupants as a proxy for 
unbelted occupants.  
   VII- 18
potential gap in the lower rearward quadrant (A2) would be approximately 17% (17.3%).227  
Likewise, under the assumption, the risk of ejection through the potential gap in the low forward 
area would be about 3% (3.3%).228  In other words, if the window opening is divided into four 
quadrants and each quadrant is represented by an impact point in the quadrant, the hypothetical 
full-covered rollover curtain bag would be 79% effective in preventing belted occupant ejections 
(1-(0.173+0.033) = 0.794, 79.4%fully covered curtain.   
 
In the benefit chapter, we determined that the curtain may or may not prevent the headform from 
ejection through the lower portion of the window area below the C.G. of the headform even if 
the opening is completely covered.  Accordingly, we assumed that the air bag would not be 
effective in preventing ejections through the lower 1/3 portion of the window opening area (i.e., 
potential gap).  In addition, we determined that there would be a potential gap at the front edge of 
the bag, adjacent to the A-pillar.  Similar to the methodology used for the containment 
effectiveness of a full curtain bag in the benefit chapter, the partial curtain (which would not 
cover the front lower corner of the window opening) would not be effective in preventing 
occupants from ejection through the area surrounding the front lower opening (A1), even if it is 
covered by the air bag cloth.  In other words, the partial curtain would allow ejections through 
the front lower opening and also the potential gap surrounding the opening.  When the risk of 
ejections through the front opening and the potential gaps are considered, the partial curtain 
would be 58% effective in preventing belted occupants and 48% effective in preventing unbelted 
occupants in fatal rollover crashes. 
 
                                                          
227 26% ejections would occur through the lower 50% of the opening.  If the ejections were evenly distributed, 
accordingly, 17% of ejection would occur through the 1/3 of the window area [26%x(1/3)]/(1/2) = 17% (17.3%).  
2285% of the ejections would occur through the lower forward quadrant.

We note that the derived containment effectiveness for the partial curtain system was based on 
several conditions and assumptions including: (a) the air bag has displacements of less than 100 
mm in the other impact points, (b) the risk of ejection through a particular area in each quadrant 
is evenly distributed, and (c) there is a potential gap between the bag and the surrounding 
structure (such as window sill and A-pillar) when the bag is not completely attached to the 
structure. 
 
We note that although we only tested a small number of rollover curtain bags, it appears from 
our tests that the vertical location of the tether anchor at the A-pillar should be lower than the 
center of gravity of the head-form impact point to withstand the load.  Since the two lower 
impact points (A1 and A2) in the front window opening area are approximately at the same 
vertical distance from the window sill (as shown in Figure VII-7), the tether line (or lines) would 
go across the front forward area.  We believe that these tether lines could prevent some occupant 
ejections through the corner gap.  However, we do not have any laboratory or field data to 
quantify this very limited possible effectiveness (from tether lines).  (Some air bag manufacturers 
are developing curtain bags that are not utilizing tether lines to attach the bag to the A-pillar.  
Instead of tether lines, the bag is attached to the A-pillar with strong load bearing fabric.  The 
fabric would be more effective than the tether lines in preventing occupants from ejection 
through the front lower opening.)     
   VII- 21
 
Figure VII-7. Illustration of the tether lines 
In summary, we divided the window opening area into four quadrants and assumed that ejections 
through each area are represented by the linear head-form impact in that quadrant.  We believe 
this analysis provides a minimum estimate of the potential loss in containment effectiveness if 
Point A1 is removed, i.e., it is an upper bound of the effectiveness of such a rollover curtain.  
Even at its minimum estimate, it appears that the reduction in containment by allowing an 
opening at Point A1 would have significant effects on the overall system effectiveness in 
rollovers.  As explained below, for the initial impact to the curtain air bag, the overall system 
effectiveness would decrease from 48% to 39% for belted occupants.  For unbelted occupants, 
the system effectiveness would reduce from 44% to 32%.

Reduction in benefit:  Previously in the benefits chapter, we estimated that a total of 538 lives 
would be saved under the proposed test requirements (before adjustments for compliance and 
installation rates).  When the overall system effectiveness rates as shown in Tables VII-13 thru 
VII-15 were applied to the fatal injury population, assuming no compliance, it would result in an 
upper range estimate230 of 431 lives saved (compared to 538 lives saved with the full curtain).  
                                                          
229 As discussed in the benefit chapter, the Winnicki’s reduction rates were based on unbelted occupants.  Therefore, 
the use of unbelted occupant reduction rates would underestimate the overall system effectiveness.   
230 The upper range estimate of the benefits of a system excluding A1 assume that an occupant has only one chance 
of going out the area not covered by A1 (potential gap) and also the gap left by A1, regardless of severity of the 
rollover represented by the number of ¼-turns.  As we explain below, a more reasonable estimate of the benefits of a 
   VII- 23
When A1 is excluded from the test requirements, therefore, it would result in a 20% reduction in 
fatal saving (108 less, 538 - 431 = 108 lives).   
 
If we exclude A1 from meeting the test requirements, some occupants could move to the opening 
after impacting the curtain.  By not analyzing this ejection potential, the analysis above may have 
overestimated the effectiveness of a countermeasure with a large gap in the window opening.  
That is, more occupants could be ejected through the opening at A1 than estimated in the 
analysis.  We have found it difficult to estimate the extent to which occupants will move to 
openings and/or gaps in curtain coverage.   
 
Nonetheless, we believe it is reasonable to expect that this movement, and therefore ejection 
potential, is related to the severity of the rollover.  A metric of severity available to us is the 
number of ¼-turns.  So as a surrogate for occupant movement to the opening, under this analysis 
we assume that for each complete vehicle revolution (4 ¼-turns) the occupant has an opportunity 
to impact the window opening.  To perform this analysis we examined the agency’s 1988 – 2005 
NASS CDS database, as shown below in Figure VII-8.   
                                                                                                                                                                                           
system excluding A1 assumes that an unbelted occupant gets multiple chances of going out the gap left by A1, 
depending on the rollover severity.

Outcome 
 
The figure shows that the majority (50% break-point in population) of fatal completely ejected 
occupants exposed to rollovers crashes are in vehicles that roll more than five ¼-turns.  
Similarly, the 50% break-point for fatal partial ejections is about three ¼-turns.  We note that 
these data are for all ejection portals and not just side window openings.   Table VII-16 shows 
the population of completely ejected and partially ejected fatalities at each complete vehicle roll 
break-point.

Previously, we estimated that excluding A1 from meeting the requirements would result in 20%

adjusted with the current compliance rate and the expected voluntarily installed rollover bags), as

After the initial loading of the air bag, some unbelted occupants will move to an opening in the 
window coverage in lateral rollovers.  To get closer to the lower end of the range of 
effectiveness, we assumed that occupants get another chance to be ejected through the opening at 
Point A1 for each complete vehicle revolution.  The method assumes that an occupant impacts 
the air bag in each roll.  (Picture a trashcan; first, cover it with a strong but elastic fabric; then, 
make a hole in the fabric.  You drop a ball onto the fabric.  Some would go through the hole and 
some would be retained by the fabric.  This could be considered as “one-time” containment.  
After that, pick up the ball and drop it again, some times the ball would stay on the fabric and 
   VII- 26
other times it would go through the hole.  This would represent an occupant who hit the air bag 
in the second roll and go out.)  In the previous discussion, we estimated that the partial curtain 
system would have a containment effectiveness of 48%.  Under the assumption, the containment 
for the occupants would be 48%, 23% (48% * 48% = 23%), and 20% (48%*48%*48 = 20%), 
respectively, for the following three rolls. 
 
As discussed above, the real world crash data showed that 46%, 42% and 12% of the completely 
ejected fatally injured occupants were from 1 to 4 ¼-turns, 5 to 8 ¼-turns and 9+ ¼ turns, 
respectively.  For partially ejected occupant fatalities, 75% were from 1 to 4 ¼-turns, 21% were 
from 5 to 8 ¼-turns and the remaining 12% were from 9+ ¼-turns.231  Under the assumptions of 
this analysis the partial curtain air bag would save 357 lives (267 additional lives saved when 
adjusted with the compliance and installation rates at the lower end of the range, which is 
discussed in the following section), as shown below in Tables VII-18a - c      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
231 We assume that these ¼-turn percentages represent both belted and unbelted partial ejections since our target 
population of partial ejection fatalities is about evenly split between belted and unbelted occupants.

Table VII-8b shows that 42% and 21% of complete and partial fatal ejections were in two roll 
crashes, respectively.  Note that, for example, the containment effective decreased from 48% to 
23% (48% * 48% = 23%) for unbelted partial fatalities in two roll crashes.  The 23% 
containment effectiveness is based on an assumption that if an occupant impacts the window 
opening area during the first roll, the occupant would impact the window opening area again 
during the second roll.

The agency’s headform test results show that none of the tested curtain bags met the 100 mm 
deflection requirement at the A1.  When adjusted with the belt use rates (15% belted and 85% 
unbelted fatalities in rollovers), 46% of the ejections could be prevented with the currently 
available mitigation systems (0%+5%+6%+35% = 46%.  See the benefit chapter for additional 
discussion), as shown in Table VII-19.

With the 55% MY 2011 installation rate, we estimated that about 25% (25.27%) of the potential 
fatal benefits could be achieved with the curtain bag (that is in compliance with the headform test 
requirements, 46%containment x 55%installation = 25%with current system).  When the 25% potential fatal 
benefits are subtracted from the 357 lives saved, it results in 267 incremental fatal benefits.  
Thus, the incremental fatal benefits decrease from 402 to 267 lives, and the injury reduction 
benefits decrease from 310 to 201 injuries.  (See Appendix K for detailed calculation.)      
 
Reduction in cost: In order to meet the proposed deflection requirement at the A1, manufacturers 
may use laminated glazing.  In the cost chapter, we estimated that if vehicles manufacturers 
replace tempered glass with laminated glass for standard size front window, the associated unit 
cost would be about $24 per window  (in 2006 economics).  If all light vehicles are equipped 
with laminated glazing in the front window, the expected incremental total cost associated with 
the glazing would be about $816 million (17 million x $24 x 2 per vehicles = $816 million).  If 
laminated glazing is required to meet the deflection required at the A1, the exclusion would 
reduce the incremental cost by $816 million.  
 
We note that the $816 million cost saving is based on an assumption that laminated glazing is 
needed to comply with the proposed 100 mm deflection requirement at the A1.  However, if 
   VII- 31
vehicle manufacturers are able to design an ejection mitigation system to meet the proposed 
requirement without utilizing laminated glazing, the exclusion of the A1 from the requirement 
would result in a relatively small reduction in cost per vehicle.  In the cost chapter, we estimated 
that the unit cost for the air bag cloth would be $0.00327 per cm2 based on the 5,161 cm2 curtain 
of a Toyota Camry, which has a 6,619 cm2 window opening area, we estimated that 
manufacturers would spend an additional $9.53 per vehicle to widen the curtain bag to 
completely cover the window opening area.232  When the A1 is excluded from the requirement, 
we estimate that 729 cm2 of the window opening would not be covered by a bag.233  Therefore, 
we estimate about $101 million, if the low forward quadrant is not covered by a curtain bag.234  
With an estimated 17 million annual vehicle production, the exclusion of A1 would result in 
$5.94 per vehicle (with total incremental cost of $482M).  In summary, we compared the 
incremental costs and benefits.  When the low forward impact point, A1 is excluded from the 
impact requirements, it would result in 267 additional lives saved.  The estimated benefits and 
costs show that excluding A1 from the test requirements would have a significant impact on the 
overall system effectiveness.  The number of lives saved and the net savings for the full curtain 
and excluding A1 are shown below:

cm2, $0.00327/cm2 x 729 = $2.38 per side.  $2.38 x 2= $4.77 per vehicle. Previously we estimated $2.36 for the 
inflator incremental cost.  $2.36 x ½ = $1.18.  Total reduction in cost = $5.94 ($4.77 + $1.18 = $5.94) per vehicles.  
With 17 million vehicles, 17x$5.94 = $101.M.

235 If the methodology used to derive the lower estimate is used for the full curtain, it would result in 333 lives saved 
(instead of the estimated 402 additional lives saved).   
   VII- 33
 
 
 
We note that the lower estimate (267 additional lives saved) is based on an assumption that 
occupants get only one chance to impact the window opening area for each complete vehicle 
revolution.  However, as D. Knapton observed in his rollover film analysis,236 occupants move 
inside a vehicle and could impact the window opening area more than once during a single roll.  
Therefore, the actual lower end of range could be lower than the estimated 267 lives saved.  
However, the agency does not have information to determine this minimum value when the front 
corner opening is excluded from the test requirements.  
 
In the benefits chapter, we used the uniform risk of ejection as an alternative to the weighted risk 
of ejection.  The uniform risk of ejection assumes that the risk of ejection through the window 
opening is uniformly distributed.  When the uniform distribution method was used, it showed 
that the lower end of the range decreased to 245 lives saved, as shown below.

 (6) 100% belt use rate:  If all observed occupants wear safety belts, a substantial number of 
fatalities in the target population would be prevented.  “Observed” usage essentially means 
daytime usage – that is when NHTSA observes usage.  However, in terms of usage in potentially 
fatal crashes, 100% observed usage in the daytime equates to 91% usage in all potentially fatal 
crashes since the agency has found that nighttime usage in fatal crashes is about 18 percentage 
                                                          
236 For detailed discussion, see the containment discussion in the benefit chapter. 
   VII- 34
points lower than daytime usage and fatalities for this group are weighted about 50% during the 
day and 50% during the night.   
 
With 100% observed safety belt use, we expect that the number of fatalities would decrease from 
1,392 to 862.  With the 862 fatalities, the ejection mitigation system would save 249 lives.  (See 
Appendix H for additional discussion).  Hypothetically, we could assume that all occupants 
could wear safety belts at all times.  In other words, we could assume that all fatally injured 
occupants used safety belts in rollovers.  If unbelted occupants are turned into belted occupants, 
the number of rollover crashes remain the same, however, there is a higher target population of 
belted occupants that could have partial ejections (essentially their head going out the window 
and hitting the ground).  So, belted benefits go up from the ejection mitigation curtains.  The 
benefits of the ejection mitigation curtain (rather than just the side air bag curtain) for belted 
people would come from keeping the curtain inflated for the six seconds.   Often in rollover 
crashes the ejection occurs at the end of the rollover sequence, as evidenced by where the body 
lies and the vehicle’s final position.  If all fatally injured occupants in the target population used 
safety belts, the number of fatalities would decrease from 1,392 to 658.  In the target population, 
there were 1,392 fatalities.  Among the 1,392 fatalities, 163 were belted occupants and the 
remaining 1,229 were unbelted.  In the benefits chapter, we estimated that the ejection mitigation 
would save 51 belted occupants.  With the 51 lives saved, the overall system effectiveness would 
be 31% (51/163 = 0.31).  When the 31% effectiveness was applied to the 658 fatalities, it shows 
that 206 lives would be saved with the ejection mitigation system when all occupants in crashes 
used safety belts.

(7)  Crashes involving alcohol: For the benefits estimate, the agency’s 1997-2005 NASS 
Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and fatalities counts adjusted to 2005 FARS levels were 
used.  According to the crash data, there were 4,395 fatalities in the target population, before 
adjustments for electronic stability control (ESC) implementation.  If we exclude from our 
baseline target population crashes with unknown alcohol involvement, the population is reduced 
to 3,138 occupants.237  Table VII-25 shows that 58% of the fatalities in the target population are 
in alcohol related crashes.238

The NASS data show that the seat belt use rate was much lower when drivers were under the 
influence of alcohol when compared to sober drivers in the target population.  As shown below, 
76% of drunk drivers were not wearing a seat belt in fatal crashes.

237 We define an alcohol involved/related crash as one where any involved driver was under the influence of alcohol. 
238 Among the occupant fatalities in crashes where there was a drunk driver, 74% were drivers, 26% were 
passengers. 
   VII- 36
When the baseline target population is adjusted for 100 percent ESC implementation, we 
estimate 1,392 fatalities.  When the 58% alcohol involved fatalities were excluded from this 
target population, it resulted in 797 alcohol related fatalities, as shown below. 
 
Table VII-27 shows that among the 797 alcohol related fatalities, 609 would be unbelted and the 
189 would be belted occupants.  The 609 unbelted and 189 belted fatalities were redistributed 
according to the percent frequency of belted and unbelted fatalities in the target population, as 
shown in Appendix I.

As shown in Appendix I, when all drunk driver related fatalities were excluded from the target 
population, the fatalities in the target population decreased from 1,392 to 595.  With the decrease 
number of fatalities in the target population, the potential benefits would decrease from 402 lives 
saved to 147 lives saved.  When adding injuries to the 147 lives saved, there are 180 ELS with 
no discount.  The 3% and 7% discount ELS values are 147 and 117, respectively.   
 
Summary of Sensitivity Analyses:  In this chapter, we discussed the change in costs and benefits 
that result from different assumptions used in the analysis.  The factors that were examined 
include the cost of side impact sensors, the effectiveness of the rollover sensor, the use of 
laminated glazing, the use of a uniform distribution of ejection through the opening, and 
ejections through the 2nd and 3rd row window openings.  The three factors affecting benefits 
(sensor effectiveness, laminated glazing and uniform distribution) showed that the ejection 
mitigation system could save 581 (additional) lives, annually, in the most favorable conditions 
   VII- 37
(curtain and advanced glazing in the front window and 95% sensor effectiveness).  When the 
least favorable factors were used (77% sensor effectiveness, no advanced glazing and uniform 
ejection distribution in the window open area), the sensitivity analyses showed at least 390 
(additional) lives would be saved, annually, as shown in Figure VII-10.239

Figure VII-10. Range of estimated benefits with different assumptions used 
When the sensor effectiveness decreases from 95% supplier higher estimate to 90% supplier lower estimate and 
77% used in the benefit analysis for the curtain + glazing system, Figure VII-1 shows that the number of 
additional lives saved would decrease from 581 to 556 and 494, respectively.  The middle 
regression line shows that 66 more lives could be saved by a curtain (only) system if the sensor 
effectiveness increases from 77% to 95% (468 – 402 = 66 lives).  However, the upper and 
middle linear regression lines in Figure VII-1 show that the use of advanced glazing would result 
in 19 percent increase in number of lives saved.240  The lower linear regression line shows that a 
curtain ejection mitigation system (without advanced glazing) could save at least 390 additional 
                                                          
239 At the time of this analysis impactor test data for the 2nd row window opening for passenger cars was not 
available.  As a result, we are not certain whether advanced glazing is needed for the 2nd row.  Nevertheless, based 
on the impactor test results, we believe that laminated glazing may not be needed in the 2nd opening area to meet the 
proposed displacement requirement.   
240 1-(402/494) = 19% increase with 77% sensor effectiveness rate.

When the front lower area, A1 is excluded from meeting the head form requirements, the number 
of additional lives saved decreased substantially from 402 for the full curtain to 267 for the 
partial curtain.  In addition, the analysis showed that the full curtain air bag system would be 
more cost effective than the partial curtain (i.e., the partial curtain has a 25% [(2.47-1.98)/1.98] 
higher cost/ELS).  
VIII-1 
VIII. ALTERNATIVES    
 
There were a number of alternative regulatory approaches the agency considered for this 
rulemaking.  These alternatives include: 
1. Require the front lower corner of the front side window area (test point A1) to meet the 
deflection requirement at a lower impact speed of 20 km/h.  
2. Require a single impact at the center of the side window opening area.  
Each of these is discussed below: 
 
Alternative 1: Test point A1 at a lower impact speed of 20 km/h.   
This is a headform test run with a lower impact speed of 20 km/h at point A1 in the front window 
opening area.  We attempted to analyze separately the effect of testing the A1 at a lower impact 
speed in the ejection mitigation test.  However, trying to determine the benefits of these aspects 
and how the manufacturers might react to them individually was difficult, since we do not fully 
understand how occupants eject through a particular point in the window opening area.    
 
1.A. Reduction in containment effectiveness: One way of estimating the incremental benefits of 
a fully covered rollover curtain bag, which designed to meet the displacement requirement at all 
four impact points, over a full curtain bag that is designed to meet the requirements at three 
impact points A2 through A4 but at a lower speed at A1 is to analyze the risk of ejection through 
the front low corner, A1.  As discussed in the test data chapter in this PRIA, we did not find any 
curtain bags (whether they are deigned for side, rollover or both) that met the 100 mm 
displacement criteria at all impact points since most of the bags tested did not cover this area.   
VIII-2 
 
In the benefit analysis, we estimated that the risk of ejection through a potential gap between the 
window sill and the bottom of a rollover curtain bag is relatively small.  We used two different 
approaches to estimate the risk of ejection through a particular area in the window opening, 
namely, weighted risk of ejection and uniform risk of ejection.  In this section, we estimated the 
reduction in benefits when the A1 area is subjected to a lower impact force.  In addition to the 
weighted and uniform risk of ejection approaches, a modified methodology was used to estimate 
the containment effectiveness of a fully covered curtain bag that is designed to meet the lower 
impact force.  Unlike the method used in the benefits chapter, the opening area is divided into 
four quadrants and ejections through each quadrant are represented by the liners headform 
impact in that area.        
 
First, with the weighted risk of ejection approach, under the assumption discussed above, the risk 
of ejection through the lower forward quadrant (A1, between the A-pillar and the window sill)

As discussed in the benefits chapter, even if the opening area is fully covered, some ejections 
could occur through a potential gap between the curtain and the window sill.  For example, for 
belted occupants, the risk of ejection through the lower rearward quadrant (which contains the 
A2) is about 26%.  Previously, we estimated that a potential gap can be formed in the bottom 1/3 
of the front window opening of a Toyota Camry (which has an opening height of approximately 
                                                          
241 For example, in the benefits chapter, we estimated that belted occupants have a 33% risk of ejection through the 
lower portion of the window opening and a 17% risk of ejection through the forward portion of the opening.  With 
the 5% ejection risk through the sunroof, the risk of ejection through the lower quadrant would be 5% 
(33%x17%x95%=5%)  
242 Based on ejections in real world crashes, we assumed that 5% of ejections would occur through the sunroof. 
243 Note that, due to limited data, we used the vertical ejection distribution of belted occupants as a proxy for 
unbelted occupants.  Additional discussion on the risk of ejection is provided in the benefits chapter.

18 inches).  If the ejections through the quadrant were evenly distributed, the risk of ejection 
through the potential gap in the lower rearward quadrant (A2) would be approximately 17% 
(17.3%).244  Likewise, under the assumption, the risk of ejection through the potential gap in the 
low forward gap would be about 3% (3.3%).245  In other words, if the window opening is divided 
into four quadrants and each quadrant is represented by an impact point in the quadrant, the 
hypothetical full-covered rollover curtain bag would be 73% effective in preventing belted 
occupant ejections (52.8% + 8.8% + 9.7% + 1.8% =  73.0% fully covered curtain.

Although the method previously used in the benefits chapter and this alternative method result in 
similar containment effectiveness rates, we note that the assumptions used in these methods are 
slightly different.   Unlike the assumption made for the current method, the previous 
methodology in the benefits chapter assumed that there is a potential gap between the front of the 
curtain and the A-pillar even if the system is capable of meeting the requirement at the A1.  In 
the benefits chapter, we determined that the curtain may or may not prevent the head form from 
ejection through the lower portion of the window area below the C.G. of the head form even if 
                                                          
244 26% of the ejections would occur through the lower rearward quadrant.  If the ejections were evenly distributed, 
accordingly, 17% of ejection would occur through the 1/3 of the window area, [26%x(1/3)]/(1/2) = 17% (17.3%].  
2455% of the ejections would occur through the lower forward quadrant.  If the ejections were evenly distributed, 3% 
of the ejections would occur through the 1/3 of the window area [5%x(1/3)]/(1/2) = 3% (3.3%)].

the opening is completely covered.  Accordingly, we assumed that the air bag would not be 
effective in preventing ejections through the lower 1/3 portion of the window opening area (i.e., 
potential gap).  Similar to the methodology used for the containment effectiveness of a full 
curtain bag in the benefit chapter, the full but reduced force at A1 curtain would not be effective 
in preventing occupants from ejection through a potential gap between the curtain and the 
window sill.   
 
For unbelted occupants, with the weighted distribution method, the partial curtain would be 69% 
effective in preventing ejection in rollover crashes.246

We note that the derived containment effectiveness for the lower impact force at A1 air bag 
system was based on several conditions and assumptions including: (a) the air bag has 
displacements of less than 100 mm in the other impact points and (b) the risk of ejection through 
a particular area in each quadrant is evenly distributed, and (c) there is a potential gap between 
the bag and the surrounding structure (such as window sill).                
                                                          
246 We estimated that 31.7%, 5.3%, 27.2%, and 5.3% of occupants would ejected through the upper-rear, lower-rear, 
upper-front, and lower-front quadrants, respectively.

Although we only tested a small number of rollover curtain bags, it appears that the vertical 
location of the tether anchor at the A-pillar should be lower than (the CG of) the headform 
impact point to withstand the load.  Since the two lower impact points (A1 and A2) in the front 
window opening area are approximately at the same vertical distance from the window sill (as 
shown in Figures VIII-1 and VIII-4), the tether line (or lines) would go across the front forward 
area.  We believe that these tether lines would be shortened and the opening could be covered 
with load baring fabric (i.e. fully covered) to meet the 20 km/h impact force requirement.  
However, we do not have any laboratory or field data to quantify this limited effectiveness (from 
tether lines).   (Some air bag manufacturers are developing curtain bags that are not utilizing 
tether lines to attach the bag to the A-pillar.  Instead of tether lines, the bag is attached the A-
pillar with strong load baring fabric.  The fabric would be more effective than the tether lines in 
preventing occupants from ejection through the front lower opening.)

In the previous section above, we estimated the risk of ejection through a particular area in the 
window opening and derived containment effectiveness values for both belted and unbelted 
occupants.  When a curtain bag meets the proposed 100 mm displacement requirement at a linear 
impactor speed of 24 km/h, it would capture all potential benefits.  However, when the impact 
speed decreases to, for example, a 20 km/h at a certain area below the proposed 24 km/h, some 
of occupants would eject through this area. 
 
With a fully covered curtain air bag, all window ejections (whether partial or complete) would 
initially impact the air bag in rollovers.  We believe that when the occupant impact energy 
increases, the risk of ejection through the curtain covered window opening would increase.  
However, we do not know the number of occupants impacting the bag at a given occupant-to-
window approaching speed.   
 
For the analysis, we considered two different approaches, as discussed below: 
 
For the first approach, we assumed that the number of occupants impacting a curtain air bag 
would be evenly distributed with respect to occupant-to-window approaching speed when the 
opening is fully covered.  In other words, we assumed that the number of window approaching 
VIII-8 
occupants is the same when the 0-24 km/h speed range is divided equally into different speed 
segments (i.e., speed “bin”).  Under this assumption, the containment effectiveness would 
decrease by 16.7% when the curtain air bag is designed to meet the 100 mm displacement 
requirement at an impact speed of 20 km/h (instead of 24 km/h).   
 
Although the first approach would result in a simple estimation of the loss, the agency does not 
have any field or laboratory data to support the assumption used for the approach.  Alternatively, 
for the second approach, we estimated the loss based on real world crashes and laboratory 
dummy ejection data.  According to the agency’s NASS 1999-2007 CDS, there were 2.2 million 
vehicles in lateral rollover crashes.  Among the 2.2 million vehicles, 973,000 were passenger 
cars and 679,000 were SUVs, 127,000 were Vans and 408,000 were light trucks, as shown 
below:

Figure VIII-7 Number of vehicles in rollovers by ¼-turn 
 
 
The real world rollover crash data showed that the majority of vehicles rolled less than 7 quarter 
turns and that the number of vehicles decreases drastically as the number of quarter turns 
increases.  In addition, it appears that the geometry of a vehicle affects the tendency of first ¼-
turn.  SUVs and vans, which have a relatively high C.G. when compared to passenger cars and 
light trucks, had a greater tendency of (first ¼-turn) rollover.  When the rollovers were separated 
by ½-turn (i.e., one ¼-turn and two ¼ -turns into a ½-turn bin, etc.) it showed that the majority of 
rollovers were less than three ½-turn rollovers, as shown below:

A series of simulations were performed by the agency to recreate three NASS investigated 
rollover crashes with ejected occupants.247  The vehicles are listed in the first column of Table

VIII-3.  These simulations were performed to study the injury potential of advanced glazing, but 
they also gave important insight into the relative velocity of ejected occupants with respect to the 
window areas through which they were ejected. 
 
The circumstances of the Toyota pickup rollover was that the vehicle was traveling at 96 km/h 
and went into a sharp turn and yaw, which resulted in a rollover.  In the case of the Corrolla, it 
was also traveling 96 km/h on a gravel road.  The vehicle went out of control and left the road, 
resulting in roll initiation.  The Volkswagen was traveling at 88 km/h when the driver fell asleep 
and the vehicle left the road.  It struck a rock embankment and rolled over. 
 
A vehicle handling simulation software was used to reconstruct the vehicle motion up to the 
point where the vehicle started to roll.  The linear and angular velocity at the end of the vehicle 
handling simulation was then used to drive a MADYMO lumped parameter model of the vehicle 
to compute its complete rollover motion.  Finally, the motion of the vehicle obtained from the 
MADYMO vehicle model was used to drive a MADYMO occupant simulation. 
 
Table VIII-3 shows the simulation resultant head velocity through the open window when the 
occupant was ejected.  The simulations were also performed with unbroken glazing to determine 
impact velocities with intact glazing.  Table VIII-3 also shows the computed resultant maximum 
head and torso velocities at contact with the intact glazing for the un-ejected occupant. 
 
It is interesting to note that the slowest head velocity is for the occupant ejected through the open 
window on the first ¼ turn (Toyota pickup).  As might be expected, head velocity was greater 
VIII-12 
than torso velocity.  The maximum head velocity was 22 km/h for the Jetta unrestrained 
occupant into the window opening.  The maximum torso velocity was 16 km/h, also for the 
unrestrained Jetta occupant. 
 
The modeling is also instructive in showing that ejections can occur both early (1st ¼-turn for 
Toyota PU) and late (last ¼-turn for Corolla and Jetta) in the rollover event.

The head-to-glazing speed measurements showed that in general the occupant approaching speed 
increases as the number of ¼-turn increases.  In addition, although the head-to-glazing speed 
measurements were made in laboratory test conditions, it showed that the increase in initial 
VIII-15 
kinetic energy would result in a higher number of quarter turns and that the occupant-to-glazing 
speed increases as the number of quarter-turns increase in rollovers.  If the total kinetic energy 
associated with the subject vehicle just before it rolls, we could express the number of rolls as a 
function of the initial speed, as shown below:

The equation (6) shows a mathematical relationship between the initial vehicle speed and the 
number of rolls.  In the field data discussed above, the Toyota pickup was traveling at 96 km/h 
and went into a sharp turn and yaw, which resulted in a rollover.  The Corrolla was also traveling 
96 km/h on a gravel road.  The vehicle went out of control and left the road, resulting in roll 
initiation.  The Volkswagen was traveling at 88 km/h when the driver fell asleep and the vehicle 
left the road.  It struck a rock embankment and rolled over.  For these three cases, our modeling 
showed that  on average when the initial speed increased from 88 km/h to 96 km/h (8% increase 
VIII-16 
in speed) the head-to-glazing speed increase from 16 km/h to 17 km/h (6% increase in speed), as

The results in Table VIII-4 showed that the head-to-glazing speed is about 18% of the initial 
vehicle speed regardless of the initial speed (i.e., 88 km/h and 96 km/h).  Based on the 
simulation, we assumed that the occupant-to-glazing speed is proportional to the vehicle’s initial

The results in Table VIII-5 showed that the majority of rollovers are less than eleven ¼-turns.  
Therefore, for the analysis, we only considered rollovers with 1-10 ¼-turns.  In addition, since 
the agency believes that the proposed 24 km/h impactor requirement would prevent the majority 
of ejections (both partial and complete) through the side window opening, for the analysis, we 
assumed that the occupant head-to-glazing speed is not greater than 24 km/h.  Furthermore, we 
assumed that the number of occupants in a vehicle in rollover is the same regardless of number 
of rolls.  Under the assumptions, we could estimate the number of occupant at a given number of 
rolls, as shown below:

from 24 km/h to 20 km/h, about 5% of contained occupants at the A1 opening in rollovers would 
be lost when compared to a curtain bag that is designed to meet the displacement requirement at 
an impactor impact speed of 24 km/h.   
 
When the 5% percent reduction rate is applied to the A1 quadrant, the containment effectiveness 
in the front lower corner area decreases slightly, as shown below:

We note that the methodology assumed that all rollovers would be “trip” rollovers and that the 
vehicle’s roll motion would be retarded as the vehicle rolls on the ground.  However, as shown in 
Table VIII-8, just over 50% of light vehicle rollovers were trip rollovers.

In addition, as mentioned in the benefits chapter (B.2.2.1), an occupant in a vehicle subjected to 
a lower number of rolls could experience a relatively high head-to-glazing speed when the 
vehicle (initially) impacts a tree or rigid object during the roll.  In other words, the number of 
occupants with a relatively high head-to-glazing speed could be hidden in the low ¼-turn roll 
categories (i.e., bins).  Therefore, the estimated 5% reduction in containment in the A1 area 
would underestimate the loss resulting from the 20 km/h impact test speed. 
 
For side impacts, we examined real world crashes to determine how the reduction in impactor 
speed (from 24 km/h to 20 km/h) would affect the containment effectiveness of a curtain air bag.  
Figure VIII-16 shows the cumulative percentage of near side impact occupants completely 
ejected, by impact ∆V.  This graph was generated from 704 un-weighted occupant ejections 
representing 15,062 weighted ejections.  Table VIII-9 shows the range, average and mode of 
impact ∆Vs for completely ejected occupants.  The average side impact ∆V for a completely 
ejected occupant was 21.4 km/h.  Table VIII-10 shows the proposed impact test speeds of 16 and 
VIII-21 
24 km/h and the percentage of near side impact occupants completely ejected at ∆Vs at or below 
the test speed.  More than 1/3 of these occupants are ejected in side impacts with ∆V at or above 
24 km/h.

Vehicle structure absorbs part of the impact force in side crashes.  In order to relate crash speed 
(i.e., vehicle delta-V) to occupant delta-V, an occupant delta-V conversion factor of 0.769 was 
used, as shown below:248  
   Table VIII-11.  Vehicle Delta-V and Occupant Delta-V at 24 km/h and 20 km/h 
Occupant Delta-V Vehicle Delta-V Cumulative Percentage 
24 km/h 31 km/h 90% 
20 km/h 26 km/h 80% 
 
The results in Table VIII-10 showed that when the headform impact speed decreases from 24 
km/h to 20 km/h, the percent of contained occupants by a curtain air bag would d decrease from 
90% to 80%, resulting 11% reduction in containment effectiveness.  When the 11% reduction 
rate was applied to the containment effectiveness used for the two sub-target populations, “side 
impact, no rollovers, 12-25 mph” and “side impact, no rollover, children”, the containment 
effectiveness decreased to 89% for these sub-target population groups.       
 
In summary, we divided the window opening area into four quadrants and assumed that ejections 
through each area are represented by the linear headform impact in that quadrant.  Under the 
assumption, the containment effectiveness would decease slightly when the linear impactor test 
speed decreases from 24 km/h to 20 km/h in the low forward quadrant (an overall decrease of 
less than 1% for both belted and unbelted in rollovers and 11% for side impacts).  It appears that 
the reduction in containment at the front-low window opening would have a minor effect on the 
overall system effectiveness, as shown below:

1.B. Reduction in benefit:  According to the 2005 FARS data adjusted with the ESC installation 
rate, there were a total of 750 fatalities in rollover crashes.  Among these fatalities, 112 were 
belted partial, 12 were belted complete, 107 were unbelted partial, and 519 were unbelted partial.  
In addition, there were 643 fatalities involving side impacts in the target population.  With the 
quadrant method with the weighted risk, we estimated that a total of 560 lives would be saved 
under the proposed test requirements (as discussed in the benefit chapter, 418 lives would be 
saved with the quadrant-weighted risk method when the fatal benefits are adjusted with the 
compliance and installation rates).  When the overall system effectiveness rates in Table VIII-12 
were applied to the fatal injury population, assuming no compliance, it would result in 544 lives 
saved.  When the A1 is loaded with an impact speed of 20 km/h, therefore, it would result in a 
3% reduction in fatal saving (1-544/560 = 3%).   
 
The agency’s linear impactor test results show that none of the tested curtain air bags met the 
100 mm displacement at the A1, whereas all bags are capable of meeting the requirement at the 
other impact points.  In the benefit chapter, we estimated that 402 additional lives would be 
saved when the number of lives saved was adjusted with the belt use rates (15% belted and 85%

the use of unbelted occupant reduction rates would underestimate the overall system effectiveness.   
VIII-24 
unbelted fatalities in rollovers),and the 55% MY 2011 installation rate,.   When we applied the 
3% overall percent reduction rate to the 402 additional lives saved, it resulted in 391 additional 
lives saved, as shown below: 
Table VIII-13.

Additional lives saved 402 391 
Additional Injuries prevented 310 301 
       
1.C. Reduction in cost: Although the impact speed decreases from 24 km/h to 20 km/h at the 
front-lower corned, represented by the A1 quadrant, the curtain air bag must be designed to fully 
cover the window opening.  In the cost chapter, we estimated the incremental material costs 
associated with the full-covered curtain based on the increase in material cost.  We believe that 
the cost difference between a fully complying curtain (tested at 24 km/h) and the lower impact 
load curtain (tested at 20 km/h at A1) would be from costs associated with the initial design of 
the countermeasure system, not from additional materials used to fully cover the window 
opening.  Therefore, we assume that lowering the impact at the A1 area would not decrease the 
overall material costs when compared to a full cover curtain bag meeting the proposed 24 km/h 
impact speed.  
Table VIII-14  
Comparing Additional Lives Saved and Material Costs, full Cover Curtain  
Additional Lives Saved Additional Lives Saved Material Costs (in$M) 
Meeting 24 km/h 402 $583 
Meeting 20 km/h at A1 391 $583 
 
In the benefit chapter, we estimated the overall benefits using two different assumptions for the 
containment namely “weighted” and “uniform” risk of ejection through the window opening 
area.  In the previous section above, we estimated that lowering the impact speed from 24 km/h 
VIII-25 
to 20 km/h at the A1 area would reduce the 402 additional lives saved to 391 additional lives 
saved with the “weighted” risk of ejection method.   
 
As mentioned, we estimated the potential lose of fatal benefits with the “uniform” risk of 
ejection in the window opening area when the impact load decreases from 24 km/h to 20 km/h at 
the A1 area.  When ejections through the potential gaps were considered, we estimated that the 
hypothetical full-covered curtain bag would be 65% effective in preventing occupants from 
ejection, when we assume all ejections through the opening are uniformly distributed, as shown 
below:

For the side impacts, similar to the approaches used for the “quadrant-weighted risk” 
containment, we used the 11% reduction in containment in effectiveness for the two sub-groups, 
“Side impact, no rollovers, 12-25 mph” and “Side impact, no rollover, children (0-12 years), 12-
25 mph”. 
 
1.D. Reduction in benefit with 20 km/h at A1 based on uniform risk distribution : With the 
quadrant method and the “uniform risk”, we previously estimated that a total of 531 lives would 
be saved under the proposed test requirements (and, as discussed, 397 additional lives would be 
saved with the quadrant method when the fatal benefits are adjusted with the compliance and 
installation rates).  When the headform impact speed requirement decreases from 24 km/h to 20 
km/h, it would result in 513 lives saved (and 384 additional lives saved).  When the A1 is loaded 
with an impact speed of 20 km/h, therefore, it would result in a 3% reduction in fatal saving.   
When we applied the 3% overall percent reduction to the 390 additional lives saved (that were 
calculated) in the benefit chapter, it resulted in 377 additional lives saved, as shown below: 
Table VIII-15. Estimated Reduction Fatality with Lowering Load at A1, Uniform Risk 
Distribution 
 With 24 km/h With 20 km/h  
Additional lives saved 390 377 
Additional Injuries prevented  296 286 
       
1.E. Reduction in cost: As discussed previously, we believe that the fully complying curtain and 
the lower impact speed curtain would have similar material costs since both curtains are required 
to fully cover the window opening.  As shown in the cost chapter, the estimated increase in cost 
was based on costs associated with materials used for these fully covered curtains.  In other 
words, costs associated with designing of these full curtains were not considered.  Therefore, we 
VIII-27 
assumed that lowering the impact load at the A1 area would not decrease the overall material 
costs when compared to the fully complying curtain bag, as shown below: 
Table VIII-16 Comparing Additional Lives Saved and Material Cost, Full Cover Curtain, with 
Uniform Risk Method 
Additional Lives Saved Additional Lives Saved Material Cost ($M) 
Meeting 24 km/h 390 $583 
Meeting 20 km/h at A1 377 $583 
 
When the impact speed requirement decreases from 24 km/h to 20 km/h at the A1 area (front 
lower corner of the window opening), it would decrease the potential fatal benefits by 3% with 
the uniform risk method.  Whether the bag is required to meet the proposed 24 km/h impact 
speed or a lower impact speed of 20 km/h, the window would be completely covered to meet the 
100 mm displacement requirement.  Therefore, the reduction in impact speed at the A1 area 
would not result in a reduction in material costs, when compared to the full-cover curtain bag.  
We speculate that the “lower speed at A1” curtain bag could be redesigned, without adding 
additional materials, to meet the proposed 24 km/h impact speed requirement, such as 
reconfigure the air chamber in the air bag.   
      
Alternative 2: Effects of requiring a single impact in each side window opening area. 
 In the cost chapter, we estimated that the cost burden on manufacturers would be much small 
when compared to the testing cost to install a curtain air bag that is capable of meeting the 
proposed displacement requirement.  However, when the number of impacts is reduced in the 
opening area, it would substantially reduce the potential benefits, as shown below.      
 
2.A. Reduction in containment effectiveness: In the benefit chapter we estimated potential 
benefits when the window opening area is impacted by the headform at four different points.  As 
VIII-28 
an alternative, we examined effects of requiring a single headform impact test in the window 
opening.  If a rollover curtain air bag were required to meet a certain displacement requirement 
at the geometric center of the window opening, covering of the lower portion of the window area 
would not be necessary to meet the requirement.  Thus, there appears to be no reason why a 
manufacturer would design their air bags to cover the entire opening area if a single impact test 
were adopted.  Similar to the methodology used in the benefit chapter, a rollover curtain air bag 
that is capable of meeting the headform impact requirement at the geometry center may or may 
not be effective in preventing occupants from ejection through the lower portion of the window 
opening.  When the window opening is divided into four quadrants, as shown in Figures VIII-2 
and VIII-3, the containment effectiveness would be about 63% if the curtain is not effective in 
preventing occupant ejections through the lower 50% of the window opening area (52.8% upper rear 
+ 10.6% upper front = 63.4%).250  In addition, as we discussed previously, there would be a potential 
gap between the front of the air bag and the A-pillar, increasing the risk of ejection by 3% for 
belted and 10% for unbelted occupants.251  When the risk of ejection through the front potential 
gap is considered, it resulted in 60% effectiveness for belted and 53% for unbelted occupants in 
rollovers.  When weighted with the belt use rate (15% and 85% for belted and unbelted, 
respectively), it resulted in 55% (54.6%) containment effectiveness in rollovers.  (Several 
assumptions were used for deriving the containment effectiveness.  One of the assumptions was 
that all ejections through the upper portion of the window opening would be prevented with the 
curtain air bag that is designed to meet the single impact headform test requirement.  However, 
                                                          
250 Using the more conservative uniform distribution would give lower effectiveness. 
251 When we excluded the front lower corner of the window opening from meeting the displacement requirement, we 
estimated that the risk of ejection through a potential gap between the front of a bag and the A-pillar would increase 
by 3% (3.2% x 0.95 = 3%) and 10% for belted and unbelted occupants, respectively.  Similarly, there would be a 
potential gap between the curtain and the A-pillar when a curtain bag is designed for a single impact at the 
geometric center of the curtain.  For the analysis, therefore, we assumed that the risk of ejection through the gap 
would increase by the same amount.  
VIII-29 
the impactor test data showed that meeting the displacement requirement at the geometry center 
of the window opening may or may not limit the displacement within the required 100 mm at the 
upper front corner in the window opening, A3 impact point).  In the benefit chapter, we 
estimated that the hypothetical rollover curtain air bag would be about 66% effective in 
preventing occupant from ejection, when both belted and unbelted occupants were combined (i.e. 
15% and 85% fatalities were from belted and unbelted in rollovers).252  When the 55% 
containment effectiveness is used, the overall system effectiveness would decrease from 
45%weighted to 37% weighted (with 77% sensor effectiveness rate and 88% Winnicki’s risk reduction 
rate) in rollover crashes.  Although we derived the effectiveness for a curtain air bag that is 
designed to meet a single impact test requirement in the window opening area, we are far from 
certain how these air bags would behave in real world crashes.  For example, these relatively 
small curtain air bags may not be effective in preventing occupants from complete ejection in 
side crashes, particularly small stature occupants and occupants in the far-side seating 
position.253  Since the single-impact test requirement may or may not result in a “full” curtain air 
bag that covers the entire area of the window opening, as discussed previously in the target 
population section in the benefits chapter, we assumed that the “single-impact” curtain air bag 
would not prevent occupants from complete ejections in side impacts.   
 
2.B. Reduction in benefit: In the target population, we found that 1,068 fatalities in rollover 
crashes.  Among the 1,068 fatalities, 750 were from in rollover without any side crashes, 251 
                                                          
252 In the benefit chapter, we estimated that 15% of fatalities with 71% containment and 85% of fatalities with 65% 
containment effectiveness in rollovers.  .15x.71+.85x.65 = .66, 66%,    
253 In the oblique pole FRIA, completely ejected occupants in side crashes were not included in the target 
population.  The agency determined that side curtain bags with a gap between the curtain and the window sill may 
not be effective in preventing occupants from complete ejection in side crashes.  Accordingly, we assumed that the 
single-impact bag (that would not cover the lower portion of the window opening) would not be effective in 
preventing complete ejections in side crashes.  
VIII-30 
were from side crashes followed by rollovers in all but 12-25 mph, and the remaining 79 were 
from side crashes followed by rollovers in 12-25 mph.  If we assume that the containment 
effectiveness of a rollover curtain air bag remains unchanged in rollover crashes, whether 
preceded by side crashes or not, the overall benefits would decrease from 538 lives saved to 349 
(about 35% reduction).  Previously, we estimated that about 27% of the potential fatal benefits 
could be achieved with the curtain air bag, with the 55% MY 2011 installation rate.  However, 
we do not have data to show what percentage of currently available ejection mitigation curtain 
bags would meet the single impact headform requirement.  Based on the headform impactor data, 
we suspect that the majority of current ejection bags would meet the single impact headform test 
requirement.  For the analysis, therefore, we assumed that all currently available ejection 
mitigation air bags would meet the single impact headform test requirement.  Under the 
assumption, about 52% of the potential benefits could be achieved with currently available 
curtain air bags, with 55% MY 2011 installation rate.  When the 55% potential fatal benefits are 
subtracted from the 349 lives saved, it result in 168 incremental fatal benefits [349lives x (1-0.55) 
= 168 incremental fatal benefits].  Therefore, the incremental fatal benefits would decrease from 402lives 
to 168lives when a single headform impact test is required in the window opening.254  (See 
Appendix E for the detailed derivation). 
 
We note that, for the benefit estimate, we assumed that most of adult occupants would not 
bounce off the bag during a roll motion.  A dimensional analysis of the curtain and the window 
opening area indicates that a very large gap (about 10 inches, 249 mm) can be formed between 
                                                          
254 The single impactor test could result in a curtain bag that has a large opening (gap) in the lower portion of the 
bag.   Unlike fully covered curtain air bag, the containment effectiveness could decrease substantially as the 
occupant slides over the bag after the initial impact.     
VIII-31 
the window sill and the curtain, even if the 100 mm deflection requirement remains 
unchanged.255    
 
2.C. Increase in cost: To meet the single impact test requirement, manufacturers need to replace 
FMVSS No. 214 combo bags with FMVSS No. 214 curtain air bags. In the cost chapter, we 
estimated that about 45% of light vehicles will not be equipped with a roll sensor.  Although the 
agency is not proposing any requirements for the sensor, as discussed, we believe that a rollover 
sensor will be provided as an integral part of the ejection mitigation system.  For the total 
incremental cost associated with the single impact test, when the 45% of light vehicles are 
equipped with the sensor, the incremental cost would be more than $300 million to cover 1st and 
2nd row windows, as shown below:

255 The front side window of a MY 2003 Toyota Camry has a height of 18 inches (457 mm).  When the geometry 
center of the window opening area is moved by 100 mm, hypothetically,  it would create a 249 mm gap, (100)2 + 
[(457)/2]2  = (249)2.   
VIII-32 
Summary of Alternatives: 
There were a number of alternative regulatory approaches the agency considered for this 
rulemaking.  These alternatives include: 
1. Require the front lower corner of the window area A1 to meet the displacement at a linear 
headform impact speed of 20 km/h.  
2. Require a single impact in each side window opening area.  
We compared the incremental costs and benefits associated with these alternatives, as shown in 
Table VIII-18.   
Table VIII-18  
Incremental Costs and Additional Lives Saved for Alternatives 
Costs (millions) Alternatives Lives Saved 
(incremental) 1st & 2nd row 3rd row total 
Proposed Rule (4 impacts) 402 $532 $51 $583 
     
Testing A1 at 20 km/h 391 $532 $51 $583 
     
Single Impact 168 $318 $34* $352 
* We assumed that only top 2/3 of the opening is covered with a curtain ($51M x 2/3 = $34M). 
 
The results in Table VIII-18 show that the proposed linear guided head form test would result in 
402 lives saved, annually, when the window opening is tested at four impact points.  When the 
low forward impact point, A1 is required to be tested at 20 km/h, it would result in 391 lives 
saved.  The estimated benefits and costs show that the first alternative (testing at three impact 
point) would have a moderate impact on the overall system effectiveness.  The analysis of the 
second alternative shows that a rollover curtain air bag that is designed to withstand a load at the 
geometric center of the window opening would also provide substantial benefits (168 lives 
saved, incremental benefits).  However, we are uncertain how this relatively small bag interacts 
with an occupant in rollovers.  In addition, we note that the head form test data show that most of 
currently available rollover air bags would meet the 100 mm displacement requirement when the 
VIII-33 
air bag is tested at three impact point (Alternative 1) or at the center of the window opening.  
Therefore, we expect that the majority, if not all, of manufacturers would be capable of meeting 
the 100 mm displacement requirement in the single-impact head form test.

ACT ANALYSIS 
 
A. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT 
 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C §601 et seq.) requires agencies to evaluate the 
potential effects of their proposed and final rules on small business, small organizations and 
small Government jurisdictions. 
 
5 U.S.C §603 requires agencies to prepare and make available for public comments initial and 
final regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) describing the impact of proposed and final rules on 
small entities.  An RFA is not required if the head of the agency certifies that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  The head of the 
agency has made such a certification. 
 
The factual basis for the certification (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) is set forth below.  Although NHTSA is 
not required to issue an initial RFA, as a means of venting the issues we discuss below many of 
the issues that an initial RFA would address (§604).     
 
Section 603(b) of the Act specifies the content of a RFA.  Each RFA must contain: 
 
1. A description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered; 
2. A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for a final rule; 
3. A description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which 
the final rule will apply; 
 IX- 2
4. A description of the projected reporting, recording keeping and other compliance 
requirements of a final rule including an estimate of the classes of small entities which 
will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; 
5. An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may 
duplicate, overlap or conflict with the final rule; 
6. Each final regulatory flexibility analysis shall also contain a description of any significant 
alternatives to the final rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes 
and which minimize any significant economic impact of the final rule on small entities. 
 
1.  Description of the reason why action by the agency is being considered 
NHTSA is requiring this action to improve the safety of occupants by mitigating ejection through 
side windows in vehicle crashes.  A test condition has been designed to represent the forces of an 
unbelted occupant moving toward a side window.  The test will assess the ability of a 
countermeasure to retain an occupant in the vehicle.  The availability of air bag related 
technologies provides an opportunity for consumers to have affordable protection systems in 
rollover crashes.         
  
2. Objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule 
This proposed rule incorporates a linear head form impactor test into a new Federal Motor 
Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 226, “Ejection mitigation.”  The side window openings 
of light vehicles will be tested with a featureless head form by impacting various areas in the 
window opening at specific impact speeds.  To meet the test requirements, vehicle 
manufacturers will need to assure head and upper body regions are protected in rollover 
 IX- 3
crashes.  It will lead to the installation of new technologies, such as large curtain air bags with 
rollover sensors, which are capable of preventing occupants from ejection in rollover.  The 
curtain air bag systems installed to meet the head form requirements of this proposed rule will 
also reduce fatalities and injuries caused by complete ejections through side windows in side 
crashes.            
 
NHTSA is requiring these changes under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117, 
and 30666; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50.  The agency is authorized to issue Federal 
motor vehicle safety standards that meet the need for motor vehicle safety.  This proposed rule is 
also being issued pursuant to the “Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity 
Act: A Legacy for Users.”  Under chapter 301 of title 49, United States Code, Section 10301 of 
the Act directed the agency to “initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance 
standards to reduce complete and partial ejections of vehicle occupants from outboard seating 
positions.  In formulating the standards the Secretary shall consider various ejection mitigation 
systems.”  In accordance with §10301, the ejection mitigation air bags installed in vehicles will 
enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in rollover crashes and also certain side 
impacts. 
 
3. Description and estimate of the number of small entities to which the final rule will apply 
The final rule will apply to motor vehicle manufacturers, and to second-stage or final stage 
manufacturers, and alterers.  It will affect air bag manufacturers and rollover sensor 
manufacturers.  Business entities now defined as small business using the North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, for the purpose of receiving Small Business 
 IX- 4
Administration assistance.  One of the criteria for determining size, as stated in 13 CFR 121.201, 
is the number of employees in the firm.  For establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing 
or assembling automobiles, light and heavy duty trucks, buses, motor homes, new tires, or motor 
vehicle body manufacturing, the firm must have less than 1,000 employees to be classified as a 
small business.  For supplier establishments manufacturing many of the safety systems, the firm 
must have less than 750 employees to be classified as a small business.  For establishments 
manufacturing motor vehicle seating and interior trim packages, alterers and second-stage 
manufacturers, the firm must have less than 500 employees to be classified as a small business. 
 
Currently, there are six small light vehicle manufacturers in the United States.  Table IX-1 
provides information about the six small volume domestic manufacturers in MY 2007.  All are 
small manufacturers, having much less than 1,000 employees.

The agency has not analyzed the impact of the final rule on these small manufacturers 
individually.  However, the cost is not expected to be substantial.

4. A description of the projected reporting, recording keeping and other compliance requirements 
of a final rule including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the 
requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record .  
4.1. Reporting & Recording Impacts:  
For the liner head form test, the agency is requiring a phase-in schedule starting the first 
September 1 three full year after publication of the final rule.  For illustration purposes assume 
the date to be September 1, 2013.  Based on that date, the phase-in schedule is set forth below.  
Credits will be allowed for early compliance, applicable to the 20 percent, 40 percent and 75 
percent phase-in requirements.   
Table XI-2 
 Final Rule Phase-In Schedule 
Production Period  Percent of each manufacturer’s light vehicles that 
must comply during the production period 
September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014 20 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles 
September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015 40 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles 
September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016 75 percent of a manufacturer’s light vehicles, and 
On or after September 1, 2016 For all light vehicles 
On or after September 1, 2017 Manufacturers with limited carlines  
On or after September 1, 2018 Alterers, multistage manufacturers 
 
As with previous rules, the agency will allow manufacturers that produce three or fewer car lines 
the option of achieving full compliance when the phase-in is completed.  Furthermore, vehicles 
manufactured in two or more stages do not have to comply until one year after the phase-in is 
completed. 
 
For the small domestic automobile manufacturers, the reporting requirements depend upon the 
phase-in option taken.  If they choose a phase-in, then there are reporting requirements to show         
compliance with the phase-in schedule.  If they choose to meet the standard with all models 
 IX- 6
when the phase-in is completed, then there are no reporting requirements.   The information to be 
reported would be developed by management, while an administrative assistant might type up 
and fill out the report.   
 
          
4.2. Compliance Impacts: 
(a) Small vehicle manufacturers: The rule will directly affect motor vehicle manufacturers.  
However, we believe that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on small vehicle 
manufacturers.  We believed that the small vehicle manufacturers are not likely to certify 
compliance with a vehicle test, but will use a combination of component testing by air bag 
suppliers and engineering judgment.  Already much of the air bag work for these small vehicle 
manufacturers is done by air bag suppliers.  Typically, air bag suppliers are supplying larger 
vehicle manufacturers during the development and phase-in period, and do not have the design 
capabilities to handle all of the smaller manufacturers.  The rulemaking proposal accounted for 
this limitation by proposing to allow small manufacturers that have limited lines to comply with 
the upgraded requirements at the end of the phase-in period, to reduce the economic impact of 
the rule on these small entities.   
 
We also believe that the rulemaking would not have a significant impact on the small vehicle 
manufacturers because the market for the vehicles produced by these entities is highly inelastic.  
Purchasers of these vehicles are attracted by the desire to have an unusual vehicle.  Further, all 
light vehicles must comply with the head form impact requirements.  Since the price of 
complying with the rule will likely be passed on to the final consumer, the price of competitor’s 
 IX- 7
models will increase by similar amounts.  In addition, we do not believe that raising the price of 
a vehicle to include the value of a rollover curtain air bag will have much, if any, effect on 
vehicle sales.   
 
For the reasons explained above, NHTSA concludes that this proposed rule will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small vehicle manufacturers.  
    
There are six small domestic motor vehicle manufacturers in the United States in MY 2007, as 
previously shown in Table IX-1.  All are small manufacturers, having much less than 1,000 
employees. 
 
If a vehicle is equipped with the ejection mitigation curtain air bag, the incremental cost to 
modify the FMVSS No. 214-curtain system is estimated to cost $49.97 per vehicle.  If a vehicle 
is equipped with a combo air bag system, the cost would be $208.31 per vehicle.  Compared to 
the least expensive vehicle in Table VIII-2, the cost is less than one-half of one percent 
($49.97/$25,000 = 0.2% for the curtain system and 0.8% for the combo system).  Compared to a 
weighted average sales price ($58,000), the cost is about one tenth of one percent 
($49.97/$58,000 = 0.1% for the curtain system and 0.3% for the combo system).   
 
We believe that the market for the products of these small manufacturers is highly inelastic.  
Purchasers of these products are enticed by the desire to have an unusual vehicle.  Furthermore, 
the price of competitors’ models will also need to be raised by a similar amount, since all light 
vehicles must pass the standards.  Thus, we do not believe that raising the price to include the 
 IX- 8
value of a rollover curtain air bag will have much, if any, affect of vehicle sales.  We suspect 
these price increases will be passed on to the final customer.  Based on this analysis, the agency 
believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on these four small 
domestic manufacturers.   
      
(b) Final stage manufacturers and alterers:   There are a significant number (several hundred) of 
second-stage or final-stage manufacturers and alterers that could be impacted by the proposed 
rule.  These manufacturers buy incomplete vehicles or add seating systems to vehicles without 
seats, or take out existing seats and add new seats.  Many of these vehicles are van conversions, 
but there are a variety of vehicles affected.  We believe that the majority of these incomplete 
vehicles would be equipped with the ejection mitigation curtain bag to meet the linear head form 
test requirements.  However, some incomplete vehicles were designed to meet the FMVSS No. 
214-oblique test requirements with the FMVSS No. 214-combination air bag.  In order to meet 
the proposed linear head form test requirements, these incomplete vehicles would be equipped 
with the ejection mitigation curtain bag.  When rollover curtain air bags are installed in the 
window header, these manufacturers may need to use the combined engineering judgment of the 
vehicle designer, curtain air bag supplier and their own judgment to certify compliance.  Possibly 
some exemplar tests could be performed to show compliance.  If a higher roof is added, the 
vehicle is excluded from the head form test.  If the side structure is not affected and a higher roof 
is not added, then the original manufacturer’s certification should apply.  Thus, while there are a 
significant number of second-stage and final stage manufacturers impacted by the proposed rule, 
we do not believe the impact will be economically significant.   
                                         
 IX- 9
(c) Air bag manufacturers and rollover sensor manufacturers: The agency does not believe that 
there are any small air bag manufacturers, and only a few small rollover sensor manufacturers.  
The proposed rule is expected to have a positive impact on their business. 
 
We expect additional business for air bag manufacturers and rollover sensor manufacturers.  The 
proposed rule will require the use of more air bags and rollover sensors.  In each case, the 
proposed rule means positive business for these manufacturers.   
  
5. An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, 
overlap, or conflict with the final rule   
We know of no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule. 
 
6. A description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the 
final rule on small entities. 
 
The only alternatives available for small entities relate to the leadtime phase-in discussed above.  
There are no other alternatives that can achieve the stated objectives without installing 
countermeasures into the vehicle.   
 
B. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) requires agencies to prepare a 
written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules that include 
a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditures by States, local or tribal governments, in 
 IX- 10
the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million annually (adjusted annually for 
inflation with base year of 1995).  Adjusting this amount by the implicit gross domestic product 
price deflator for the 2007 results in $130 million (119.816/92.106 = 1.30).  The assessment may 
be included in conjunction with other assessments, as it is here. 
 
A proposed rule on rollover curtain air bags is not likely to result in expenditures by State, local 
or tribal governments of more than $100 million annually.  However, it is estimated to result in 
the expenditure by automobile manufacturers and/or their suppliers of more than $583 million 
annually.  Since the estimated incremental costs depend on a variety of FMVSS No. 214 side air 
bags that manufacturers plan to install (in vehicles used as “baseline” for the cost estimate), the 
proposed rule have a variety of costs ranging from an average of at least $34 per vehicle for 17 
million vehicles, it will exceed $583 million.  The final cost will greatly depend on choices made 
by the automobile manufacturers to meet the FMVSS No. 214-oblique pole test requirements.  
These effects have been discussed in this Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis.  Please see 
Chapter V on Costs. 
 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires the agency to select the “least costly, most cost-
effective or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule.”   As an 
alternative, the agency considered a full-vehicle dynamic test to evaluate a curtain’s window 
coverage and retention capability.  Based on our experience on full-vehicle rollover crash tests 
(such as the vehicle rollover test specified in FMVSS No. 208), we determined that full-vehicle 
rollover crash tests can have an undesired amount of variability in vehicle and occupant 
kinematics.  Unlike full-vehicle rollover tests, the proposed component test is conducted in a 
 IX- 11
well controlled test environment, which results in an acceptable amount of variability.  In 
addition, the proposed component test not only distinguishes between acceptable and 
unacceptable performance in side curtain air bags, but has advantages over a full-vehicle 
dynamic test.  The acceptable performance in the laboratory test correlated to the acceptable 
performance in the dynamic test.  In other words, the agency’s component test was able to reveal 
deficiencies in window coverage of ejection mitigation curtains that resulted in partial or full 
ejections in dynamic conditions.  Therefore, we concluded that a full-vehicle test would not 
achieve the objectives of the rule.   
 
In addition, as discussed in Chapter VIII, the agency considered two alternative component tests.  
The first alternative is to require the front lower corner of the front side window area (test point 
A1) from meeting the displacement requirement when impacted at a 20 km/h.  The second 
alternative is to require a single impact at the center of the side window opening area.  For the 
first alternative, the agency undertook several research programs using a dynamic rollover 
fixture (DRF), which produced full-dummy ejection kinematics in an open window condition, to 
assess the potential effectiveness of ejection mitigation countermeasures in a rollover.  As part of 
the assessment, a series of tests on the DRF were performed using an unrestrained Hybrid III 6-
year- old dummy with two prototype inflatable devices namely “TRW” and “Zodiac” systems.  
In a series of tests with the dummy lying in a prone position (the dummy was placed on its back 
at the height of the bottom of the window opening), representing a near worst-case ejection 
condition, the dummy was completely ejected at the position near the bottom of the inflatable 
devices (above the sill) with the TRW curtain while the Zodiac system contained the dummy 
inside the test buck in all testing.  The Zodiac prototype system used an inflatable tubular 
 IX- 12
structure tethered near the base of the A- and B-pillars that deployed a woven material over the 
window opening.  The TRW prototype was more akin to a typical air bag curtain and was fixed 
to the A- and B-pillars at its end points and along the roof rail, but not tethered.  The test results 
showed that the window opening must be fully covered.  As for the second alternative, a curtain 
ejection mitigation system designed to meet the proposed displacement requirement at the center 
of the side window opening area would most likely have a gap between the curtain and the 
window sill.  Even if the gap is covered with the curtain, there is no assurance that the curtain 
would prevent ejections through the area without performing the headform test at targets in this 
area.  Therefore, the agency concluded that a curtain mitigation bag designed to meet the single 
impact would not achieve the objectives of the rule.

Number of Lives Saved by Ejection Mitigation System with 100% Observed Safety Belt Use 
Rate 
 
In order to determine the effect of the increase in belt use rate, first, we calculate the reduction in 
target population (i.e., the number of fatalities with 100% belt use rate).  After adjusting for the 
potential benefits of ESC and the 214-side curtain system, there are 1,392 observed fatalities in 
the target population.  According to the model developed by the agency, the use rate among 
potential fatal crashes (UPFC) would be 68% when the average observed usage rate is 82%, as 
shown below:256 
 
Table H-1

Safety belt effectiveness 78% 
Potential fatality 2,927 
Lives saved by belt 2,065 
 
Tables H-1 and H-2 show that additional 530 lives in the 1,392 observed fatal target population 
would be saved if the belt use rate increase by 18% from 82% to 100%.257  When the 530 lives 
saved are subtracted from the 1,392 fatalities in the target population, it results in 862 fatalities.  
In the draft PRIA, we estimated that the ejection mitigation system would save 402 lives among 
1,392 fatalities.  It resulted in an overall effectiveness of 29% (402/1,392 = 29%).  When the 
                                                          
256 The UPFC equation is from DOT HS 809 639, Table 10, Model 2 
257 2,065 lives saved by 100% belt use – 1,535 lives saved by 82% belt use = 530 net lives saved. 
H-2 
29% overall effectiveness was applied to the 862 fatalities, it resulted in 249 lives saved, as 
shown below: 
Table H-3 
Additional Lives Saved by Increase in Belt Use Rate 
Fatalities with 82% belt use rate 1,392 
Estimated additional lives saved with 82% belt use rate 402 
Overall ejection mitigation system effectiveness 29% 
Estimated fatalities with 100% belt use rate 862 
Estimated additional lives saved with 100% belt use rate 249 
     
In summary, if the belt use rate increases to 100%, the increase in belt use and the hypothetical 
ejection mitigation would save 779 lives.  Among the 779 lives saved, 530 would result from the 
increase in belt use rate and the remaining 249 would be from the ejection mitigation system, as 
shown in Table 6d. 
 
Table 6d shows that the number of lives saved by the ejection mitigation system would decrease 
from 402 to 249 lives with a 100% belt use rate.  In other words, an 18% increase in belt use rate 
would result in a 38% reduction in ejection mitigation fatal benefits.  The percentages show that 
seat belts are more effective than the ejection mitigation system in rollovers.    
 
Regarding belt use rate, we note that the reduction in fatal benefit was based on 100% observed 
belt use rate.  According to an agency study, belt use rate in actual fatal crashes is lower than the 
observed belt use for all occupants, as shown in Figure 1.258

Figure H-1. Observed belt use rate vs. Belt use rate among potential fatal crashes 
 
Figure H-1 shows that UPFC is not linear with respect to the observed belt use rate.  As a result, 
the potential benefits (in terms of lives saved and injuries prevented) would not be linear with 
respect to the observed belt use rate.  For example, Figure 1 shows that if the belt usage rate 
increases by 10% (from 0% to 10%), UPFC increases by 5% (from 0% to 5%).  However, if the 
use rate increases by the same percentage but from 90% to 100%, UPFC increases by 13%.  In 
other words, the last few percentage increases in seat belt use would be different from the first 
few percent increases. 
There are two important factors related to UPFC.  First, observed seat belt use is defined by our 
survey – which is during the daytime.  Nighttime belt use is much lower (about 18% lower based 
on police reported belt use in fatal crashes) than daytime use.  So, even though we say 100% 
observed seat belt use, it is only 91% in all fatal crashes (daytime and nighttime).  Second, the 
last group of people to buckle up (getting the last 10 percent of people between 90% and 100% 
belt use) are believed to be the biggest risk takers and are believed to be involved in more fatal 
crashes than the previous 10 percent, etc.  That is what we have found in analyzing crash data as 
H-4 
seat belt use has improved.  Those that were early adopters of seat belt use were good drivers 
that were involved in fatal crashes at a lower rate than average.  So, you get more benefit from 
belt use per percentage point increase for the last group.  NHTSA seeks comment on this 
curvelinear assumption, and whether the relationship is linear.  NHTSA also seeks comment on 
the calculation of lives saved from 100% seat belt use. 
In addition to the reduction in fatal benefits, the number of injuries prevented would also 
decrease from 310 to 192 (AIS 3-5) injuries.  When the 249 lives saved and 192 serious injuries 
prevented are converted into Equivalent Life Saved (ELS), it results in 230 and 183 ELS 
discounted at 3% and 7%, respectively, as shown below.

mitigation system 
Total lives saved 
82% used in PRIA N/A 402 402 
100% 530 249 779 
 
Table H-4 shows that the number of lives saved by the ejection mitigation system is relatively 
high even with 100% belt use.  There are a couple of reasons for the high number of lives saved.  
First, you still have 9% of unbelted fatalities occurring even with 100% daytime belt use.  The 
ejection mitigation system would prevent some of these fatalities.  Second, belt use doesn’t 
necessarily stop partial ejections.  The ejection mitigation system would prevent partial ejections 
in certain rollovers.    
Table H-5 shows that the net benefits would decrease from $1,217M with 82% belt use rate to 
$532M with 100% belt use rate, when all light vehicles are equipped with the proposed ejection 
mitigation system.

ELS Broken-Out by Belt Use and Level of Ejection 
 
The proposed ejection mitigation standard would save 402 lives and prevent 310 serious injuries 
annually.  When the lives saved and injuries prevented are converted into ELS and categorized 
by the level of ejection and belts use, it shows a total of 455, 371 and 295 ELS at no discount, 
3% discount and 7% discount, respectively.  Among the 455 ELS at no discount, 62 are from 
partially ejected belted occupants, 67 are from partially ejected unbelted occupants and the 
remaining 327 are from completely ejected unbelted occupants, as shown below in Table 8a.  
The net benefits at the various discount levels are given in Tables below.
