Energy Conservation Program: Energy 
Conservation Standards for Standby 
Mode and Off Mode for Microwave 
Ovens 
AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy, Department of 
Energy. 
ACTION: Supplemental Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (SNOPR) and 
public meeting. 
SUMMARY: The Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (EPCA) prescribes 
energy conservation standards for 
various consumer products and 
commercial and industrial equipment. 
Microwave ovens are covered products 
under EPCA, although there are no 
existing microwave oven standards. 
EPCA requires the U.S. Department of 
Energy (DOE) to determine whether 
amended, more stringent, standards are 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and would save 
a significant amount of energy. 
Additionally, the Energy Independence 
and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) 
amended EPCA to require any final rule 
adopted after July 1, 2010 establishing 
or revising energy conservation 
standards for covered products, 
including microwave ovens, to address 
standby mode and off mode energy use. 
On October 17, 2008, DOE issued a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) 
in which DOE proposed amendments to 
the energy conservation standards for 
several residential and commercial 
products, including microwave ovens. 
In response to the NOPR, DOE received 
comment expressing concern and 
encouraging the Department to re- 
examine standby mode and off mode of 
microwave ovens as a part of DOE’s 
rulemaking analyses. Additionally, DOE 
received comment alleging certain data 
problems affecting DOE’s rulemaking 
analyses. DOE’s preliminary assessment 
suggested that the concerns might be 
valid, thereby necessitating additional, 
supplemental rulemaking analyses. In 
this notice, DOE responds to the 
comments received on the NOPR and 
proposes amended energy conservation 
standards for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode. The notice also 
announces a public meeting to receive 
comment on these proposed standards 
and associated analyses and results. 
DATES: DOE will hold a public meeting 
on March 14, 2012, from 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m., in Washington, DC. The meeting 
will also be broadcast as a Webinar. See 
section VIII, ‘‘Public Participation,’’ for 
Webinar registration information, 
participant instructions, and 
information about the capabilities 
available to Webinar participants. 
DOE will accept comments, data, and 
information regarding this SNOPR 
before and after the public meeting, but 
no later than April 16, 2012. See section 
VIII, ‘‘Public Participation,’’ for details. 
ADDRESSES: The public meeting will be 
held at the U.S. Department of Energy, 
Forrestal Building, Room 8E–089, 1000

1 DOE considered energy use in off mode for 
microwave ovens, but is not proposing a maximum 
allowable off mode power because it is unaware of 
any current microwave ovens that are capable of 
operating in such a mode. 
2 DOE uses discount rates of 7 and 3 percent 
based on guidance from the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB Circular A–4, section E,

I. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
The Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq.; EPCA or the 
Act), as amended, provides that any 
amended energy conservation standard 
DOE prescribes for certain consumer 
products, such as microwave ovens, 
shall be designed to ‘‘achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency * * * which the Secretary 
determines is technologically feasible 
and economically justified.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A)) The new or amended 
standard must ‘‘result in significant 
conservation of energy.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B)) In accordance with these 
and other statutory provisions discussed 
in this notice, DOE proposes amended 
energy conservation standards for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode. The proposed standards, which 
prescribe the maximum allowable 
energy use when a product is in standby 
mode, are shown in Table I.1.1 These 
proposed standards, if adopted, would 
apply to all products listed in Table I.1 
and manufactured in, or imported into, 
the United States on or after April 1, 
2014. 
TABLE I.1—PROPOSED ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS FOR MICROWAVE OVEN STANDBY MODE AND OFF MODE 
[Compliance Starting in 2014] 
Product classes Proposed energy conservation standard 
Microwave-Only Ovens and Countertop Combination Microwave Ovens ........................................................ Maximum Standby Power = 1.0 
watt. 
Built-In and Over-the-Range Combination Microwave Ovens .......................................................................... Maximum Standby Power = 2.2 
watts. 
DOE’s analyses indicate that the 
proposed standards would save a 
significant amount of energy–an 
estimated 0.41 quads over 30 years 
(2014 through 2043). According to the 
Energy Information Administration’s 
(EIA’s) Annual Energy Outlook 2010 
(AEO 2010), total residential energy 
consumption is projected to be 21.3 
quads in 2015. The amount of energy 
saved per year is equivalent to 0.06 
percent of the projected household 
energy use. 
The cumulative national net present 
value (NPV) of total consumer costs and 
savings of the proposed standards for 
products shipped in 2014–2043, in 
2010$, ranges from $1.82 billion (at a 7- 
percent discount rate) to $3.59 billion 
(at a 3-percent discount rate).2 The NPV 
is the estimated total value of future 
operating-cost savings during the 
analysis period, minus the estimated 
increased product costs, discounted to 
2011. The industry net present value 
(INPV) is the sum of the discounted 
cash flows to the industry from the base

3 Results for NOX and Hg are presented in short 
tons. A metric ton is equivalent to 1.1 short tons. 
4 DOE calculates emissions reductions relative to 
the most recent version of the Annual Energy 
Outlook (AEO) Reference case forecast. This 
forecast accounts for emissions reductions from in- 
place regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate 
Rule (CAIR, 70 FR 25162 (May 12, 2005)), but not 
the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR, 70 FR 28606 
(May 18, 2005)). Subsequent regulations, including 
the Cross-State Air Pollution rule issued on July 6, 
2011, do not appear in the forecast at this time. 
5 DOE is aware of multiple agency efforts to 
determine the appropriate range of values used in 
evaluating the potential economic benefits of 
reduced Hg emissions. DOE has decided to await 
further guidance regarding consistent valuation and 
reporting of Hg emissions before it once again 
monetizes Hg in its rulemakings. 
6 DOE used a two-step calculation process to 
convert the time-series of costs and benefits into 
annualized values. First, DOE calculated a present 
value in the same year used for discounting the 
NPV of total consumer costs and savings. To 
calculate the present value, DOE used discount 
rates of 3 and 7 percent for all costs and benefits 
except for the value of CO2 reductions. For the 
latter, DOE used a range of discount rates, as shown 
in Table I.2. From the present value, DOE then 
calculated the corresponding time-series of fixed 
annual payments over a 30-year period starting in 
the same year used for discounting the NPV of total 
consumer costs and savings. The fixed annual 
payment is the annualized value. Although DOE 
calculated annualized values, this does not imply 
that the time-series of cost and benefits from which 
the annualized values were determined would be a 
steady stream of payments. 
year through the end of the analysis 
period (2014 to 2043). Using a real 
discount rate of 7.2 percent, DOE 
estimates that INPV for manufacturers of 
all microwave ovens in the base case is 
$1.1 billion in 2010$. If DOE adopts the 
proposed standard, it expects 
manufacturers will lose 4.7 to 6.5 
percent of their INPV, or approximately 
$52.9 million to $73.6 million. Using a 
7-percent discount rate, the NPV of 
consumer costs and savings from 
today’s proposed standards would 
amount to 25 to 34 times the total 
estimated industry losses. Using a 3- 
percent discount rate, the NPV would 
amount to 49 to 68 times the total 
estimated industry losses. 
The projected economic impacts of 
the proposed standards on individual 
consumers are positive. For example, for 
Microwave-Only and Countertop 
Combination Microwave Ovens 
(Product Class 1), the estimated average 
life-cycle cost (LCC) savings in 2010$ 
are $13, and all consumers of these 
products would have positive economic 
impacts. For Built-In and Over-the- 
Range Combination Microwave Ovens 
(Product Class 2), the estimated average 
LCC savings in 2010$ are $4, and most 
consumers of this product would have 
positive economic impacts. 
In addition, the proposed standards 
would have significant environmental 
benefits. The energy savings projected 
from the proposed standards would 
result in cumulative greenhouse gas 
emission reductions of 31.48 million 
metric tons (Mt) 3 of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) in 2014–2043. During this period, 
the proposed standards would result in 
emissions reductions of 25.6 tons of 
nitrogen oxides (NOX), and have a 
negligible impact on emissions of 
mercury (Hg).4 DOE estimates the 
present monetary value of the CO2 
emissions reduction is between $139 
million and $2,118 million, expressed 
in 2010$. DOE also estimates the 
present monetary value of the NOX 
emissions reduction, expressed in 
2010$, is between $3.82 million and 
$39.3 million at a 7-percent discount 
rate, and between $7.44 million and 
$76.4 million at a 3-percent discount 
rate.5 
The benefits and costs of today’s 
proposed standards can also be 
expressed in terms of annualized values 
over a 30-year period. The annualized 
monetary values are the sum of (1) the 
annualized national economic value of 
the benefits from operating products 
that meet the proposed standards 
(consisting primarily of operating cost 
savings from using less energy, minus 
increases in product purchase costs, 
which is another way of representing 
consumer NPV), and (2) the monetary 
value of the benefits of emission 
reductions, including CO2 emission 
reductions.6 The value of the CO2 
reductions, otherwise known as the 
Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), is 
calculated using a range of values per 
metric ton of CO2 developed by a recent 
interagency process. The monetary costs 
and benefits of cumulative emissions 
reductions are reported in 2010$ to 
permit comparisons with the other costs 
and benefits in the same dollar units. 
The derivation of the SCC values is 
discussed in section IV.K. 
Although combining the values of 
operating savings and CO2 reductions 
provides a useful perspective, two 
issues should be considered. First, the 
national operating savings are domestic 
U.S. consumer monetary savings that 
occur as a result of market transactions, 
whereas the value of CO2 reductions is 
based on a global value. Second, the 
assessments of operating cost savings 
and CO2 savings are performed with 
different methods that use different time 
frames for analysis. The national 
operating cost savings is measured for 
the lifetime of microwave ovens 
shipped in 2014–2043. The SCC values, 
on the other hand, reflect the present 
value of all future climate-related 
impacts resulting from the emission of 
one ton of CO2 in each year. These 
impacts continue well beyond 2100. 
Table I.2 shows the annualized values 
for today’s proposed standards, 
expressed in 2010$. The results under 
the primary estimate are as follows. 
Using a 7-percent discount rate for 
benefits and costs other than CO2 
reductions, for which DOE used a 3- 
percent discount rate along with the 
SCC series corresponding to a value of 
$22.3/ton in 2010, the cost of the 
standards proposed in today’s rule is 
$20.3 million per year in increased 
product costs, while the annualized 
benefits are $167 million in reduced 
product operating costs, $35.4 million 
in CO2 reductions, and $1.74 million in 
reduced NOX emissions. In this case, the 
net benefit amounts to $184 million per 
year. Using a 3-percent discount rate for 
all benefits and costs and the SCC series 
corresponding to a value of $22.3/ton in 
2010, the cost of the standards proposed 
in today’s rule is $21.6 million per year 
in increased product costs, while the 
annualized benefits are $205 million in 
reduced operating costs, $35.4 million 
in CO2 reductions, and $2.14 million in 
reduced NOX emissions. In this case, the 
net benefit amounts to $221 million per 
year.

8529 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
7 Products in the Microwave-Only Ovens and 
Countertop Combination Microwave Ovens product 
class that meet the proposed standards are currently 
commercially available. The Built-In and Over-the- 
Range Combination Microwave Ovens class does 
not currently comprise products that meet the 
proposed standards, primarily because of the larger 
components necessary for the convection system 
and the more complex displays. However, DOE 
believes it is technologically feasible for all 
microwave ovens to meet the proposed standards.

U.S. Code, Part B was redesignated Part A.

* The Primary, Benefits, and High Benefits Estimates utilize forecasts of energy prices and housing starts from the AEO2010 Reference case, 
Low Economic Growth case, and High Economic Growth case, respectively. In addition, incremental product costs reflect a declining trend (de-
fault learning rate) for product prices in the Primary Estimate, constant prices (no learning rate) for product prices in the Low Estimate, and a de-
clining trend (high learning rate) in the High Estimate. The derivation and application of learning rates for product prices is explained in section 
IV.D.1. 
** The CO2 values represent global values (in 2010$) of the social cost of CO2 emissions in 2010 under several scenarios. The values of $4.9, $22.3, and $36.5 per ton are the averages of SCC distributions calculated using 5-percent, 3-percent, and 2.5-percent discount rates, respec-
tively. The value of $67.6 per ton represents the 95th percentile of the SCC distribution calculated using a 3-percent discount rate. The value for 
NOX (in 2010$) is the average of the low and high values used in DOE’s analysis. 
† Total Benefits for both the 3-percent and 7-percent cases are derived using the SCC value calculated at a 3-percent discount rate, which is 
$22.3/ton in 2010 (in 2010$). In the rows labeled as ‘‘7% plus CO2 range’’ and ‘‘3% plus CO2 range,’’ the operating cost and NOX benefits are 
calculated using the labeled discount rate, and those values are added to the full range of CO2 values. 
DOE has made an initial 
determination that the proposed 
standards represent the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified, while 
maintaining product utility in the form 
of a continual clock display, and would 
result in the significant conservation of 
energy. DOE further notes that products 
achieving these standard levels are 
already commercially available for one 
of the product classes covered by 
today’s proposal.7 Based on the analyses 
described above, DOE found the benefits 
of the proposed standards to the Nation 
(energy savings, positive NPV of 
consumer benefits, consumer LCC 
savings, and emission reductions) 
outweigh the burdens (loss of INPV for 
manufacturers). 
Based on consideration of the public 
comments DOE receives in response to 
this supplemental notice and related 
information collected and analyzed 
during the course of this rulemaking 
effort, DOE may adopt energy use levels 
presented in this notice that are either 
higher or lower than the proposed 
standards, or some combination of 
level(s) that incorporate the proposed 
standards in part. In particular, DOE is 
proposing TSL 3 for built-in products as 
the level which it has tentatively 
concluded meet the applicable statutory 
criteria (i.e., the highest level that is 
technologically feasible, economically 
justified, and would result in significant 
conservation of energy). Based upon 
public comments and any 
accompanying data submissions, DOE 
would consider finalizing other TSLs (as 
presented in this NOPR or at some level 
in between), including the option of not 
finalizing the standard for built-ins 
proposed in this rule. Accordingly, DOE 
is presenting a variety of issues 
throughout today’s notice upon which it 
is seeking comment, which will bear 
upon its consideration of standards for 
built-ins in the final rule. 
II. Introduction 
The following section briefly 
discusses the statutory authority 
underlying today’s proposal as well as 
some of the relevant historical 
background related to the establishment 
of energy conservation standards for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode. 
A. Authority 
Title III of EPCA sets forth various 
provisions designed to improve energy 
efficiency. Part B of Title III (42 U.S.C. 
6291–6309) provides for the Energy 
Conservation Program for Consumer 
Products Other Than Automobiles.8 
EPCA covers consumer products and 
certain commercial equipment (referred 
to collectively hereafter as ‘‘covered 
products’’), including the microwave

9 DOE notes that under 42 U.S.C. 6295(m), the 
agency must periodically review its already 
established energy conservation standards for a 
covered product. Under this requirement, the next 
review that DOE would need to conduct would 
occur no later than 6 years from the issuance of a 
final rule establishing or amending a standard for 
a covered product. 
ovens that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. (42 U.S.C. 6292(a)(10)) 9 
Under the Act, DOE’s energy 
conservation program for covered 
products consists essentially of four 
parts: (1) Testing, (2) labeling, (3) the 
establishment of Federal energy 
conservation standards, and (4) 
certification and enforcement 
procedures. The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) is primarily 
responsible for labeling, and DOE 
implements the rest of the program. 
Section 323 of the Act authorizes DOE, 
subject to certain criteria and 
conditions, to develop test procedures 
to measure the energy efficiency, energy 
use, or estimated annual operating cost 
of each covered product. (42 U.S.C. 
6293) The National Appliance Energy 
Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), 
Public Law 100–12, amended EPCA to 
establish prescriptive standards for 
cooking products, specifically gas 
cooking products. No standards were 
established for microwave ovens. 
Manufacturers of covered products must 
use the prescribed DOE test procedure 
as the basis for certifying to DOE that 
their products comply with the 
applicable energy conservation 
standards adopted under EPCA (42 
U.S.C. 6295(s)) and when making 
representations to the public regarding 
the energy use or efficiency of those 
products. (42 U.S.C. 6293(c)) Similarly, 
DOE must use these test procedures to 
determine whether the products comply 
with standards adopted under EPCA. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(s)) The test procedure 
for microwave ovens currently appears 
at title 10, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), part 430, subpart B, appendix I. 
EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 
amended standards for covered 
products. As indicated above, any 
amended standard for a covered product 
must be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)) Furthermore, 
EPCA precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard for certain products, including 
microwave ovens, if no test procedure 
has been established for the product. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(A)) Moreover, DOE 
may not prescribe a standard: (1) If it 
would not result in the significant 
conservation of energy, or (2) if DOE 
determines by rule that the proposed 
standard is not technologically feasible 
or economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B)) The Act also provides 
that, in deciding whether a proposed 
standard is economically justified, DOE 
must determine whether the benefits of 
the standard exceed its burdens. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) DOE must do so 
after receiving comments on the 
proposed standard, and by considering, 
to the greatest extent practicable, the 
following seven factors: 
1. The economic impact of the 
standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the products subject to the 
standard; 
2. The savings in operating costs 
throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered products in the type (or 
class) compared to any increase in the 
price, initial charges, or maintenance 
expenses for the covered products that 
are likely to result from the imposition 
of the standard; 
3. The total projected amount of 
energy, or as applicable, water, savings 
likely to result directly from the 
imposition of the standard; 
4. Any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of the covered products 
likely to result from the imposition of 
the standard; 
5. The impact of any lessening of 
competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 
6. The need for national energy and 
water conservation; and 
7. Other factors the Secretary of 
Energy (Secretary) considers relevant. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) 
EPCA also contains what is known as 
an ‘‘anti-backsliding’’ provision, which 
prevents the Secretary from prescribing 
any amended standard that either 
increases the maximum allowable 
energy use or decreases the minimum 
required energy efficiency of a covered 
product. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(1)) Also, the 
Secretary may not prescribe an amended 
or new standard if the Secretary finds 
that interested persons have established 
by a preponderance of the evidence that 
the standard is likely to result in the 
unavailability in the United States of 
any covered product type (or class) of 
performance characteristics (including 
reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the 
same as those generally available in the 
United States at the time of the 
Secretary’s finding. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4)) 
Further, EPCA establishes a rebuttable 
presumption that a standard is 
economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy savings 
during the first year that the consumer 
will receive as a result of the standard, 
as calculated under the applicable test 
procedure. See 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii). 
Additionally, 42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(1) 
specifies requirements when 
promulgating a standard for a type or 
class of covered product that has two or 
more subcategories. DOE must specify a 
different standard level than that which 
applies generally to such type or class 
of products for any group of covered 
products which have the same function 
or intended use, if products within such 
group—(A) consume a different kind of 
energy from that consumed by other 
covered products within such type (or 
class); or (B) have a capacity or other 
performance-related feature which other 
products within such type (or class) do 
not have and such feature justifies a 
higher or lower standard than applies or 
will apply to the other products within 
that type or class. Id. In determining 
whether a performance-related feature 
justifies a different standard for a group 
of products, DOE must consider such 
factors as the utility to the consumer of 
such a feature and other factors DOE 
deems appropriate. Id. Any rule 
prescribing such a standard must 
include an explanation of the basis on 
which such higher or lower level was 
established. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(2)) 
Federal energy conservation 
requirements generally supersede State 
laws or regulations concerning energy 
conservation testing, labeling, and 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6297(a)–(c)) DOE 
can, however, grant waivers of Federal 
preemption for particular State laws or 
regulations, in accordance with the 
procedures and other provisions of 
section 327(d) of the Act. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)) 
Finally, section 310(3) of the Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 2007 
(EISA 2007; Pub. L. 110–140) amended 
EPCA to require that energy 
conservation standards address standby 
mode and off mode energy use. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(gg)) Specifically, when DOE 
adopts a standard for a covered product 
after July 1, 2010, it must, pursuant to 
criteria for adoption of standards at 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o), incorporate standby 
mode and off mode energy use into the 
standard, if feasible, or adopt a separate 
standard for such energy use for that 
product. (42 U.S.C. 6295(gg)(3)) These 
provisions in EISA 2007 do not 
preclude DOE from considering 
standards for standby mode and off 
mode energy use in a rulemaking that 
does not consider standards for active

site at: www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/

mode energy use. In this rulemaking, 
DOE intends to incorporate standby 
mode and off mode energy use into any 
standard it adopts in the final rule. 
It is pursuant to the authority set forth 
above that DOE is conducting the 
present SNOPR rulemaking for standby 
mode and off mode electricity 
consumption of microwave ovens. 
DOE has also reviewed this regulation 
pursuant to Executive Order 13563. (76 
FR 3281, Jan. 21, 2011). Executive Order 
13563 is supplemental to and explicitly 
reaffirms the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing regulatory review 
established in Executive Order 12866. 
To the extent permitted by law, agencies 
are required by Executive Order 13563 
to: (1) Propose or adopt a regulation 
only upon a reasoned determination 
that its benefits justify its costs 
(recognizing that some benefits and 
costs are difficult to quantify); (2) tailor 
regulations to impose the least burden 
on society, consistent with obtaining 
regulatory objectives, taking into 
account, among other things, and to the 
extent practicable, the costs of 
cumulative regulations; (3) select, in 
choosing among alternative regulatory 
approaches, those approaches that 
maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, 
public health and safety, and other 
advantages; distributive impacts; and 
equity); (4) to the extent feasible, specify 
performance objectives, rather than 
specifying the behavior or manner of 
compliance that regulated entities must 
adopt; and (5) identify and assess 
available alternatives to direct 
regulation, including providing 
economic incentives to encourage the 
desired behavior, such as user fees or 
marketable permits, or providing 
information upon which choices can be 
made by the public. 
DOE emphasizes as well that 
Executive Order 13563 requires agencies 
‘‘to use the best available techniques to 
quantify anticipated present and future 
benefits and costs as accurately as 
possible.’’ In its guidance, the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) has emphasized that such 
techniques may include ‘‘identifying 
changing future compliance costs that 
might result from technological 
innovation or anticipated behavioral 
changes.’’ For the reasons stated in the 
preamble, DOE believes that today’s 
proposed rule is consistent with these 
principles, including the requirement 
that, to the extent permitted by law, 
benefits justify costs and that net 
benefits are maximized. Consistent with 
Executive Order 13563, and the range of 
impacts analyzed in this rulemaking, 
the energy efficiency standards 
proposed herein by DOE achieve 
maximum net benefits. 
B. Background 
1. Current Standards 
Section 310 of EISA 2007 amends 
section 325 of EPCA to require DOE to 
regulate standby mode and off mode 
energy use for all covered products, 
including microwave ovens, as part of 
energy conservation standards for which 
a final rule is adopted after July 10, 
2010. (42 U.S.C. 6295(gg)(3)(A)) 
Based on its ongoing analyses and 
comments from interested parties, DOE 
decided not to amend energy 
conservation standards for microwave 
oven energy factor (microwave oven 
operation in active mode), but instead 
develop a separate energy use metric for 
standby mode and off mode. 74 FR 
16040 (Apr. 8, 2009). 
2. History of Standards Rulemaking for 
Microwave Ovens 
On March 15, 2006, DOE published 
on its Web site a document titled, 
‘‘Rulemaking Framework for 
Commercial Clothes Washers and 
Residential Dishwashers, 
Dehumidifiers, and Cooking Products’’ 
(Framework Document).10 71 FR 15059. 
The Framework Document described 
the procedural and analytical 
approaches that DOE anticipated using 
to evaluate energy conservation 
standards for these products, and 
identified various issues to be resolved 
in conducting the rulemaking. On 
December 4, 2006, DOE posted on its 
Web site two spreadsheet tools for this 
rulemaking.11 The first tool calculates 
life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback 
periods (PBPs). The second tool—the 
national impact analysis (NIA) 
spreadsheet—calculates the impacts on 
shipments and the national energy 
savings (NES) and NPV at various 
candidate standard levels. DOE 
subsequently published the advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANOPR) 
for this rulemaking (72 FR 64432 (Nov. 
15, 2007), the November 2007 ANOPR) 
and on December 13, 2007, held a 
public meeting to present and seek 
comment on the analytical methodology 
and results in the ANOPR (the 
December 2007 Public Meeting). 
At the December 2007 Public Meeting, 
DOE invited comment in particular on 
the following issues concerning 
microwave ovens: (1) Incorporation of 
the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) test standard IEC 
Standard 62301 12 into DOE’s 
microwave oven test procedure to 
measure standby mode and off mode 
power; (2) IEC Standard 62301 test 
conditions; and (3) a requirement that if 
the measured standby mode power 
varies as a function of the time 
displayed, the standby mode power test 
would run for 12 hours, with an initial 
clock setting of 12:00. 
Interested parties’ comments 
presented during the December 2007 
Public Meeting and submitted in 
response to the November 2007 ANOPR 
addressed the standby mode and off 
mode energy use of microwave ovens 
and the ability to combine that energy 
use into a single metric with cooking 
energy use. Those concerns lead DOE to 
thoroughly investigate standby mode, 
off mode, and active mode power 
consumption of microwave ovens. 
On October 17, 2008, DOE published 
a NOPR (the October 2008 NOPR) for 
cooking products and commercial 
clothes washers in the Federal Register 
proposing amended energy conservation 
standards. 73 FR 62034. In the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE tentatively concluded 
that a standard for microwave oven 
standby mode and off mode energy use 
would be technologically feasible and 
economically justified. Id. at 62120. 
Therefore, concurrent with the 
standards NOPR, DOE published in the 
Federal Register a test procedure NOPR 
for microwave ovens to incorporate a 
measurement of standby mode and off 
mode power and to consider inclusion 
of such power as part of the energy 
conservation standards rulemaking. 73 
FR 62134 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
In conjunction with the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE posted on its Web site the 
associated technical support document 
(TSD). The TSD included the results of 
DOE’s analyses, including: (1) The 
market and technology assessment, (2) 
screening analysis, (3) engineering 
analysis, (4) energy and water use 
determination, (5) markups analysis to 
determine product price, (6) LCC and 
PBP analyses, (7) shipments analysis, (8) 
NES and NIA, and (9) manufacturer 
impact analysis (MIA). The engineering 
analysis spreadsheet, the LCC 
spreadsheets, the national and regional 
impact analysis spreadsheets, and the 
MIA spreadsheet were all made 
available at www.eere.energy.gov/ 
buildings/appliancelstandards/ 
commercial/clotheslwashers.html.

8532 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
13 A notation in the form ‘‘Whirlpool, No. 50 at 
p. 2’’ identifies a written comment that DOE has 
received and has included in the docket of the 
standards rulemaking for microwave ovens (Docket 
No. EE–2006–STD–0127). This particular notation 
refers to a comment (1) submitted by Whirlpool, (2) 
recorded in document number 50 in the docket of 
this rulemaking, and (3) which appears on page 2 
of document number 50. A notation in the form 
‘‘Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
p. 63’’ identifies an oral comment that DOE 
received during the November 13, 2008 NOPR 
public meeting and which was recorded in the 
public meeting transcript in the docket for this 
rulemaking (Docket No. EE–2006–STD–0127), 
available on www.regulations.gov. This particular 
notation refers to a comment (1) made by Whirlpool 
during the public meeting, (2) recorded in 
document number 40.5, which is the public 
meeting transcript that is filed in the docket of this 
rulemaking, and (3) which appears on page 63 of 
document number 40.5. 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
concluded based on its additional 
investigations that, ‘‘although it may be 
mathematically possible to combine 
energy consumption into a single metric 
encompassing active (cooking), standby, 
and off modes, it is not technically 
feasible to do so at this time * * *.’’ 73 
FR 62034, 62043 (Oct. 17, 2008). The 
separate prescriptive standby mode and 
off mode energy conservation standards 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR for 
microwave ovens were as shown in 
Table II.1. 
TABLE II.1—OCTOBER 2008 NOPR PROPOSED ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS FOR MICROWAVE OVEN STANDBY 
MODE AND OFF MODE 
Product class Proposed energy conservation standard 
Microwave Ovens ............................................................................................................................................... Maximum Standby Power = 1.0 
watt 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
described and sought further comment 
on the analytical framework, models, 
and tools (e.g., LCC and NIA 
spreadsheets) it was using to analyze the 
impacts of energy conservation 
standards for this product. DOE held a 
public meeting in Washington, DC, on 
November 13, 2008 (the November 2008 
Public Meeting), to present the 
methodologies and results for the 
October 2008 NOPR analyses. 
Multiple interested parties 
commented in response to the October 
2008 NOPR that insufficient data and 
information were available to complete 
this rulemaking, and requested that it be 
postponed to allow DOE to gather such 
inputs on which to base its analysis. 
Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) 
commented that DOE should work with 
industry to gather comprehensive data. 
Whirlpool stated that DOE and industry 
must ensure the product is useful to the 
consumer at the standards adopted, 
which could mean delaying standards 
until the next round of rulemaking. 
(Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 2; Whirlpool, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 
63) 13 GE Consumer & Industrial (GE) 
stated that DOE’s approach could have 
important implications for how standby 
power is approached for other covered 
products, and thus it is essential that 
DOE take the time to address these 
issues. GE commented that DOE should 
postpone the microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode energy conservation 
standards rulemaking to allow standby 
power issues for covered products to be 
addressed either through negotiation or 
through a rulemaking that considers 
how the definition of standby power 
would affect all appliances, not just 
microwave ovens. GE further 
commented that if the microwave oven 
standby mode and off mode energy 
conservation standards rulemaking was 
not postponed, DOE should issue a ‘‘no 
standard’’ standard for microwave oven 
standby power. (GE, No. 48, at pp. 2, 4) 
DOE agreed with these commenters 
that additional information would 
improve its analysis and, in April 2009, 
it concluded that it should defer a 
decision regarding amended energy 
conservation standards for standby 
mode and off mode energy use for 
microwave ovens pending further 
rulemaking. FR 16040, 16042 (Apr. 8, 
2009). In the interim, DOE proceeded 
with consideration of energy 
conservation standards for microwave 
oven active mode energy use based on 
its proposals in the October 2008 NOPR, 
and its analysis determined that no new 
standards for microwave oven active 
mode (as to cooking efficiency) were 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified. Therefore, in a 
final rule published on April 8, 2009, 
DOE maintained the ‘‘no standard’’ 
standard for microwave oven active 
mode energy use. Id. at 16087. The final 
rule is available on DOE’s Web site at: 
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliancelstandards/residential/pdfs/ 
74fr16040.pdf. 
After continuing its analysis of 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode through additional testing, 
research, and consideration of an 
updated version of IEC Standard 62301, 
DOE developed this SNOPR to enable 
interested parties to comment on the 
revised standby power levels proposed 
for microwave oven standby mode and 
off mode energy use. 
The effective date of any new energy 
conservation standards for this product 
would be 3 years after the final rule is 
published in the Federal Register. 
III. General Discussion 
A. Test Procedures 
The test procedures for cooking 
products including microwave ovens 
initially appeared at 10 CFR part 430, 
subpart B, appendix I. Those test 
procedures were part of a May 10, 1978 
final rule that first established test 
procedures for conventional ranges, 
cooktops, and ovens (including 
microwave ovens). 43 FR 20108. DOE 
later revised its test procedures for 
cooking products to measure their 
efficiency and energy use more 
accurately, publishing a final rule on 
October 3, 1997. 62 FR 51976. The 1997 
rule incorporated parts of IEC Standard 
705–1998 and Amendment 2–1993, 
‘‘Methods for Measuring the 
Performance of Microwave Ovens for 
Households and Similar Purposes.’’ It 
measured microwave oven cooking 
efficiency, but did not address energy 
use in the standby mode or off mode. 
Section 310 of EISA 2007 amended 
EPCA to require DOE to amend the test 
procedures for covered products to 
address energy consumption of standby 
mode and off mode. If technically 
infeasible, DOE must prescribe a 
separate standby mode and off mode 
energy use test procedure. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(gg)(2)(A)) 
As discussed previously, DOE 
published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in October 2008 to amend 
the microwave oven test procedure to 
provide for measuring standby mode 
and off mode power consumption, (73 
FR 62134 (Oct. 17, 2008)) and held a 
public meeting on the proposed 
rulemaking on November 14, 2008. DOE 
received comments from interested 
parties both in written responses to the 
October 2008 NOPR and at the 
November 2008 Public Meeting.

8533 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
14 As noted previously, DOE is unaware of any 
microwave ovens currently available that can 
operate in off mode. Therefore, efficiency levels for 
the purposes of evaluating standby mode and off 
mode energy use in microwave ovens are defined 
on the basis of standby power only. 
After considering stakeholder 
comments and additional information, 
DOE issued an SNOPR for the test 
procedure for measuring microwave 
oven standby mode and off mode power 
consumption. 75 FR 42612 (July 22, 
2010). In that SNOPR, DOE proposed 
adopting definitions of modes based on 
relevant provisions from IEC Standard 
62301 Second Edition, Committee Draft 
for Vote (IEC Standard 62301 CDV), as 
well as language to clarify application of 
those provisions for measuring 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode power consumption. Id. Also on 
July 22, 2010, DOE issued a repeal final 
rule (the July 2010 TP Final Rule) 
eliminating the active mode cooking 
efficiency provisions in the microwave 
oven test procedure after it determined 
that those provisions did not produce 
accurate and repeatable results. 75 FR 
42579. DOE held a public meeting on 
September 16, 2010, and accepted 
comments, data, and information 
regarding the test procedure SNOPR no 
later than October 4, 2010. DOE also 
invited inputs on microwave active 
mode test procedures for a potential 
new test procedure rulemaking. After 
consideration of these comments, an 
interim final rule for a microwave oven 
test procedure addressing standby mode 
and off mode power was published in 
the Federal Register on March 9, 2011 
(the March 2011 TP Interim Final Rule). 
76 FR 12825. DOE provided a 180-day 
comment period on the March 2011 TP 
Interim Final Rule, during which it 
received several comments on potential 
improvements to the microwave oven 
test procedure recently adopted. DOE is 
currently considering these comments, 
but does not believe that any of the 
suggested amendments would impact 
the analysis in today’s notice. 
B. Technological Feasibility 
1. General 
DOE considers a design option to be 
technologically feasible if it is in use by 
the associated industry or if research 
has progressed to development of a 
working prototype. In each standards 
rulemaking, therefore, DOE conducts a 
screening analysis, based on 
information it has gathered regarding 
existing technology options and 
prototype designs. In consultation with 
manufacturers, design engineers, and 
other stakeholders, DOE develops a list 
of design options for consideration in 
the rulemaking. After DOE determines 
that particular design options are 
technologically feasible, the first of the 
screening criteria, it evaluates each 
option in light of the following three 
additional criteria: (a) Practicability to 
manufacture, install, and service; (b) 
adverse impacts on product utility or 
availability; and (c) adverse impacts on 
health or safety. 10 CFR part 430, 
subpart C, appendix A, section 4(a)(3) 
and (4). All technologically feasible 
design options that pass the three 
additional screening criteria are 
candidates for further assessment in the 
engineering and subsequent analyses in 
the NOPR stage. DOE may amend the 
list of retained design options in SNOPR 
analyses based on comments received 
on the NOPR and on further research. 
DOE published a list of evaluated 
microwave oven technologies in the 
November 2007 ANOPR. 72 FR 64432 
(Nov. 15, 2007). DOE identified lower- 
power display technologies, improved 
power supplies and controllers, and 
alternative cooking sensor technologies 
as options to reduce standby power. 
DOE conducted this research when it 
became aware of the likelihood of EISA 
2007 being signed, which DOE 
understood was to contain provisions 
pertaining to standby mode and off 
mode energy use. Therefore, DOE 
presented details of each design option 
to stakeholders at the December 2007 
Public Meeting even though the results 
were not available in time for 
publication in the November 2007 
ANOPR. DOE believes all of these 
options are technologically feasible, and 
in the ANOPR invited comment on 
technology options that reduce standby 
power in microwave ovens. 72 FR 
64432, 64513 (Nov. 15, 2007). For more 
details of these technology options and 
stakeholder comments, see section IV.B 
of this notice. 
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible 
Levels 
When DOE proposes to adopt, or to 
decline to adopt, an amended or new 
standard for a type (or class) of product 
such as microwave ovens, it must 
‘‘determine the maximum improvement 
in energy efficiency or maximum 
reduction in energy use that is 
technologically feasible’’ for such a 
product. (42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(1)) Using 
the design parameters that lead to 
creation of the highest available product 
efficiencies, in the engineering analysis 
DOE determined the maximum 
technologically feasible (‘‘max-tech’’) 
standby power levels 14 for microwave 
ovens, as shown in Table III.1. (See 
chapter 3 in the SNOPR TSD.) The max- 
tech microwave oven standby power 
level corresponds to a unit equipped 
with a default automatic power-down 
function that shuts off certain power- 
consuming components after a specified 
period of user inactivity. The max-tech 
microwave oven standby power level 
was determined in the October 2008 
NOPR to be 0.02 watts (W). 73 FR 62052 
(Oct. 17, 2008). Based upon additional 
analyses for today’s SNOPR, DOE is 
proposing that this max-tech level 
applies to the product class of 
microwave-only ovens and countertop 
combination microwave ovens. For 
built-in and over-the-range combination 
microwave ovens, DOE proposes, based 
on its analysis, a max-tech standby 
power level of 0.04 W. For more details 
of the max-tech levels and stakeholder 
comments, see section IV.C of this 
notice.

C. Energy Savings 
1. Determination of Energy Savings 
DOE used its NIA spreadsheet tool to 
estimate energy savings from amended 
standards for standby mode and off 
mode energy use for microwave ovens. 
(Section IV.E of today’s supplemental 
notice and chapter 10 of the SNOPR 
TSD describe the NIA spreadsheet 
model.) DOE forecasted energy savings 
throughout the period of analysis 
(beginning in 2014, the year that 
amended standards would go into effect, 
and ending in 2043) for each TSL,

8534 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
relative to the base case, which 
represents the forecast of energy 
consumption in the absence of amended 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
quantified the energy savings 
attributable to amended energy 
conservation standards as the difference 
in energy consumption between each 
standards case and the base case. The 
base case incorporates market demand 
for more efficient products. 
The NIA spreadsheet tool calculates 
the electricity savings in ‘‘site energy’’ 
expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Site 
energy is the energy consumed directly 
on location by an individual product. 
DOE reports national energy savings on 
an annual basis in terms of the 
aggregated source energy savings, which 
is the savings in energy used to generate 
and transmit the energy consumed at 
the site. To convert site energy to source 
energy, DOE derived conversion factors, 
which change with time, from the AEO 
2010. (See SNOPR TSD chapter 10 for 
further details.) 
2. Significance of Savings 
EPCA, as amended, prohibits DOE 
from adopting a standard for a product 
if that standard would not result in 
‘‘significant’’ energy savings. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B)) Although EPCA does not 
define the term ‘‘significant,’’ the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit, in Natural Resources 
Defense Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 
1355, 1373 (DC Cir. 1985), indicated 
that Congress intended ‘‘significant’’ 
energy savings in this context to be 
savings that were not ‘‘genuinely 
trivial.’’ The energy savings for energy 
conservation standards at the TSL 
considered in this rulemaking are 
nontrivial, and, therefore, DOE 
considers them ‘‘significant’’ within the 
meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B). 
D. Economic Justification 
1. Specific Criteria 
As noted earlier, EPCA provides 
seven factors to be evaluated in 
determining whether an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)) The 
following sections describe how DOE 
has addressed each of those seven 
factors in this rulemaking. 
a. Economic Impacts on Manufacturers 
and Consumers 
In determining the impacts of an 
amended standard on manufacturers, 
DOE first determines the quantitative 
impacts using an annual cash-flow 
approach. This step includes both a 
short-term assessment—based on the 
cost and capital requirements during the 
period between the issuance of a 
regulation and when entities must 
comply with the regulation—and a long- 
term assessment over a 30-year analysis 
period. The industry-wide impacts 
analyzed include INPV (which values 
the industry on the basis of expected 
future cash flows), cash flows by year, 
changes in revenue and income, and 
other measures of impact, as 
appropriate. Second, DOE analyzes and 
reports the impacts on different types of 
manufacturers, paying particular 
attention to impacts on small 
manufacturers. Third, DOE considers 
the impact of standards on domestic 
manufacturer employment and 
manufacturing capacity, as well as the 
potential for standards to result in plant 
closures and loss of capital investment. 
Finally, DOE takes into account 
cumulative impacts of different DOE 
regulations and other regulatory 
requirements on manufacturers. For 
more details on the MIA, see section 
IV.G and chapter 12 of the SNOPR TSD. 
For consumers, measures of economic 
impact include the changes in life-cycle 
cost (LCC) and payback period for the 
product at each TSL. Under EPCA, the 
LCC is one of seven factors to be 
considered in determining economic 
justification. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(II)) It is discussed in 
detail in the following section. 
b. Life-Cycle Cost 
The LCC is the sum of the purchase 
price of product (including any 
installation) and the operating expense 
(including energy and maintenance 
expenditures), discounted over the 
lifetime of the product. 
In this rulemaking, DOE calculated 
both LCC and LCC savings for various 
power consumption levels in standby 
and off modes. DOE established the 
variability and uncertainty in energy use 
by defining the uncertainty and 
variability in the standby and off modes 
(hours per day) of the product. The 
variability in energy prices was 
characterized by use of regional energy 
prices. To account for uncertainty and 
variability in other inputs, such as 
product lifetime and discount rate, DOE 
used a distribution of values with 
probabilities attached to each value. For 
each consumer with a microwave oven, 
DOE sampled the values of those inputs 
from the probability distributions. 
DOE’s analysis produced a range of 
LCCs. In addition to providing the 
average LCC savings or average payback 
for a standard, this approach enables 
DOE to identify the percentage of 
consumers achieving LCC savings or 
attaining certain payback values due to 
an energy conservation standard. DOE 
presents the LCC savings as a 
distribution, with a mean value and a 
range. In the analysis prepared for the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE assumed that 
consumers will purchase the product in 
2012. For today’s SNOPR, that 
assumption has been changed to 2014, 
as this is the expected first year of 
compliance. See section IV.D for more 
details on the LCC and PBP analysis. 
c. Energy Savings 
Significant conservation of energy is a 
separate statutory requirement for 
imposing an energy conservation 
standard. Additionally, EPCA requires 
DOE, in determining the economic 
justification of a proposed standard, to 
consider the total energy savings that 
are projected to result directly from a 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III)) 
As noted in the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE used the NIA spreadsheet to 
estimate total energy savings 
attributable to the considered standard 
levels. 73 FR 62034, 62046 (Oct. 17, 
2008). See section IV.E and chapter 10 
of the SNOPR TSD for more details on 
this analysis. 
d. Lessening of Utility or Performance of 
Product 
In preparing the NOPR, DOE 
considered whether the evaluated 
design options likely would lessen the 
utility or performance of the standby 
mode and off mode of microwave ovens. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV)) In the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined 
that none of the considered TSLs would 
reduce the utility or performance of 
microwave ovens; all consumer utility 
features that affect standby power, such 
as a clock display and a cooking sensor, 
would be retained. 73 FR 62034, 62047 
(Oct. 17, 2008). 
e. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 
EPCA directs DOE to consider any 
lessening of competition likely to result 
from standards. It directs the Attorney 
General of the United States (Attorney 
General) to determine the impact, if any, 
of any lessening of competition likely to 
result from a proposed standard and to 
transmit such determination to the 
Secretary within 60 days of the 
publication of a proposed rule, together 
with an analysis of the nature and 
extent of the impact. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and (B)(ii)). DOE 
received the Attorney General’s 
determination, dated December 16, 
2008, on standards proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR. The Attorney 
General’s determination for October 
2008 NOPR did not mention microwave 
oven standards. (DOJ, No. 53 at pp. 1–

15 The EIA approves the use of the name NEMS 
to describe only an AEO version of the model 
without any modification to code or data. Because 
the present analysis entails some minor code 
modifications and runs the model under various 
policy scenarios that deviate from AEO 
assumptions, the model used here has been named 
NEMS–BT. (‘‘BT’’ stands for DOE’s Building 
Technologies Program.) For more information on 
NEMS, refer to The National Energy Modeling 
System: An Overview, DOE/EIA–0581 (98) (Feb. 
1998) (available at: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ 
FTPROOT/forecasting/058198.pdf). (Last accessed 
March 18, 2011.) 
2). DOE has transmitted a copy of 
today’s proposed rule to the Attorney 
General and has requested that the 
Department of Justice provide its 
determination on this issue. 
f. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 
The non-monetary benefits of 
proposed standards are likely to be 
reflected in improvements to the 
reliability of the Nation’s energy 
system—namely, reductions in the 
demand for energy will result in 
reduced costs for maintaining reliability 
of the Nation’s electricity system. DOE 
conducts a utility impact analysis to 
estimate how standards may impact the 
Nation’s needed power generation 
capacity. This analysis captures the 
effects of efficiency improvements on 
electricity consumption by the product 
that is the subject of this rulemaking. 
Proposed standards also likely result 
in improvements to the environment. In 
quantifying those improvements, DOE 
has calculated emission reductions 
based on the estimated level of power 
generation displaced by each TSL for 
microwave oven standby power. DOE 
reports the environmental effects from 
the proposed standards in an 
environmental assessment in chapter 15 
of the SNOPR TSD. (42. U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 6316(a)) See 
section IV.J for more details on this 
analysis. 
g. Other Factors 
The Secretary, in determining 
whether a standard is economically 
justified, may consider other factors that 
the Secretary deems to be relevant. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII)) In 
considering amended standards for 
today’s supplemental notice of proposed 
rulemaking, the Secretary found no 
relevant factors other than those 
identified elsewhere in today’s SNOPR. 
2. Rebuttable Presumption 
As set forth under 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), there is a rebuttable 
presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the increased installed cost 
for a product that meets the standard is 
less than three times the value of the 
first-year energy savings resulting from 
the standard. DOE’s LCC and PBP 
analyses generate values that calculate 
the payback period for consumers of 
products that meet potential energy 
conservation standards. Included is the 
3-year payback period contemplated 
under the rebuttable presumption test. 
DOE routinely conducts a full economic 
analysis that considers the full range of 
impacts, however, including those to 
the consumer, manufacturer, Nation, 
and environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). The results of 
this analysis serve as the basis for DOE 
to definitively evaluate the economic 
justification for a potential standard 
level (thereby supporting or rebutting 
the results of any preliminary 
determination of economic 
justification). Section V.B.1.c of today’s 
supplemental notice and chapter 8 of 
the SNOPR TSD address the calculation 
of rebuttable-presumption payback. 
IV. Methodology and Revisions to the 
Analyses Employed in the October 2008 
Proposed Rule 
In weighing the benefits and burdens 
of amended standards for microwave 
oven standby mode and off mode energy 
use, DOE used economic models to 
estimate the impacts of each TSL. The 
life-cycle cost (LCC) spreadsheet 
calculates the LCC impacts and payback 
periods for potential amended energy 
conservation standards. DOE used the 
engineering spreadsheet to develop the 
relationship between cost and efficiency 
and to calculate the simple payback 
period for purposes of addressing the 
rebuttable presumption that a standard 
with a payback period of less than 3 
years is economically justified. The NIA 
spreadsheet provides shipments 
forecasts and then calculates NES and 
NPV impacts of potential amended 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
also assessed manufacturer impacts, 
largely through use of the Government 
Regulatory Impact Model (GRIM). 
Additionally, DOE estimated the 
impacts of potential amended energy 
conservation standards on utilities and 
the environment. DOE used a version of 
the EIA’s National Energy Modeling 
System (NEMS) for the utility and 
environmental analyses. The EIA has 
developed the NEMS model, which 
simulates the energy economy of the 
United States, over several years 
primarily for the purpose of preparing 
the AEO. The NEMS produces forecasts 
for the United States energy situation 
that are available in the public domain. 
The version of NEMS used for appliance 
standards analysis is called NEMS– 
BT.15 The NEMS–BT offers a 
sophisticated picture of the effect of 
standards, because it accounts for the 
interactions among the various energy 
supply and demand sectors and the 
economy as a whole. 
A. Product Classes 
In general, when evaluating and 
establishing energy conservation 
standards, DOE divides covered 
products into classes by the type of 
energy used, capacity, or other 
performance-related features that affect 
consumer utility and efficiency. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(q); 6316(a)) Different energy 
conservation standards may apply to 
different product classes. Id. 
At the time of the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE’s regulations codified at 10 
CFR 430.2 defined a microwave oven as 
a class of kitchen ranges and ovens 
which is a household cooking appliance 
consisting of a compartment designed to 
cook or heat food by means of 
microwave energy. In the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE proposed a single product 
class for microwave ovens that would 
encompass microwave ovens with and 
without browning (thermal) elements, 
but would not include microwave ovens 
that incorporate convection systems. 73 
FR 62034, 62048 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
Whirlpool commented that DOE’s 
proposed definition of covered products 
creates a new product definition 
without proper engagement of interested 
parties by covering microwave ovens 
with or without thermal elements 
designed for surface browning of food. 
Whirlpool also commented that DOE 
stated combination microwave ovens, 
which were previously undefined, are 
not products covered by the microwave 
oven test procedure or standard. 
Whirlpool stated that DOE’s proposed 
definition of covered products is 
inconsistent with the regulatory 
definition of a microwave oven 
provided in 10 CFR part 430 because 
there is no mention of thermal elements 
designed for browning food, and 
furthermore is not clear and should be 
clarified. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at pp. 1–2; 
Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 29) GE also commented 
that DOE should clarify what products 
are considered covered products. GE 
stated that DOE should review data for 
different product types, and exclude 
those for which there is insufficient data 
to support DOE’s analysis. (GE, No. 48 
at pp. 2–3) 
As part of its microwave oven test 
procedure rulemaking, DOE reassessed 
what products would be considered 
microwave ovens under the regulatory 
definition, and whether multiple 
product classes would be appropriate.

8536 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
Interim Final Rule, DOE amended the 
definition of microwave oven in 10 CFR 
430.2 to clarify that it includes 
microwave ovens with or without 
thermal elements designed for surface 
browning of food and combination 
ovens. DOE also discussed its 
determination that all ovens equipped 
with microwave capability would be 
considered a covered product, 
regardless of which cooking mode (i.e., 
radiant heating or microwave energy) is 
primary. Based on its preliminary 
analysis, DOE concluded that the 
general standby mode and off mode 
operation for microwave ovens that 
incorporate other means of cooking food 
does not differ from that of microwave- 
only units. As a result, DOE amended 
the microwave oven test procedure to 
require that the same standby mode and 
off mode testing methods be used for all 
microwave ovens. 76 FR 12825, 12828– 
30 (Mar. 9, 2011). 
In order to determine whether specific 
types of microwave ovens should be 
separated into different product classes, 
DOE investigated whether there are any 
performance related features that would 
justify the establishment of a separate 
energy conservation standard. As 
discussed in the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE tested a sample of 32 countertop 
microwave-only units and measured 
standby mode power ranging from 1.2 
W to 5.8 W. 73 FR 62034, 62042 (Oct. 
17, 2008). None of these units was 
capable of operation in off mode, nor, as 
noted previously, is DOE aware of any 
other current microwave ovens capable 
of such operation. As discussed below 
in section IV.B, DOE noted that standby 
power consumption for microwave-only 
units largely depended on the presence 
of a cooking sensor, the display 
technology, the power supply and 
control board, and implementation of a 
power-down feature. With regards to 
display technologies, DOE noted that 
microwave-only units incorporated 
Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays, 
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), and 
Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFDs). 
Based on comments received in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR 
(Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers (AHAM), No. 47 at p. 6; 
Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 1), DOE 
conducted a survey of over-the-range 
microwave-only units available on the 
U.S. market. DOE determined that the 
display technologies used are similar to 
those used in countertop microwave- 
only units (i.e., LED displays, LCDs, and 
VFDs). DOE also conducted in-store 
standby mode testing on a limited 
sample of over-the-range microwave- 
only units which showed similar 
standby power consumption as 
countertop microwave-only units. For 
these reasons, DOE tentatively 
concludes that over-the-range 
microwave-only units would not 
warrant a separate product class. DOE 
understands that over-the-range 
microwave-only units may have 
additional components that are 
energized during active mode operation 
(i.e., exhaust fan motors). However, 
DOE’s testing showed that the presence 
of such features did not increase the 
standby power consumption to warrant 
establishing a separate product class. 
DOE also conducted standby power 
testing on a sample of 13 representative 
combination microwave ovens, 
including 5 countertop combination 
microwave ovens, 6 over-the-range 
combination microwave ovens, and 2 
built-in combination microwave ovens. 
DOE’s testing showed that the 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens use similar display technologies 
as countertop microwave-only units 
(i.e., LED displays, LCDs, and VFDs), 
and had standby power consumption 
ranging from 1.2 W to 4.7 W, which is 
similar to the standby power 
consumption for countertop microwave- 
only units. As a result, DOE tentatively 
concludes that countertop combination 
microwave ovens would not warrant a 
product class separate from microwave- 
only ovens. 
DOE’s testing of built-in and over-the- 
range combination microwave ovens 
showed that the standby power 
consumption for these products ranged 
from 4.1 W to 8.8 W, which is higher 
than the standby power consumption 
for other microwave oven product types 
(i.e., countertop microwave-only, over- 
the-range microwave-only, and 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens). DOE’s reverse-engineering 
analysis suggests that the additional 
features in built-in and over-the-range 
combination microwave ovens required 
to handle the thermal loads associated 
with their installation and to provide 
consumer utility, such as additional 
exhaust fan motors, convection fan 
motors and heaters, and additional 
lights, require a significant number of 
additional relays on the control board, 
and thus require a larger power supply 
for the control of such relays. While the 
relays themselves do not consume 
power in standby mode, they increase 
the total power supply requirements of 
the control board and thus increase the 
standby losses of the power supply. As 
a result, DOE believes that a separate 
product class should be established for 
built-in and over-the-range combination 
microwave ovens. DOE recognizes that 
built-in and over-the-range microwave- 
only units may similarly require some 
additional relays for exhaust fans and 
lights, and that countertop combination 
microwave ovens would require some 
additional relays for convection fans 
and heaters. However, DOE’s product 
testing and reverse-engineering analyses 
indicated that these product types use 
similar-sized power supplies as those 
found in countertop microwave-only 
units, and as a result would not warrant 
a separate product class from countertop 
microwave-only units. Details of 
standby power testing for the 
determination of product classes is 
presented in chapter 5 of the SNOPR 
TSD. 
In summary, DOE proposes to 
establish the following two product 
classes for microwave ovens: 
TABLE IV.1—MICROWAVE OVEN 
PRODUCT CLASSES 
Product class 
1. Microwave-Only Ovens and Countertop 
Combination Microwave Ovens. 
2. Built-in and Over-the-Range Combination 
Microwave Ovens. 
DOE determined that separate product 
classes for the purposes of setting 
energy conservation standards 
addressing standby mode and off mode 
energy use are warranted on the basis of 
different standby power performance. 
DOE did not evaluate whether the same 
product class distinction would also be 
appropriate for any active mode energy 
use standards because DOE eliminated 
the regulatory provisions establishing 
the cooking efficiency test procedure for 
microwave ovens in the July 2010 TP 
Final Rule. 75 FR 42579 (July 22, 2010). 
If DOE adopts amendments to the 
microwave oven test procedure to 
include provisions for measuring active 
mode cooking efficiency, DOE may 
reevaluate these product classes as part 
of a future microwave oven energy 
conservation standards rulemaking. At 
that time, DOE may consider dividing 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens and over-the-range/built-in 
microwave-only units into separate 
product classes to account for the 
energy performance of heating 
components other than the microwave 
portion. 
B. Technology Assessment 
Product teardowns performed by DOE 
for this and past rulemakings gave DOE 
an insight into the strategies a 
manufacturer could adopt to achieve 
higher energy conservation standards. In 
the October 2008 NOPR, DOE asked 
stakeholders to provide data and 
information that would help DOE

evaluate the utility provided by specific 
features that contribute to microwave 
oven standby power. In addition, DOE 
conducted additional research on 
several microwave oven technologies 
that significantly affect standby power, 
including cooking sensors, display 
technologies, and control strategies and 
associated control boards. In the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined 
that control strategies are available that 
enable manufacturers to make design 
tradeoffs between incorporating features 
that consumer standby power (such as 
displays or cooking sensors) and 
including a function to turn power off 
to those components during standby 
mode. 73 FR 62034, 62052 (Oct. 17, 
2008). 
As discussed above, DOE believes that 
the standby power characteristics for 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens and over-the-range microwave- 
only units are similar to that of counter- 
top microwave-only units, and 
therefore, the same technology options 
would apply to these products. 
Additional testing on over-the range 
combination microwave ovens 
conducted by DOE also showed that 
standby power in these products 
depends largely on the same factors. 
The following sections discuss each of 
these technology options. 
1. Cooking Sensors 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
reported that its teardown analysis had 
revealed one cooking sensor technology 
with no standby power consumption 
used in microwave ovens on the U.S. 
market: A piezoelectric steam sensor. 
DOE also found that infrared and weight 
sensors, which require little to no warm- 
up time or standby power, had been 
applied successfully in Japanese-market 
microwave ovens. Furthermore, DOE 
identified relative humidity sensors 
with no standby power consumption as 
a feasible microwave oven cooking 
sensor technology, but found no 
microwave ovens using these sensors at 
the time. Finally, DOE learned that a 
major microwave oven supplier to the 
U.S. market was preparing to introduce 
microwave ovens using a new type of 
absolute humidity sensor with no 
standby power requirement and no cost 
premium over that of a conventional 
absolute humidity sensor. 73 FR 62034, 
62051 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE requested 
input and data on the utility provided 
by specific microwave oven features, 
including in relevant part cooking 
sensors that do not require standby 
power. Id. at 62133. 
AHAM agreed with DOE that some 
manufacturers in certain areas of the 
world have already started to 
incorporate some of the cooking sensor 
design options into microwave ovens. 
(AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at pp. 78–79) AHAM expressed two 
concerns about these sensors: That 
reliability and accuracy of the sensors 
have not been fully proved through 
testing, and that there is limited 
availability of those sensors to 
microwave oven manufacturers due to 
intellectual property protections. 
(AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at pp. 69–70) AHAM further 
requested that DOE provide data on the 
availability, reliability, and 
functionality of the cooking sensors that 
consume no standby power. AHAM 
stated that data collection for such 
sensors provides an additional rationale 
for postponing the rulemaking or not 
adopting a standby power standard for 
microwave ovens. (AHAM, No. 47 at p. 
5) 
Whirlpool agreed with DOE that 
cooking sensors with no standby power 
consumption are becoming available, 
though experience with them is limited. 
According to Whirlpool, there is a lack 
of necessary data regarding reliability, 
accuracy and intellectual property 
status. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 7) 
GE similarly commented that cooking 
sensors with no standby power 
consumption, while in limited use at 
that time, had not been fully tested and 
evaluated as appropriate alternatives. 
GE also requested that DOE provide data 
on the availability, reliability, and 
functionality of the sensors discussed in 
the October 2008 NOPR, relative to 
sensors currently in use. (GE, No. 48 at 
p. 3) GE also commented that absolute 
humidity sensors with standby power 
consumption offer greater resolution 
than relative humidity sensors with no 
standby power consumption and 
therefore offer consumer utility. (GE, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 74–75) Furthermore, GE suggested 
that some of the sensor technologies 
described in the October 2008 NOPR, 
such as infrared and weight sensors, are 
not feasible alternatives to the absolute 
humidity sensors used today. For 
instance, infrared sensors are easily 
fouled by contaminants and 
condensation. GE commented that DOE 
should provide further information 
about absolute humidity sensors with 
no standby power consumption and no 
cost premium over that of a 
conventional absolute humidity sensor. 
GE stated that it needed to review 
performance parameters and any 
associated intellectual property issues 
associated with these sensors. (GE, No. 
48, pp. 3–4) 
DOE requested comment on whether 
any intellectual property or patent 
infringement issues are associated with 
the cooking sensor technologies 
discussed above; however, DOE did not 
receive any such data. In addition, DOE 
is not currently aware of any intellectual 
property or patent infringement issues 
for infrared sensors, weight sensors, 
piezoelectric sensors, or relative 
humidity sensors. With respect to the 
accuracy and reliability of low- and 
zero-standby power cooking sensors, 
DOE notes that a significant number of 
microwave oven models using the 
alternate cooking sensor technologies 
discussed above are available on the 
international market, and have been 
available for a number of years. As 
discussed above, DOE is also aware of 
one zero-standby power cooking sensor 
technology used in microwave ovens on 
the U.S. market. DOE is not aware of 
any data indicating that the reliability 
and accuracy associated with these low- 
and zero-standby power cooking sensors 
significantly differs from that of the 
absolute humidity sensors currently 
employed in microwave ovens on the 
U.S. market. DOE is also unaware of 
data showing that fouling of infrared 
cooking sensors, as commented by GE, 
would significantly differ from that of 
absolute humidity sensors, or data on 
the decreased accuracy due to fouling as 
compared to the fouling of absolute 
humidity sensors. DOE recognizes GE’s 
concern regarding the use of relative 
humidity sensors in microwave ovens. 
Because DOE is not aware of any 
relative humidity cooking sensors used 
in microwave ovens currently on the 
market, DOE is not aware of any data 
regarding the accuracy of these sensors 
for detecting the state of the cooking 
load to adjust the cooking time. 
However, DOE notes that multiple other 
cooking sensor technology options exist 
that have been employed in microwave 
ovens in place of an absolute humidity 
cooking sensor. For these reasons, DOE 
tentatively concludes that the low- and 
zero-standby-power cooking sensor 
technologies discussed above are viable 
design options, and has analyzed them 
for this SNOPR. DOE requests data and 
information on the accuracy and 
reliability of low- and zero-standby 
power cooking sensors as compared to 
absolute humidity cooking sensors 
currently used in microwave ovens on 
the U.S. market, and whether these 
technologies would affect how 
consumers use their microwave ovens 
or their satisfaction in using them due 
to any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of microwaves imposed by 
the standard. DOE also seeks 
information on the current commercial 
availability of this technology, the

likelihood of future adoption, and the 
potential impact on the lessening of 
competition amongst manufacturers. 
DOE also continues to request comment 
on whether any intellectual property or 
patent infringement issues are 
associated with the cooking sensor 
technologies discussed above. 
With respect to GE’s comment that 
DOE should provide further information 
on absolute humidity sensors with no 
standby power consumption and no cost 
premium over that of a conventional 
absolute humidity sensor, because DOE 
was made aware of this information 
during interviews with microwave oven 
manufacturers, DOE is unable to 
provide further information regarding 
this absolute humidity cooking sensor. 
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) stated 
that due to the reduction in cooking 
time and thus energy consumption 
made possible by use of a cooking 
sensor, it is important to retain this 
feature in microwave ovens. (EEI, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No 40.5 at pp. 71– 
72) Also, EEI expressed concern about 
the recovery time of a cooking sensor 
after a full microwave oven power-down 
and the impacts on consumer utility of 
a slow recovery time. (EEI, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 77– 
78) As discussed in the October 2008 
NOPR, low- and zero-standby-power 
cooking sensor technologies require 
little to no warm-up time. 73 FR 62034, 
62050–51 (Oct. 17, 2008). As a result, 
DOE believes that low- and zero- 
standby-power cooking sensor 
technologies can be used in microwave 
ovens without impacting consumer 
utility. 
2. Display Technologies 
DOE stated in the October 2008 NOPR 
that it would consider three display 
technologies for reducing microwave 
oven standby power consumption: LED 
displays, LCDs with and without 
backlighting, and VFDs. DOE stated that 
LED displays and LCDs consume less 
power than VFDs. DOE also stated that 
each identified display technology 
provides acceptable consumer utility, 
including brightness, viewing angle, and 
ability to display complex characters. 73 
FR 62034, 62051 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE 
requested input and data on the utility 
provided by specific microwave oven 
features, including, in relevant part, 
display technologies. Id. at 62133. 
EEI commented that consumer utility 
is associated with an electronic display 
and timer rather than a mechanical 
timer. (EEI, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at pp. 63–64). As discussed in 
the October 2008 NOPR, DOE was not 
aware of any microwave ovens currently 
available on the U.S. market using 
electromechanical controls (73 FR 
62034, 62051 (Oct. 17, 2008)), and thus 
has considered only electronic controls 
(including displays) in determining 
standby power levels. In addition, DOE 
is not considering electromechanical 
controls as a design option to reduce 
standby power consumption. 
AHAM, GE, and Whirlpool suggested 
that not all microwave oven display 
technologies considered by DOE will 
maintain consumer utility in all 
applications. Whirlpool stated that 
limiting the information displayed and/ 
or reducing the size of the clock reduces 
standby power consumption at the 
expense of consumer utility. AHAM and 
Whirlpool expressed concerns about the 
reliability of LED displays, particularly 
in over-the-range microwave oven 
applications. According to AHAM, GE, 
and Whirlpool, for over-the-range 
microwave oven applications, VFDs are 
generally preferred over other display 
technologies such as backlit LCDs or 
LED displays, as VFDs: (1) Have greater 
reliability when exposed to the higher 
heat encountered above a cooking 
surface; (2) allow a wider viewing angle 
and have greater visibility; and (3) are 
available in more sizes and colors as 
demanded by the consumers of higher- 
end products, also allowing a 
manufacturer to provide a ‘‘family look’’ 
to product suites. (AHAM, No. 47 at p. 
5; AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at pp. 70–71; GE, No. 48 at p. 
3; GE, Public Meeting Transcript, No 
40.5, p. 75; Whirlpool, No. 50 at pp. 6– 
7). 
As discussed above, DOE’s research 
suggests that multiple over-the-range 
microwave ovens with low power 
displays, including the LED and LCD 
types, are currently available on the U.S. 
market. DOE has also found that 
manufacturer temperature ratings for the 
three types of displays are comparable. 
Furthermore, DOE has found that LED 
displays and LCDs in both countertop 
and over-the-range microwave ovens 
offer acceptable consumer utility 
features, including brightness, viewing 
angle, and ability to display complex 
characters. DOE found no microwave 
oven display technologies with 
intermittent backlighting or other 
features that impair consumer utility. As 
a result, DOE believes that LED displays 
and LCDs can be integrated into any 
countertop or over-the-range microwave 
oven, with proper heat shielding and 
without significant loss of consumer 
utility. 
3. Power Supply and Control Boards 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
found several technologies available to 
increase power supply and control 
board efficiency that would reduce 
microwave oven standby power 
consumption. DOE found some 
microwave ovens on the U.S. market 
using switching power supplies with up 
to 75-percent conversion efficiencies 
and 0.2 W or less no-load standby 
losses, though these models came with 
a higher cost, higher part count, and 
greater complexity. DOE stated that 
switching power supplies are as yet 
unproven in long-term microwave oven 
applications, and the greater complexity 
of these power supplies may also lower 
overall reliability. DOE was also aware 
of high efficiency power supply and 
control board components that could be 
used to reduce standby power 
consumption, but these were not found 
on commercially available microwave 
ovens at the time. 73 FR 62034, 62051 
(Oct. 17, 2008). DOE requested 
comments on the ability of switching or 
similar modern power supplies to 
operate successfully inside a microwave 
oven and on the impacts of the 
efficiency of such power supplies on 
microwave oven standby power. Id. at 
62133. 
AHAM commented that switching 
power supplies can operate successfully 
in microwave ovens, but that associated 
reliability is still relatively unknown. 
(AHAM, No. 47 at p. 6) Whirlpool cited 
limited data suggesting that the costs 
and potential reliability issues 
associated with switching power 
supplies do not support their economic 
viability. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 8) 
Nevertheless, Whirlpool stated that it 
sells products with switching power 
supplies outside of the U.S. (Whirlpool, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 81–82) DOE observes that switching 
power supplies are found in products 
such as computers, battery chargers, 
clothes washers, and clothes dryers, 
suggesting that the reliability and 
durability of switching power supplies 
has been proven in residential appliance 
applications. DOE notes that microwave 
ovens incorporating switching power 
supplies have been available for 
multiple years and are still used, as 
evidenced by such power supplies being 
observed in DOE’s most recent test 
sample of combination microwave 
ovens. DOE is also unaware of data 
indicating that the reliability of 
switching power supplies is 
significantly worse than conventional 
linear power supplies over the lifetime 
of the product. 
Whirlpool suggested that switching 
power supplies are modestly more 
efficient than conventional power 
supplies. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 8) 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) 
commented that switching power

switch mode power supplies can be found at

supplies can have efficiency exceeding 
90 percent and those in computers are 
routinely exceeding 95 percent. (PG&E, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 
81) DOE believes that the application of 
power supplies is very different for 
computers and microwave ovens, and 
DOE research indicates that switching 
power supplies for appliance 
applications in sizes similar to those 
utilized in microwave ovens achieve no 
greater than 75-percent efficiency.16 
Furthermore, DOE notes that the most 
efficient power supplies available for 
consumer computer use typically do not 
exceed 92-percent efficiency.17 
AHAM expressed concern that 
electromechanical controls may be 
necessary in order to meet standby 
power requirements. (AHAM, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 58) As 
discussed above, DOE is not aware of 
any microwave ovens currently on the 
market with electromechanical controls. 
As a result, DOE has considered only 
microwave ovens with electronic 
controls in determining standby power 
levels. DOE does not believe that 
electromechanical controls would be 
required to achieve any of the standby 
power levels presented in section IV.D. 
4. Power-Down Options 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
determined that control strategies are 
available that allowed microwave oven 
manufacturers to make design tradeoffs 
between incorporating power- 
consuming features such as displays or 
cooking sensors and including a 
function to cut power to those 
components during standby. DOE found 
that a large number of microwave ovens 
incorporating this automatic power- 
down feature were available in other 
markets such as Japan. 73 FR 62034, 
62051–52 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE 
requested input and data on these 
control strategies as well as comments 
on the viability and cost of microwave 
oven control board circuitry that could 
accommodate transistors to switch off 
cooking sensors and displays. Id. at 
62133. 
AHAM commented that the industry 
lacks data on control board circuitry to 
allow for a function to cut off power 
during standby mode. According to 
AHAM, such features must be reliable 
in high-temperature environments. 
AHAM noted that DOE has allowed no 
time for manufacturers to evaluate the 
viability or feasibility of the proposed 
technologies. (AHAM, No. 47 at pp. 3, 
6) DOE research has not identified any 
technical barrier that would prevent 
microwave oven manufacturers from 
successfully integrating such control 
board circuitry with proper heat 
shielding and other design elements. 
DOE is also aware of similar automatic 
power-down control technologies 
incorporated in products such as clothes 
washers and clothes dryers, which 
utilize an additional transformerless 
power supply to provide just enough 
power to maintain the microcontroller 
chip while the unit is powered down, 
resulting in very low standby power 
levels. Therefore, DOE continues to 
believe that an automatic power-down 
feature is technically feasible in 
microwave applications. 
AHAM commented that it is 
concerned with a reduction in consumer 
utility and how the consumer interfaces 
with the unit. AHAM added that 
evaluating the impacts on consumer 
utility will require substantial consumer 
research. (AHAM, No. 47 at p. 6) AHAM 
suggested that an indicator light may be 
desirable in a microwave oven with the 
automatic power-down feature to 
communicate the product’s status to the 
user. (AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 59) Whirlpool 
stated that an automatic power-down 
feature in microwave ovens may cause 
consumer confusion and complaints 
and could require significant consumer 
education efforts. (Whirlpool, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 65– 
66) Whirlpool commented that control 
technologies are available to dim or turn 
off a display after a period of inactivity 
has elapsed but that Whirlpool does not 
currently incorporate such a technology 
into its products. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at 
p. 7) Whirlpool and ASAP both 
commented that there could be a variety 
of ways to implement a power-down 
feature, including consumer-activated or 
fuzzy logic-based power response. 
(ASAP, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 79; Whirlpool, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 80) DOE has 
considered consumer utility issues in 
the determination of the proposed 
standby mode and off mode energy 
conservation standards. (See section V.C 
of today’s supplemental notice and 
chapter 5 of the SNOPR TSD for 
additional discussion of this topic.) DOE 
welcomes further comments regarding 
consumer utility issues associated with 
each of the technology options, and in 
particular the low- and zero-standby 
power cooking sensors and display 
technologies, considered in this 
analysis. 
The comment filed jointly (hereafter, 
the Joint Comment) by ASAP, American 
Council for an Energy-Efficient 
Economy, American Rivers, Natural 
Resources Defense Council, Northeast 
Energy Efficiency Partnerships, 
Northwest Power and Conservation 
Council, Southern California Gas 
Company, San Diego Gas and Electric 
Company, Southern California Edison, 
and Earthjustice (EJ), stated that DOE 
should analyze user-activated controls 
to turn the display on and off, in 
addition to automatic power-down 
features. According to these 
commenters, a microwave oven 
equipped with such controls would 
meet the EPCA definition of operating 
in standby or off mode, and would give 
consumers the ability to reduce energy 
use below the proposed standby power 
standard level. The Joint Comment 
asserted that this type of switch is 
similar to power switches found on 
many computers, copiers, printers, 
televisions, and other products sold 
outside of the U.S. (Joint Comment, No. 
44 at p. 10) 
ASAP requested clarification whether 
an on/off switch, particularly a 
consumer-activated one, would be 
considered as a design option. (ASAP, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 66, 73–74) GE questioned whether a 
microwave oven would be in standby 
mode or off mode if the display is 
turned off. (GE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 73) 
Under the mode definitions adopted 
by the amended microwave oven test 
procedure (76 FR 12825, 12834–37 
(Mar. 9, 2011)), a product for which an 
on/off switch has turned off the display 
would be considered to be in off mode, 
unless other energy consuming features 
associated with standby mode remain 
energized (i.e., features to facilitate the 
activation of other modes by remote 
switch, internal sensor, or timer; or 
continuous functions, including other 
information or status displays or sensor- 
based features). In the latter case, the 
microwave oven would remain in 
standby mode even with the display 
turned off. 
DOE is not aware of any products 
incorporating a user-activated control to 
turn the display on or off. Further, DOE 
does not have information to evaluate 
how often consumers might make use of 
this feature. Therefore, at this time DOE 
is unable to analyze such a control as a 
design option. DOE agrees that such a 
feature, if provided, could result in 
decreased energy usage in standby mode 
or off mode, and remains open to 
consideration of such a design option in 
future rulemakings. DOE also notes that 
manufacturers would not be precluded

from incorporating such a feature in 
their products under the proposed 
standards. 
C. Engineering Analysis 
The purpose of the engineering 
analysis is to characterize the 
relationship between the energy use and 
the cost of standby mode features of 
microwave ovens. DOE used this 
standby power/cost relationship as 
input to the payback period, LCC, and 
NIA analyses. The engineering analysis 
provides data that can be used to 
establish the manufacturer selling price 
of more efficient products. Those data 
include manufacturing costs and 
manufacturer markups. 
DOE has identified three basic 
methods for generating manufacturing 
costs: (1) The design-option approach, 
which provides the incremental costs of 
adding to a baseline model design 
options that will improve its efficiency 
(i.e., lower its energy use in standby 
mode and off mode); (2) the efficiency- 
level approach, which provides the 
incremental costs of moving to higher 
energy efficiency levels (in this case, 
levels of reduced standby power), 
without regard to the particular design 
option(s) used to achieve such 
increases; and (3) the cost-assessment 
(or reverse engineering) approach, 
which provides ‘‘bottom-up’’ 
manufacturing cost assessments for 
achieving various levels of increased 
efficiency, based on detailed data on 
costs for parts and material, labor, 
shipping/packaging, and investment for 
models that operate at particular 
efficiency levels. DOE conducted the 
engineering analysis for this rulemaking 
using the efficiency-level approach. For 
this analysis, DOE relied on laboratory 
testing of representative microwave 
ovens. DOE supplemented the standby 
power data with data gained through 
reverse-engineering analysis and 
primary and secondary research, as 
appropriate. To identify microwave 
oven design options, DOE performed a 
reverse engineering analysis on a 
representative sample of microwave 
ovens. Details of the engineering 
analysis are in chapter 5 of the SNOPR 
TSD. 
1. Energy Use Metric 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
explored whether it would be 
technically feasible to combine the 
existing measure of energy efficiency 
during the cooking cycle per use with 
standby mode and off mode energy use 
over time to form a single metric, as 
required by EISA 2007. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(gg)(2)(A)) DOE tentatively 
concluded that, although it may be 
mathematically possible to combine 
energy consumption into a single metric 
encompassing active, standby, and off 
modes, it is not technically feasible to 
do so due to the high variability in the 
cooking efficiency measurement based 
on the microwave oven test procedure at 
that time and because of the significant 
contribution of standby power to overall 
microwave oven energy use. Therefore, 
DOE proposed a separate metric to 
measure standby power as provided by 
EISA 2007. 73 FR 62034, 62042–43 (Oct. 
17, 2008). 
ASAP, EEI, the Joint Comment, and 
Whirlpool agree with DOE’s 
determination that it is not technically 
feasible to integrate standby and off 
mode energy use into a single efficiency 
metric for microwave ovens. (ASAP, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 53; EEI, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 55; Joint Comment, No. 44 
at p. 10; Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 4; 
Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 29) AHAM stated that an 
integrated energy descriptor, while 
technically feasible, is not practical. 
(AHAM, No. 47 at p. 4; AHAM, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 27, 
54–55) ASAP questioned whether there 
was any legal prohibition on a 
prescriptive standard for microwave 
oven standby power, especially since 
DOE was at that time proposing a 
prescriptive standard for standing pilots 
in gas cooking products. (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 64– 
65) 
As noted previously, DOE eliminated 
the active mode cooking efficiency 
provisions in the July 2010 TP Final 
Rule after it determined that those 
provisions did not produce accurate and 
repeatable results. 75 FR 42579 (July 22, 
2010). Therefore, the absence of active 
mode provisions results in a de facto 
separate energy use descriptor for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use. 
2. Standby Power Levels 
DOE is considering standby mode and 
off mode standards based on a 
maximum average standby power, in W, 
for microwave ovens. For the reasons 
noted previously, the standards do not 
include off mode power. For the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE’s analysis 
estimated the incremental 
manufacturing cost for microwave ovens 
having standby power consumption less 
than the baseline level of 4 W. For the 
purposes of that analysis, a baseline 
microwave oven was considered to 
incorporate an absolute humidity 
cooking sensor. To analyze the cost- 
energy use relationship for microwave 
oven standby power, DOE defined 
standby power levels expressed as a 
maximum average standby power in W. 
To analyze the impacts of standards, 
DOE defined the following four standby 
power levels for analysis: (1) The 
Federal Energy Management Program 
(FEMP) procurement efficiency 
recommendation; (2) the International 
Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) 1-Watt Plan; (3) 
a standby power level as a gap-fill 
between the FEMP Procurement 
Efficiency Recommendation and IEA 1- 
Watt Plan; and (4) the current maximum 
microwave oven standby technology 
(max-tech; i.e., lowest standby power) 
that DOE believes is or could be 
commercially available when the energy 
conservation standards become 
effective, based on a review of 
microwave ovens currently on the 
market worldwide. Table IV.2 provides 
the microwave oven standby power 
levels and the reference source for each 
level that DOE analyzed for the October 
2008 NOPR. For more details on the 
determination of standby power levels, 
see chapter 5 of the SNOPR TSD.

8541 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
requested comments and views of 
interested parties concerning the 
selection of microwave oven standby 
power levels for the engineering 
analysis. 73 FR 62034, 62133 (Oct. 17, 
2008). As discussed in section V.A, due 
to the definition of only four standby 
power levels, a TSL was defined for 
each standby power level and thus 
standby power levels may also be 
referred to as TSLs. 
AHAM commented that the 
microwave oven standby power TSLs 
are appropriate. In particular, AHAM 
asserted that much of the worldwide 
industry is moving towards the IEA 1- 
Watt Program, which corresponds to 
one of the TSLs. However, AHAM stated 
that DOE’s engineering analysis based 
on these TSLs is incomplete and 
inaccurate. For example, none of the 32 
units tested by DOE were over-the-range 
units, whereas six of the 21 units in the 
AHAM sample were over-the-range 
units. According to AHAM, it is 
important to include over-the-range 
microwave ovens in the analysis 
because most of these units likely 
include a VFD, which is the most 
reliable display type in high 
temperature conditions. (AHAM, No. 47 
at p. 3; AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 83) 
As previously discussed, DOE 
research found that multiple over-the- 
range microwave ovens are currently 
available on the market that incorporate 
low-power display technologies, 
including LEDs and LCDs. DOE has also 
found that manufacturer temperature 
ratings for the three types of displays are 
comparable, and that LED displays and 
LCDs in both countertop and over-the- 
range microwave ovens offer acceptable 
consumer utility features, including 
brightness, viewing angle, and ability to 
display complex characters. Due to 
these findings, DOE believes that the 
TSLs and the associated analyses are 
still valid. 
Additionally, AHAM stated that each 
microwave oven standby power TSL 
should be set in a way that allows 
manufacturers a variety of pathways to 
reduce standby power consumption to 
that level. While some manufacturers 
are already starting to incorporate some 
of the standby power consumption- 
reducing design options identified by 
DOE, little or no data is available on 
some of the design trade-offs and 
reliability. (AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 78–79) DOE 
believes that multiple pathways exist, 
based on the selection of the (1) display 
technology, (2) power supply/control 
boards, (3) cooking sensors, and (4) the 
possible incorporation of algorithms to 
automatically reduce standby power 
after a period of inactivity, as stated in 
the October 2008 NOPR. 
Whirlpool commented that it is 
unaware of technologies that would 
allow microwave ovens equipped with 
VFDs to meet the 1-W standby power 
consumption limit of TSL 3 while 
keeping the display energized during 
standby mode. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 
7) GE stated that it has significant 
concerns about retaining all features 
associated with VFDs that impact 
consumer utility while reducing 
microwave oven standby power 
consumption to TSL 3. As a result, GE 
believes TSL 3 would reduce the utility 
or performance of microwave ovens. 
(GE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 
at p. 89) DOE has determined that 
microwave oven manufacturers can 
meet TSL 3 in microwave ovens with 
VFDs by incorporating an automatic 
power-down feature. In addition, DOE 
research suggests that LED displays and 
LCDs in both countertop and over-the- 
range microwave ovens offer acceptable 
consumer utility features, including 
brightness, viewing angle, and ability to 
display complex characters. Additional 
issues related to consumer utility are 
addressed in section V.C, which 
discusses the TSLs considered for 
proposed standby mode and off mode 
standards. 
AHAM requested additional 
information about the functionality 
associated with the microwave oven 
max-tech level, including response time 
from power-down. (AHAM, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 84) 
EEI also requested information about the 
max-tech level, such as whether it has 
as many display features and includes 
all the features of the baseline model. 
(EEI, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 84) 
As discussed in the October 2008 
NOPR, the max-tech microwave oven 
standby power level of 0.02 W 
corresponds to a unit equipped with a 
default automatic power-down function 
that shuts off certain power-consuming 
components after a specified period of 
user inactivity. The standby power at 
max-tech was obtained from a 
microwave oven currently on the market 
in Korea which incorporates such a 
feature. 73 FR 62034, 62045 (Oct. 17, 
2008). Although DOE does not have 
operational information on this specific 
model, DOE has analyzed the 
components necessary to achieve an 
automatic power-down function, and 
does not believe such a feature would 
limit the selection of display 
technologies or other features that 
provide consumer utility. DOE analysis 
suggests that response times for startup 
will be short enough (less than 1 
second) to be acceptable to consumers. 
For the reasons discussed above in 
section IV.A, DOE also analyzed a 
separate product class for over-the-range 
combination microwave ovens. DOE’s 
analysis estimates the incremental 
manufacturing cost for built-in and 
over-the-range combination microwave 
ovens having standby power 
consumption less than the baseline 
value of 4.5 W. To determine that 
baseline level, DOE measured the 
standby power consumption of a 
representative sample of built-in and 
over-the-range combination microwave 
ovens currently on the market. For the 
purpose of this standby power analysis, 
a baseline built-in/over-the-range 
combination microwave oven is 
considered to incorporate an absolute 
humidity cooking sensor. In order to 
analyze the cost-energy use relationship 
for this product class, DOE defined each 
standby power level as a maximum 
average standby power in watts. 
To determine the maximum average 
standby power at each level, DOE 
reverse-engineered a representative 
sample of built-in and over-the-range 
combination microwave ovens to 
analyze the various components that 
contribute to the standby power 
consumption of the unit. DOE also 
measured the standby power consumed 
by these components individually. In its 
analysis, DOE observed that the absolute 
humidity cooking sensor used in these 
combination microwave ovens on 
average consume 0.9 W of standby 
power. For Standby Power Level (SL) 1, 
DOE believes that standby power can be 
reduced by incorporating a zero-standby 
cooking sensor. For SL 2, DOE analyzed 
potential improvements to the power 
supply design. DOE noted that 
microwave ovens at the baseline 
standby energy use incorporate a linear 
power supply. DOE measured the 
standby power consumption of the 
power supply and found that the 
transformer used to step down the line 
input voltage contributes most 
significantly to the standby power 
consumption. DOE then performed a 
power budget analysis to determine the 
size of the transformer needed to 
operate a microwave at full load, and 
the results suggest that replacing the 
conventional linear power supply with 
a more efficient switch mode power 
supply will eliminate the need for a 
large transformer and effectively reduce 
the standby power associated with the 
power supply. DOE thus estimated the 
standby power for SL 2 based on the 
improvement associated with changing 
from a conventional linear power 
supply with an efficiency of 55 percent

appliances. 
to a switch mode power supply with an 
efficiency of 75 percent. DOE developed 
this estimate for the efficiency of a 
switch mode power supply based on 
research of such power supply designs 
for appliance applications.18 For SL 3, 
DOE analyzed the impact relays have in 
determining the size of a power supply. 
DOE compared the power budget of a 
control board with electromechanical 
relays to that with solid state relays, and 
observed that the power requirement of 
a control board, with similar input and 
load, is lower with solid state relays 
than with electromechanical relays. 
Therefore, DOE estimated the standby 
power at SL 3 based on design 
improvements associated with using 
more efficient components in a switch 
mode power supply that incorporates 
solid state relays. For SL 4, DOE 
analyzed an automatic function that 
turns off power to standby power 
consuming components after a certain 
period of inactivity and that uses a 
transformerless power supply to 
maintain the microcontroller chip while 
the microwave oven is not powered on. 
DOE estimated the standby power at SL 
4 based on the standby power 
requirements of the controller 
microcontroller chip. 
Table IV.3 provides the proposed 
standby power levels for the two 
product classes considered for today’s 
SNOPR. Details of the engineering 
analysis are in chapter 5 of the SNOPR 
TSD.

3. Manufacturing Costs 
In this rulemaking DOE estimates a 
manufacturing cost for microwave ovens 
at each standby power level. The 
manufacturing costs are the basis of 
inputs for other analyses, including the 
LCC, national impact, and GRIM 
analyses. 
For microwave oven standby mode 
and off mode energy use, DOE estimated 
a cost-energy use relationship (or 
‘‘curve’’) in the form of the incremental 
manufacturing costs associated with 
incremental reductions in baseline 
standby power. In the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE determined that microwave 
oven standby power depends on, among 
other factors, the display technology 
used, the associated power supplies and 
controllers, and the presence or lack of 
a cooking sensor. From testing and 
reverse engineering, DOE observed 
correlations between (1) specific 
components and technologies, or 
combinations thereof, and (2) measured 
standby power. DOE obtained 
preliminary incremental manufacturing 
costs associated with standby power 
levels by considering combinations of 
those components as well as other 
technology options identified to reduce 
standby power. In the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE presented manufacturing 
cost estimates based on quotes obtained 
from suppliers, interviews with 
manufacturers, interviews with subject 
matter experts, research and literature 
review, and numerical modeling. 73 FR 
62034, 62055 (Oct. 17, 2008). They are 
shown in Table IV.4.

3 ...................... 1 .0 1.47 
4 ...................... 0 .02 5.13 
Based on DOE’s research, interviews 
with subject matter experts, and 
discussions with manufacturers, DOE 
believes that all consumer utility 
(display, cooking sensor, etc.) could be 
maintained by standby power 
consumption down to SL 3 (1.0 W). At 
the max-tech level, DOE would expect 
implementation of an automatic power- 
down feature that would, among other 
things, shut off the display after a period 
of inactivity, potentially impacting 
consumer utility. 
DOE observed several different 
cooking sensor technologies. Follow-on 
testing after the December 2007 public 
meeting showed that some sensors are 
zero-standby (relative humidity) 
cooking sensors. During the MIA 
interview for the NOPR, one 
manufacturer indicated that its supplier 
of cooking sensors had developed zero- 
standby absolute humidity cooking 
sensors that would have the same 
manufacturing cost as the higher- 
standby power devices they would 
replace. Based on the number of 
available approaches to zero-standby 
cooking sensors from which 
manufacturers can choose, DOE believes 
that all manufacturers can and likely 
will implement zero-standby cooking 
sensors by the effective date of standby 
mode and off mode energy conservation 
standards, and maintain the consumer 
utility of a cooking sensor without 
affecting unit cost. DOE believes that a 
standard at standby power levels of 1 or 
2 W would not affect consumer utility, 
because all display types could continue 
to be used. At SL 3 for VFDs and SL 4 
for all display technologies, DOE 
analysis suggests the need for a separate 
controller (automatic power-down) that 
automatically turns off all other power- 
consuming components during standby 
mode. Such a feature would affect the 
consumer utility of having a clock 
display only if the consumer could not 
opt out of auto power-down. 
DOE requested input and data from 
interested parties on the estimated 
incremental manufacturing costs, as 
well as the assumed approaches, to 
achieve each microwave oven standby 
power level. DOE also requested 
comment on whether any intellectual 
property or patent infringement issues 
are associated with the design options

presented in the NOPR TSD to achieve 
each standby power level. 73 FR 62034, 
62133 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
AHAM questioned the source of the 
incremental cost data associated with 
each standby power level presented by 
DOE, since some microwave oven 
manufacturers cannot recall providing 
this information to DOE. AHAM 
commented on the need for incremental 
manufacturing costs to reflect both a 
one-time cost as well as the possibility 
of multiple paths to achieve each TSL. 
(AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 87) GE commented that the 
cost associated with upgrading power 
supplies to reach TSL 3 is a question. 
(GE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 
at pp. 75–76) 
As described in chapter 5 of the TSD 
published with the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE developed incremental cost 
estimates for each standby power level 
using the design-option approach. (One- 
time costs are evaluated as part of the 
MIA.) DOE estimated costs for each of 
the components and technologies based 
on quotes from component suppliers, 
interviews with manufacturers, 
interviews with subject matter experts, 
research and literature review, and 
numerical modeling. The incremental 
manufacturing costs for each standby 
power level were determined by 
considering different combinations of 
these components as well as other 
technology options identified to reduce 
standby power. 
DOE is aware that manufacturers may 
employ a number of strategies to 
achieve the different standby power 
levels. The estimated manufacturing 
costs for each standby power level 
represent the approach DOE believes 
manufacturers would most likely use to 
achieve the standby power at each level. 
For each level, DOE assumed 
manufacturers would implement design 
options with the lowest associated 
manufacturing cost. If DOE determined 
there were multiple paths with similar 
costs to reach a certain level, it assumed 
manufacturers would be equally likely 
to choose either strategy. 
Whirlpool commented that its market 
research suggests high costs associated 
with consumer education on proper 
operation of microwave ovens with 
automatic power-down features. 
Whirlpool clarified that the marketing 
costs it submitted for the ANOPR did 
not include these costs, estimated at $10 
million, including retailer training, 
point-of-purchase material, product 
tags, telephone support, and possibly 
more. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 7) AHAM 
also commented that DOE did not 
complete a rigorous analysis on 
manufacturing costs. According to 
AHAM, DOE obtained component costs, 
but did not account for the cost 
implications on appliance 
manufacturers. AHAM stated that this 
includes variables such as component 
reliability and/or utility, both of which 
will impact manufacturer cost. (AHAM, 
No. 47 at p. 6) 
DOE considered any conversion costs 
associated with changes to consumer 
utility and reliability in the 
manufacturer impact analysis, discussed 
in section IV.G. However, as previously 
discussed, DOE found no reliability or 
consumer utility concerns with 
switching from VFD to LCD or LED 
displays. Through discussions with 
manufacturers and OEMs, DOE believes 
that zero-standby cooking sensors could 
be implemented with no effect on 
consumer utility or reliability. DOE is 
aware that an automatic power-down 
feature required at SL 3 for VFDs and at 
SL 4 for all display types could affect 
consumer utility, and considered these 
impacts in the selection of the proposed 
standards. 
For the reasons described above, DOE 
believes the standby power levels and 
corresponding incremental 
manufacturing costs presented in the 
October 2008 NOPR remain 
fundamentally valid for the microwave- 
only and countertop combination 
microwave oven product class. DOE is 
unaware of any technologies that have 
become available since the publishing of 
the October 2008 NOPR that would alter 
the incremental cost for any standby 
power level. However, the costs 
presented in the October 2008 NOPR are 
in 2008 dollars. DOE scaled these costs 
to 2010 dollars using the producer price 
index (PPI) to reflect more current 
values.19 The relevant PPI for 
microwave ovens is a subset of the 
household cooking appliance 
manufacturing industry, specifically for 
electric (including microwave) 
household ranges, ovens, surface 
cooking units, and equipment. Table 
IV.5 shows the revised incremental 
costs for each standby power level for 
Product Class 1, scaled to 2010 dollars.

As discussed in section IV.A, for 
today’s SNOPR, DOE is proposing two 
product classes for microwave ovens. 
While the analysis presented in the 
October 2008 NOPR remains relevant 
for the microwave-only and countertop 
combination microwave oven product 
class, DOE conducted analyses on a test 
sample of 13 combination microwave 
ovens for this SNOPR to evaluate the 
built-in and over-the-range combination 
microwave oven product class. DOE 
again used the design-option approach 
to determine the incremental 
manufacturing costs of combination 
microwave ovens for each standby 
power level. 
DOE estimated the incremental cost 
associated with reductions in baseline 
standby power of built-in and over-the- 
range combination microwave ovens. 
DOE performed engineering teardowns 
and control board cost analyses to 
determine the cost of the baseline 
control board used in these units. DOE 
estimated the cost associated with each 
standby power level by using quotes 
from various component suppliers to 
determine the cost of the components 
used in each design option. 
For SL 1, DOE estimated that the 
manufacturing cost of a zero-standby 
cooking sensor would be the same as 
that of the cooking sensor with high 
standby power. To estimate the 
manufacturing cost for SL 2, DOE used 
reverse engineering to determine the 
cost of the components used in a design 
of a switch mode power supply capable 
of delivering the same output power as 
the baseline conventional linear power 
supply. In its analysis for the 
manufacturing cost of SL 3, DOE 
determined the cost of the components 
used to design a control board with a 
switch mode power supply and solid 
state relays capable of driving the same 
loads as the electromechanical relays. 
DOE estimated the manufacturing cost 
for SL 4 based on the cost of the 
components needed to design an 
automatic power-down function that 
uses a transformerless power supply. 
The results of these new analyses are 
summarized in Table IV.6. For the 
detailed cost-energy use analysis,

and design changes to meet standby

D. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
Analysis 
In response to the requirements of 
section 325(o)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, DOE 
conducted LCC and PBP analyses to 
evaluate the economic impacts of 
possible amended energy conservation 
standards for consumers of microwave 
ovens having standby mode and off 
mode features. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) DOE conducted the 
analyses using a spreadsheet model 
developed in Microsoft (MS) Excel for 
Windows 2007. (See chapter 8 of the 
SNOPR TSD.) 
The LCC represents the total 
consumer expense over the life of a 
product, including purchase and 
installation expense and operating costs 
(energy expenditures, repair costs, and 
maintenance costs). The PBP is the 
number of years it would take for the 
consumer to recover the increased costs 
of a higher-efficiency product through 
energy savings. To calculate the LCC, 
DOE discounts future operating costs to 
the time of purchase and sums them 
over the lifetime of the product. DOE 
forecasts the change in LCC and the 
change in PBP associated with a given 
efficiency level relative to the base-case 
product efficiency. The base-case 
forecast reflects the market in the 
absence of amended mandatory energy 
conservation standards. As part of the 
LCC and PBP analyses, DOE develops 
data that it uses to establish product 
prices, annual energy consumption, 
energy prices, maintenance and repair 
costs, product lifetime, and discount 
rates. 
DOE developed a consumer sample 
for microwave ovens having standby 
mode and off mode features from EIA’s 
2005 Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey (RECS). It used this sample to 
establish the variability and uncertainty 
in microwave oven electricity use. The 
variability in electricity pricing was 
characterized by incorporating regional 
energy prices. DOE calculated the LCC 
associated with a baseline microwave 
oven having standby mode and off mode 
features. To calculate the LCC savings 
and PBP associated with products that 
could meet potential amended energy 
conservation standards, DOE substituted 
the baseline unit with more efficient 
designs. 
Table IV.7 summarizes the 
approaches and data DOE used to derive 
the inputs to the LCC and PBP 
calculations for the October 2008 NOPR, 
and the changes it made for today’s 
SNOPR. DOE did not introduce changes 
to the LCC and PBP analysis 
methodology described in the October 
2008 NOPR. As the following sections 
discuss in more detail, however, DOE 
revised some of the inputs to the 
analysis. Chapter 8 of the SNOPR TSD 
contains a detailed discussion of the 
methodology utilized for the LCC and 
PBP analysis as well as the inputs 
developed for the analysis.

1. Product Costs 
To calculate the product costs paid by 
microwave oven purchasers, DOE 
multiplied the manufacturing selling 
prices developed from the engineering 
analysis by the supply chain markups it 
developed (along with sales taxes). DOE 
used the same supply chain markups for 
today’s SNOPR that were developed for 
the October 2008 NOPR. See chapter 6 
of the SNOPR TSD for additional 
information. For the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE analyzed only countertop 
models of microwave ovens and 
considered installation costs to be zero. 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE analyzed both 
countertop and over-the-range 
microwave ovens and considered 
installation costs to be zero. 
On February 22, 2011, DOE published 
a Notice of Data Availability (NODA, 76 
FR 9696) stating that DOE may consider 
improving regulatory analysis by 
addressing equipment price trends. 
Consistent with the NODA, DOE 
examined historical producer price 
indices (PPI) for electric cooking 
equipment generally and microwave 
ovens specifically and found a 
consistent, long-term declining real 
price trend. Consistent with the method 
proposed in the NODA, DOE used 
experience curve fits to develop a price 
scaling index to forecast product costs 
for this rulemaking. 
DOE also considered the public 
comments that were received in 
response to the NODA and refined its 
experience curve trend forecasting 
estimates. Many commenters were 
supportive of DOE moving from an 
assumption-based equipment price 
trend forecasting method to a data- 
driven methodology for forecasting 
price trends. Other commenters were 
skeptical that DOE could accurately 
forecast price trends given the many 
variables and factors that can 
complicate both the estimation and the 
interpretation of the numerical price 
trend results and the relationship 
between price and cost. DOE evaluated 
these concerns and determined that 
retaining the assumption-based 
approach of a constant real price trend 
was not consistent with the historical 
data for the products covered in this 
rule (though this scenario does 
represent a reasonable upper bound on 
the future equipment price trend). DOE 
also performed an initial evaluation of 
the possibility of other factors 
complicating the estimation of the long- 
term price trend, and developed a range 
of potential price trend values that was 
consistent with the available data and 
justified by the amount of data that was 
available to DOE at this time. DOE 
recognizes that its price trend 
forecasting methods are likely to be 
modified as more data and information 
becomes available to enhance the 
statistical certainty of the trend estimate 
and the completeness of the model. 
Additional data should enable an 
improved evaluation of the potential 
impacts of more of the factors that can 
influence equipment price trends over 
time. 
To evaluate the impact of the 
uncertainty of the price trend estimates, 
DOE performed price trend sensitivity 
calculations in the national impact 
analysis to examine the dependence of 
the analysis results on different 
analytical assumptions. DOE also 
included a constant real price trend 
assumption as a sensitivity scenario 
representing an upper bound on the 
forecast price trend. 
A more detailed discussion of DOE’s 
price trend modeling and calculations is 
provided in appendix 8–E of the SNOPR 
TSD. 
2. Annual Energy Consumption 
DOE determined the annual energy 
consumption of the standby mode and 
off mode of microwave ovens by 
estimating the number of hours of 
operation throughout the year and 
assuming that the unit would be in 
standby mode or off mode the rest of the 
time. DOE estimated the number of 
operating hours relative to the baseline 
of 71 hours calculated in the NOPR. 
DOE subtracted the number of 
calculated operating hours from the 
total number of hours in a year and 
multiplied by the standby mode and off 
mode power usage to determine yearly 
standby mode and off mode energy 
consumption. 
3. Energy Prices 
DOE derived average electricity prices 
for 13 geographic areas consisting of the 
nine U.S. Census divisions, with four 
large States (New York, Florida, Texas, 
and California) treated separately. DOE 
estimated residential electricity prices 
for each of the 13 geographic areas 
based on data from EIA Form 861, 
‘‘Annual Electric Power Industry 
Report.’’ DOE calculated an average 
residential electricity price by first 
estimating an average residential price 
for each utility, and then calculating a 
regional average price by weighting each 
utility having customers in a region by 
the number of residential customers 
served in that region. The calculations 
for today’s SNOPR used the most recent 
available data (2009). 
To estimate trends in electricity prices 
for the October 2008 NOPR, DOE used 
the price forecasts in EIA’s AEO 2008. 
To arrive at prices in future years, DOE 
multiplied the average prices described 
above by the forecast of annual average 
price changes in AEO 2008. For today’s 
supplemental notice, DOE updated its 
energy price forecasts using those in the 
AEO 2010 May Release. Because the 
AEO forecasts prices only to 2035, DOE 
followed past guidelines that EIA 
provided to the Federal Energy 
Management Program and used the 
average rate of change during 2020– 
2035 to estimate price trends beyond 
2035. 
The spreadsheet tools used to conduct 
the LCC and PBP analysis allow users to 
select energy price forecasts for either 
the AEO’s High economic growth case 
or Low economic growth case to 
estimate the sensitivity of the LCC and 
PBP to different energy price forecasts. 
DOE received comment regarding the 
inputs to the energy price forecasts. The 
Joint Comment recommended that DOE 
conduct a sensitivity analysis using a 
basket of other forecasts besides the 
AEO. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 11) 
As mentioned above, DOE considered 
price forecasts from the AEO’s High and 
Low economic growth cases to estimate 
the sensitivity of the LCC and PBP 
results to different energy price 
forecasts. The alternative forecasts from 
the AEO provide a suitable range to 
examine the sensitivity of LCC and PBP 
results to different energy price 
forecasts. 
The Joint Comment also stated that to 
realistically depict energy prices in the 
future, DOE must consider the impact of 
carbon control legislation, because such 
legislation is likely. It also noted that 
there are regional cap-and-trade 
programs in effect in the Northeast 
(Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
[RGGI]) and the West (Western Climate 
Initiative [WCI]) that will affect the 
price of electricity, which was not yet 
reflected in the AEO energy price 
forecasts. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 
12) EJ stated that caps likely will be in 
place by the time new standards become 
effective, so DOE should increase its 
electricity prices to reflect the cost of 
complying with emission caps. (EJ, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 105–106) 
In response, DOE believes that the 
shape of Federal carbon control 
legislation, and the ensuing cost to 
electricity generators of carbon 
mitigation, is too uncertain to 
incorporate into the energy price 
forecasts that DOE uses. The costs to 
electricity generators of carbon 
mitigation resulting from the regional 
programs are also uncertain over the 
forecast period for this rulemaking. That 
being said, EIA included the effect of

the RGGI in its energy price forecasts for 
the AEO 2010 May Release. (WCI did 
not provide sufficient detail to EIA in 
order for them to model WCI’s impact 
on energy price forecasts.) Therefore, 
the energy price forecasts used in 
today’s supplemental notice include the 
impact of one of the two regional cap- 
and-trade programs in the United States. 
4. Repair and Maintenance Costs 
Repair costs are those associated with 
repairing or replacing components that 
have failed in an appliance; 
maintenance costs are associated with 
maintaining the operation of the 
product. For the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE did not include repair or 
maintenance costs in its analyses. DOE 
maintained the same approach for this 
SNOPR. 
5. Product Lifetime 
For the October 2008 NOPR and 
today’s SNOPR, DOE used a variety of 
sources to establish low, average, and 
high estimates for product lifetime. The 
average microwave oven lifetime used 
was 9.3 years. DOE used a Weibull 
probability distribution to characterize 
microwave oven lifetime. 
6. Discount Rates 
In the calculation of LCC, DOE 
applies discount rates to estimate the 
present value of future operating costs. 
DOE estimated a distribution of 
residential discount rates for microwave 
ovens. See chapter 8 in the SNOPR TSD 
for further details on the development of 
consumer discount rates. 
To establish residential discount rates 
for the LCC analysis in the October 2008 
NOPR and today’s SNOPR, DOE 
identified all debt or asset classes that 
consumers might use to purchase 
household appliances, including 
household assets that might be affected 
indirectly. It estimated average 
percentage shares of the various debt or 
asset classes for the average U.S. 
household using data from the Federal 
Reserve Board’s ‘‘Survey of Consumer 
Finances’’ (SCF) for 1989, 1992, 1995, 
1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007. Using the 
SCF and other sources, DOE then 
developed a distribution of rates for 
each type of debt and asset to represent 
the rates that may apply in the year in 
which new standards would take effect. 
DOE assigned each sample household a 
specific discount rate drawn from one of 
the distributions. The average rate 
across all types of household debt and 
equity, weighted by the shares of each 
class, is 5.1 percent. DOE used the same 
approach for today’s supplemental 
notice. 
7. Effective Date of New Standards 
The effective date is the future date 
when parties subject to the requirements 
of a new energy conservation standard 
must begin compliance. For the NOPR, 
DOE assumed that any new standards 
adopted in this rulemaking would 
become effective in March 2012, 3 years 
after the month when it expected the 
final rule would be published in the 
Federal Register. For today’s SNOPR, 
DOE expects that the final rule will be 
published in 2011, with new standards 
requiring compliance three years later. 
Thus, DOE calculated the LCC for 
appliance consumers as if they would 
purchase new products in 2014. 
8. Product Energy Efficiency in the Base 
Case 
For the LCC and PBP analysis, DOE 
analyzes higher efficiency levels relative 
to a base case (i.e., the case without new 
energy conservation standards). 
However, some consumers may already 
purchase products having efficiencies 
greater than the baseline product levels. 
Thus, to accurately estimate the 
percentage of consumers that would be 
affected by a particular standard level, 
DOE estimates the distribution of 
product efficiencies that consumers are 
expected to purchase under the base 
case. DOE refers to this distribution of 
product energy efficiencies as a base- 
case efficiency distribution. For the 
October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, DOE used the current shares of 
available models at specific standby 
power levels to establish the base-case 
efficiency distributions. Table IV.8 
presents the market shares of the 
standby power levels in the base case 
for standby mode and off mode energy 
use of microwave ovens.

* TSL = Trial Standard Level. 
9. Inputs to Payback Period Analysis 
The PBP is the amount of time 
(expressed in years) it takes the 
consumer to recover the additional 
installed cost of a more efficient product 
through operating cost savings, 
compared to the baseline product. The 
simple payback period does not account 
for changes in operating expenses over 
time or the time value of money. The 
inputs to the PBP calculation are the 
total installed cost of the product to the 
consumer for each efficiency level and 
the annual (first-year) operating 
expenditures for each efficiency level. 
For the October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, the PBP calculation uses the 
same inputs as the LCC analysis, except 
that energy price trends and discount 
rates are not needed. 
10. Rebuttable-Presumption Payback 
Period 
As noted above, EPCA, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) establishes 
a rebuttable presumption that a standard 
is economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that ‘‘the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy savings 
during the first year that the consumer 
will receive as a result of the standard,’’ 
as calculated under the test procedure 
in place for that standard. For each TSL, 
DOE determined the value of the first 
year’s energy savings by calculating the 
quantity of those savings in accordance 
with DOE’s test procedure, and 
multiplying that amount by the average 
energy price forecast for the year in 
which a new standard first would be 
effective—in this case, 2014.

8547 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
DOE received comments addressing 
the topic of using a rebuttable- 
presumption payback period to 
establish the economic justification of 
an energy conservation standard. The 
Joint Comment and EJ stated that DOE’s 
view that it is necessary to consider a 
full range of impacts because the 
rebuttable presumption criterion is 
insufficient for determining economic 
justification does not reflect the extent 
to which the rebuttable-presumption 
analysis constrains DOE’s authority to 
reject standards based on economic 
impacts. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at 
appendix B, p. 1; EJ, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 130) The Joint 
Comment stated that in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), Congress erected a 
significant barrier to DOE’s rejection, on 
the basis of economic justifiability, of 
standard levels to which the rebuttable 
presumption applies. Further, EJ and 
the Joint Comment stated DOE’s 
preference to proceed under the seven- 
factor test contained in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) is not pertinent. The 
Joint Comment agreed with DOE that 
analysis under the seven-factor test is 
necessary and typically has supported 
standards having paybacks longer than 
3 years. However, the Joint Comment 
stated that DOE’s decision making must 
reflect the expressed intent of Congress 
that the highest standard level resulting 
in cost recovery within 3 years 
constitutes the presumptive lowest 
standard level that DOE must adopt. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at appendix B, 
pp. 1–2) 
In response, when examining 
potential standard levels DOE considers 
both the rebuttable-presumption 
payback criteria, as well as a full 
analysis that includes all seven relevant 
statutory criteria under 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i). DOE believes, however, 
that the commenters are misinterpreting 
the statutory provision in question. The 
Joint Comment and EJ state that DOE 
need not look beyond the results of the 
rebuttable-presumption analysis, but 
DOE believes that the statute contains 
no such restriction, and following this 
approach would potentially force the 
agency to ignore other relevant 
information that would bear on the 
selection of the most stringent standard 
level that meets all applicable statutory 
criteria. Similarly, DOE believes that the 
Joint Comment misreads the statute in 
calling for a level that meets the 
rebuttable-presumption test to serve as a 
minimum level when setting the final 
energy conservation standard. To do so 
would not only eliminate the 
‘‘rebuttable’’ aspect of the presumption 
but also would lock in place a level that 
may not be economically justified based 
on a full review of statutory criteria. 
EPCA already obligates DOE to select 
the most stringent standard level that 
meets the applicable statutory criteria. 
E. National Impact Analysis—National 
Energy Savings and Net Present Value 
Analysis 
1. General 
DOE’s NIA assesses the national 
energy savings, as well as the national 
NPV, of total consumer costs and 
savings expected to result from new or 
amended standards at specific efficiency 
levels. DOE applied the NIA 
spreadsheet to calculate energy savings 
and NPV, using the annual energy 
consumption and total installed cost 
data from the LCC analysis. DOE 
forecasted the energy savings, energy 
cost savings, product costs, and NPV for 
the two product classes from 2014 to 
2043. The forecasts provide annual and 
cumulative values for all four 
parameters. In addition, DOE 
incorporated into its NIA spreadsheet 
the capability to analyze sensitivity of 
the results to forecasted energy prices 
and product efficiency trends. Table 
IV.9 summarizes the approach and data 
DOE used to derive the inputs to the 
NES and NPV analyses for the October 
2008 NOPR and the changes made in 
the analyses for today’s SNOPR. A 
discussion of the 2008 inputs and the 
changes follows. (See chapter 10 of the 
SNOPR TSD for further details.)

2. Shipments 
The shipments portion of the NIA 
spreadsheet is a model that uses 
historical data as a basis for projecting 
future shipments of the products that 
are the subject of this rulemaking. In 
projecting microwave oven shipments, 
DOE accounted for two market 
segments: (1) New construction; and (2) 
replacement of failed products. Because 
shipments for new construction and 
replacements were not enough to 
account for all product shipments, DOE 
developed another market segment to 
calibrate its shipments model. In 
addition to normal replacements, DOE’s 
shipments model also assumed that a 
small fraction of the stock would be 
replaced early. It also considered retired 
units not replaced. DOE used the non- 
replacement market segment to calibrate 
the shipments model to historical 
shipments data. 
To estimate the impacts of 
prospective standards on product 
shipments (i.e., to forecast standards- 
case shipments), DOE considered the 
combined effects of changes in purchase 
price, annual operating cost, and 
household income on the magnitude of 
shipments. 
Table IV.10 summarizes the approach 
and data DOE used to derive the inputs 
to the shipments analysis for the 
October 2008 NOPR, and the changes it 
made for today’s SNOPR. The general 
approach for forecasting microwave 
shipments for today’s SNOPR remains 
unchanged from the NOPR.

a. New Construction Shipments 
To estimate shipments for new 
construction, DOE used forecasts of 
housing starts coupled with microwave 
oven saturation data. In other words, to 
forecast the shipments for new 
construction in any given year, DOE 
multiplied the housing forecast by the 
forecasted saturation of microwave 
ovens for new housing. 
New housing comprises single- and 
multi-family units (also referred to as 
‘‘new housing completions’’) and 
mobile home placements. DOE 
forecasted new housing based on EIA’s 
AEO 2010 for 2005–2035. AEO 2010 
provides three sets of forecasts: the 
Reference case, the High economic 
growth case, and the Low economic 
growth case. DOE used the forecasts 
from the Reference case for the NIA 
results reported in this notice. For the 
Reference case, the forecast shows a 
decline in housing completions from 2.2 
million in 2005 to 1.7 million by 2030. 
For 2035–2043, DOE froze completions 
at the level in 2035. 
b. Replacements and Non-Replacements 
To determine shipments for the 
replacement market, DOE used an 
accounting method that tracks the total 
stock of units by vintage. DOE estimated 
a stock of microwave ovens by vintage 
by integrating historical shipments 
starting from 1972. Over time, some 
units are retired and removed from the 
stock, triggering the shipment of a 
replacement unit. Depending on the 
vintage, a certain percentage of each 
type of unit will fail and need to be 
replaced. To determine when a 
microwave oven fails, DOE used data 
from RECS and AHS to estimate a 
product survival function. This function 
was modeled as a Weibull distribution. 
Based on this method, the average 
calculated microwave oven lifetime is 
9.3 years. For a more complete 
discussion of microwave lifetimes, refer 
to section 8.2.3 of chapter 8 of the 
SNOPR TSD. 
3. Purchase Price, Operating Cost, and 
Income Impacts 
To estimate the combined effects of 
increases in product purchase price and 
decreases in product operating costs on 
microwave oven shipments, for the 
October 2008 NOPR DOE used a

literature review and a statistical 
analysis on a limited set of appliance 
price, efficiency, and shipments data. 
DOE used purchase price and efficiency 
data specific to microwave ovens 
between 1980 and 2002 to conduct 
regression analyses. DOE’s analysis 
suggested that the relative short-run 
price elasticity of demand is ¥0.34. 
Because DOE’s forecast of shipments 
and national impacts attributable to 
standards spans more than 30 years, 
DOE also considered how the relative 
price elasticity is affected once a new 
standard takes effect. After the purchase 
price changes, price elasticity becomes 
more inelastic over the years until it 
reaches a terminal value. For the 
October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, DOE incorporated a relative 
price elasticity change that resulted in a 
terminal value of approximately one- 
third of the short-run elasticity. In other 
words, DOE determined that consumer 
purchase decisions, in time, become less 
sensitive to the initial change in the 
product’s relative price. 
4. Other Inputs 
a. Forecasted Efficiencies 
A key input to the calculations of NES 
and NPV are the energy efficiencies that 
DOE forecasts for the base case (without 
new standards). The forecasted 
efficiencies represent the annual 
shipment-weighted energy efficiency 
(SWEF) of the product under 
consideration during the forecast period 
(i.e., from the estimated effective date of 
a new standard to 30 years after that 
date). Because DOE had no data to 
reasonably estimate how microwave 
oven standby power levels might change 
during the next 30 years, it assumed that 
forecasted efficiencies will stay at the 
2014 standby power levels until the end 
of the forecast period. 
For its determination of the cases 
under alternative standard levels 
(‘‘standards cases’’), DOE used a ‘‘roll- 
up’’ scenario in the October 2008 NOPR 
to establish the SWEF for 2012. For 
today’s SNOPR, DOE established the 
SWEF for 2014 and assumed that 
product efficiencies in the base case that 
do not meet the standard level under 
consideration would roll-up to meet the 
new standard level. DOE assumed that 
all product efficiencies in the base case 
that were above the standard level 
under consideration would not be 
affected by the standard. 
DOE made the same assumption 
regarding forecasted standards-case 
efficiencies as for the base case; namely, 
that efficiencies will remain at the 2014 
standby power level until the end of the 
forecast period. By maintaining the 
same rate of increase for forecasted 
efficiencies in the standards case as in 
the base case (i.e., no change), DOE 
retained a constant efficiency difference 
between the two cases throughout the 
forecast period. Although the no-change 
trends may not reflect what would 
happen to base-case and standards-case 
product efficiencies in the future, DOE 
believes that maintaining a constant 
efficiency difference between the base 
case and each standards case provides a 
reasonable estimate of the impact that 
standards would have on product 
efficiency. It is more important to 
accurately estimate the efficiency 
difference between the standards case 
and base case than to accurately 
estimate the actual product efficiencies 
in the standards and base cases. DOE 
retained the approach used in the 
October 2008 NOPR for today’s SNOPR. 
Because the effective date of the 
standard is now assumed to be 2014, 
DOE applied the ‘‘roll-up’’ scenario in 
the year 2014 to establish the SWEF for 
each standards case. 
b. Annual Energy Consumption 
The annual energy consumption per 
unit depends directly on product 
efficiency. For the October 2008 NOPR 
and today’s SNOPR, DOE used the 
SWEFs associated with the base case 
and each standards case, in combination 
with the annual energy use data, to 
estimate the shipment-weighted average 
annual per-unit energy consumption 
under the base case and standards cases. 
The national energy consumption is the 
product of the annual energy 
consumption per unit and the number 
of units of each vintage, which depends 
on shipments. 
As noted above, DOE used a relative 
price elasticity to estimate standards- 
case shipments for microwave ovens. To 
avoid the inclusion of energy savings 
from any reduction in shipments 
attributable to a standard, DOE used the 
standards-case shipments projection 
and the standards-case stock to calculate 
the annual energy consumption in the 
base case. For microwave ovens, DOE 
assumed that any drop in shipments 
caused by standards would result in the 
purchase of used machines. DOE 
retained the use of the base-case 
shipments to determine the annual 
energy consumption in the base case for 
today’s SNOPR. 
c. Site-to-Source Energy Conversion 
To estimate the national energy 
savings expected from appliance 
standards, DOE uses a multiplicative 
factor to convert site energy 
consumption (energy use at the location 
where the appliance is operated) into 
primary or source energy consumption 
(the energy required to deliver the site 
energy). For the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE used annual site-to-source 
conversion factors based on the version 
of NEMS that corresponds to AEO 2008. 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE used AEO 
2010. For electricity, the conversion 
factors vary over time because of 
projected changes in generation sources 
(i.e., the types of power plants projected 
to provide electricity to the country). 
Because the AEO does not provide 
energy forecasts beyond 2035, DOE used 
conversion factors that remain constant 
at the 2035 values throughout the rest of 
the forecast. 
d. Total Installed Costs and Operating 
Costs 
The increase in total annual installed 
cost is equal to the difference in the per- 
unit total installed cost between the 
base case and standards case, multiplied 
by the shipments forecasted in the 
standards case. 
In the NOPR analysis, DOE assumed 
that the manufacturer costs and retail 
prices of products meeting various 
efficiency levels remain fixed, in real 
terms, throughout the period of the 
analysis. As discussed in section IV.F.1, 
examination of historical price data for 
certain appliances that have been 
subject to energy conservation standards 
indicates that the assumption of 
constant real prices and costs may, in 
many cases, over-estimate long-term 
appliance price trends. 
For the SNOPR, DOE applied a 
learning rate of 28.9 percent to forecast 
the prices of microwave ovens sold in 
each year in the forecast period (2014– 
2043). The learning rate expresses the 
change in price associated with a 
doubling in cumulative production. The 
price in each year is a function of the 
learning rate and the cumulative 
production of microwave ovens forecast 
in each year. DOE applied the same 
values to forecast prices for each 
product class at each considered 
efficiency level. Learning curve analysis 
characterizes the reduction in 
production cost mainly associated with 
labor-based performance improvement 
and higher investment in new capital 
equipment at the microeconomic level. 
Experience curve analysis tends to focus 
more on entire industries and aggregates 
over various casual factors at the 
macroeconomic level: ‘‘Experience 
curve’’ and ‘‘progress function’’ 
typically represent generalizations of 
the learning concept to encompass 
behavior of all inputs to production and 
cost (i.e., labor, capital, and materials).’’ 
The economic literature often uses these 
two terms interchangeably. The term

‘‘learning’’ is used here to broadly cover 
these general macroeconomic concepts. 
The ‘‘experience’’ curve developed for 
microwave ovens is based solely on 
shipments and PPI data specific to the 
United States. Because all microwave 
ovens are manufactured outside of the 
country, the changes observed in the PPI 
data are a result of efficiency gains 
realized in production outside of the 
country. In other words, ‘‘experience’’ is 
currently a dynamic of global 
production and distribution and is the 
cause for the changes observed in the 
PPI data. 
To evaluate the impact of the 
uncertainty of the price trend estimates, 
DOE performed price trend sensitivity 
calculations to examine the dependence 
of the analysis results on different 
analytical assumptions. DOE considered 
four learning rate sensitivities: (1) A 
‘‘high learning’’ rate (34.7 percent); (2) 
a ‘‘low learning’’ rate (21.3 percent); (3) 
a ‘‘no learning’’ rate (constant real 
prices); and (4) a ‘‘microwave oven 
only’’ rate. The ‘‘microwave oven only’’ 
is based on a limited set of historical 
price data specifically for microwave 
ovens, and the learning rate is 39.6 
percent. 
The annual operating cost savings per 
unit include changes in energy, repair, 
and maintenance costs. DOE forecasted 
energy prices for the October 2008 
NOPR based on AEO 2008; it updated 
the forecasts for the SNOPR using data 
from AEO 2010. For the October 2008 
NOPR and today’s SNOPR, DOE 
assumed no increases in repair and 
maintenance costs for more efficient 
standby mode and off mode features of 
microwave ovens. 
e. Discount Rates 
DOE multiplies monetary values in 
future years by a discount factor to 
determine their present value. DOE 
estimated national impacts using both a 
3-percent and a 7-percent real discount 
rate, in accordance with guidance 
provided by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) to Federal agencies 
on the development of regulatory 
analysis (OMB Circular A–4 (Sept.17, 
2003), section E, ‘‘Identifying and 
Measuring Benefits and Costs’’). The 
Joint Comment stated that DOE should 
use a 2-percent to 3-percent real 
discount rate for national impact 
analyses. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 
11) It noted that societal discount rates 
are the subject of extensive academic 
research, and the weight of academic 
opinion is that the appropriate societal 
discount rate is 3 percent or less. It 
urged DOE to give primary weight to 
results based on the lower of the 
discount rates recommended by OMB. 
In response, DOE notes that OMB 
Circular A–4 references an earlier 
Circular A–94, which states that a real 
discount rate of 7 percent should be 
used as a base case for regulatory 
analysis. The 7-percent rate is an 
estimate of the average before-tax rate of 
return to private capital in the U.S. 
economy. It approximates the 
opportunity cost of capital, and, 
according to Circular A–94, it is the 
appropriate discount rate whenever the 
primary effect of a regulation is to 
displace or alter the use of capital in the 
private sector. OMB later found that the 
average rate of return to capital remains 
near the 7-percent rate estimated in 
1992. Circular A–4 also states that when 
regulation primarily and directly affects 
private consumption, a lower discount 
rate is appropriate. ‘‘The alternative 
most often used is sometimes called the 
social rate of time preference * * * the 
rate at which ‘society’ discounts future 
consumption flows to their present 
value.’’ It suggests that the real rate of 
return on long-term government debt 
may provide a fair approximation of the 
social rate of time preference, and states 
that during the past 30 years, this rate 
has averaged around 3 percent in real 
terms on a pre-tax basis. It concludes 
that ‘‘for regulatory analysis, [agencies] 
should provide estimates of net benefits 
using both 3 percent and 7 percent.’’ In 
accordance with the guidance from 
OMB Circular A–4, DOE did not give 
primary weight to results derived using 
a 3-percent discount rate. 
5. Effects of Standards on Energy Prices 
The Joint Comment stated that the 
proposed standard’s mitigation effects 
on electricity prices should be 
documented and the value of reduced 
electricity bills to all consumers 
quantified as a benefit. (Joint Comment, 
No. 44 at p. 11) For the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE examined the impact of 
reduced energy demand associated with 
possible cooking products standards on 
prices of electricity. DOE found that 
reductions in electricity demand 
resulting from possible standards for 
cooking products would produce no 
detectable change on the average user 
price of electricity in the United States. 
DOE concluded that microwave oven 
standby mode and off mode standards 
will not provide additional economic 
benefits resulting from lower energy 
prices. Thus, for today’s SNOPR DOE 
has made no change to its assumptions 
about the effects of microwave oven 
standards on energy prices. 
F. Consumer Subgroup Analysis 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
analyzed the potential effects of 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode standards on two subgroups: 
(1) Low-income consumers, and 
(2) consumers living in senior-only 
households. DOE used the same 
approach for today’s SNOPR. 
G. Manufacturer Impact Analysis 
DOE performed an MIA to estimate 
the financial impact of standby mode 
and off mode energy conservation 
standards on microwave oven 
manufacturers, and to calculate the 
impact of such standards on domestic 
employment and manufacturing 
capacity. The MIA has both quantitative 
and qualitative aspects. The quantitative 
part of the MIA primarily relies on the 
GRIM—an industry-cash-flow model 
customized for this rulemaking. The 
GRIM inputs are data characterizing the 
industry cost structure, shipments, and 
revenues. The key output is the industry 
net present value. Different sets of 
assumptions (scenarios) will produce 
different results. The qualitative part of 
the MIA addresses factors such as 
product characteristics, characteristics 
of particular firms, and market and 
product trends, and it also includes an 
assessment of the impacts of standards 
on subgroups of manufacturers. DOE 
outlined its methodology for the MIA in 
the October 2008 NOPR. 73 FR 62034, 
62075–81 (Oct. 17, 2008). The complete 
MIA is presented in chapter 12 of the 
SNOPR TSD. 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE updated the 
MIA results based on several changes to 
other analyses that impact the MIA. 
DOE revised the analysis to account for 
the impacts on manufacturers resulting 
from standby mode and off mode 
standards for Product Class 1 
(Microwave-Only Ovens and Countertop 
Combination Microwave Ovens) and 
Product Class 2 (Built-In and Over-the- 
Range Combination Microwave Ovens). 
As discussed in section IV.C.3, based on 
the engineering analysis, DOE included 
updated manufacturer production costs 
(MPCs) for Product Class 1 and new 
MPCs for Product Class 2. For the 
SNOPR DOE updated its engineering 
analysis to 2010$ using the PPI. DOE 
also incorporated price trends into the 
analysis. Incorporating prices trends 
rather than assuming prices remain 
fixed in real terms throughout the 
analysis also impacts the MIA results. 
DOE used the default prices trends in 
the NIA starting in the base year of the 
analysis (2011) and continuing through 
the end of the analysis period (2043). 
DOE also assumed that MPCs and MSPs 
were similarly impacted by price trends 
in both the base case and standards 
cases. See section IV.D.1 for a

description of how DOE implemented 
prices trends into the analysis. 
The total shipments and efficiency 
distributions were updated using the 
new estimates outlined in the SNOPR 
NIA. The MIA also uses the new 
analysis period in the NIA (2013–2043) 
and has updated the base year to 2011. 
See section IV.E for a description of the 
changes to the NIA. 
To segment total product and capital 
conversion costs between Product Class 
1 and Product Class 2, DOE used the 
same split between these two product 
classes as used in the NIA. DOE used 
the same per-platform costs at each 
standby power level for both product 
classes, but converted these product and 
capital conversion costs to 2010$ using 
the PPI. As described below, DOE also 
updated the product conversion costs in 
response to comments from interested 
parties. 
As noted in section IV.C.2, Whirlpool 
commented that its market research 
suggests high costs associated with 
consumer education on proper 
operation of microwave ovens with 
automatic power-down features. 
Whirlpool clarified that the marketing 
costs it submitted for the ANOPR did 
not include these costs, estimated at $10 
million, including retailer training, 
point-of-purchase material, product 
tags, telephone support, and possibly 
more. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 7) AHAM 
also commented that DOE did not 
account for the all cost implications on 
appliance manufacturers, including 
variables such as component reliability 
and/or utility, both of which will impact 
manufacturer cost. (AHAM, No. 47 at p. 
6) 
As part of the MIA conducted for the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE considered 
product and capital conversion costs 
associated with the analyzed TSLs. 
Product conversion costs are one-time 
investments in research, development, 
testing, and marketing, focused on 
making product designs comply with 
new energy conservation standards. 
DOE investigated available product 
information to estimate the number of 
product platforms that would need to be 
updated at each TSL to determine 
conversion costs for the entire industry. 
DOE also used manufacturer interviews 
to verify the estimates used to determine 
product conversion costs. For each TSL, 
DOE assumed that most of the product 
conversion costs would be used for 
product development expenses. To 
account for the majority of the cost to 
upgrade the designs of product 
platforms that did not meet the standby 
power requirements at each TSL, DOE 
estimated a per-platform cost for 
engineering time, reliability testing, and 
product development that varied 
depending on the complexity of the 
design options. In response to 
Whirlpool’s comment, DOE notes that 
the normal product cycle of microwave 
ovens is less the 3-year period between 
the announcement and the compliance 
date of the final rule, and some of these 
marketing costs for rolling-out new 
products would have been incurred 
without standards. However, to 
conservatively account for any of these 
extraordinary marketing costs in that 
period, DOE also estimated for the 
SNOPR a per-platform cost where it 
analyzed a power-down design option 
to achieve the required standby power 
level. The marketing cost equaled half 
the estimated engineering expense per 
platform. Chapter 12 of the SNOPR TSD 
contains more detailed information on 
the product conversion costs for 
microwave oven manufacturers. 
DOE also received a comment about 
the MIA results during the October 2008 
NOPR public meeting. In response to a 
discussion about different possible 
design paths that might be taken by 
manufacturers to reach higher 
efficiencies, LG questioned why the 
range of impacts on INPV was great if 
DOE had trouble contacting some 
overseas manufacturers. (LG, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 167– 
169). 
Additional information and 
interviewing a greater number of 
manufacturers would not affect the 
range of INPV impacts shown in the 
NOPR. Rather, the range of potential 
impacts on microwave oven 
manufacturers in the NOPR MIA 
analysis depended on two factors: The 
magnitude of the conversion costs and 
the ability of manufacturers to pass 
through the additional production costs 
to consumers at higher TSLs. The 
production cost at the max-tech standby 
power level (TSL 4) in the NOPR added 
$5.13 to the baseline MPC. If 
manufacturers could fully pass through 
these additional production costs to 
consumers for lower standby power, the 
additional cash flow from operations in 
the NOPR MIA analysis would still not 
be enough to overcome the substantial 
product and capital conversion costs, 
resulting in a loss of $35 million in 
INPV. If manufacturers could only pass 
through a portion of the increased 
production costs, the lower per-unit 
profit lowered cash flow from 
operations and resulted in a loss of $172 
million in INPV. 73 FR 62034, 62096– 
99 (Oct. 17, 2008). Hence, feedback from 
manufacturers was valuable to 
determine the standby power 
conversion costs and to determine 
which scenarios were appropriate to 
calculate the potential impacts on INPV. 
H. Employment Impact Analysis 
DOE considers employment impacts 
in the domestic economy as one factor 
in selecting a proposed standard. 
Employment impacts include direct and 
indirect impacts. Direct employment 
impacts are changes in the number of 
employees for manufacturers of the 
products subject to standards, their 
suppliers, and related service firms. The 
MIA addresses those impacts. Indirect 
employment impacts from standards 
consist of the jobs created or eliminated 
in the national economy, other than in 
the manufacturing sector being 
regulated, due to: (1) Reduced spending 
on energy by end users, (2) reduced 
spending on new energy supply by the 
utility industry, (3) increased consumer 
spending on the purchase of new 
products, and (4) the effects of those 
three factors throughout the economy. 
One method for assessing the possible 
effects such shifts in economic activity 
may have on the demand for labor is to 
compare sectoral employment statistics 
developed by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS). BLS regularly publishes 
its estimates of the number of jobs per 
million dollars of economic activity in 
different sectors of the economy, as well 
as the jobs created elsewhere in the 
economy by that same economic 
activity. Data from BLS indicate that 
expenditures in the utility sector 
generally create fewer jobs (both directly 
and indirectly) than do expenditures in 
other sectors of the economy.20 There 
are many reasons for the differences, 
including wage differences and the fact 
that the utility sector is more capital- 
intensive and less labor-intensive than 
many other sectors. Energy conservation 
standards have the effect of reducing 
consumer utility bills. Because reduced 
consumer expenditures for energy likely 
lead to increased expenditures in other 
sectors of the economy, the general 
effect of energy conservation standards 
is to shift economic activity from a less 
labor-intensive sector (i.e., the utility 
sector) to more labor-intensive sectors 
(e.g., the retail and manufacturing 
sectors). Thus, based on the BLS data 
alone, DOE believes net national 
employment will increase due to shifts 
in economic activity resulting from new 
standby mode and off mode standards 
for microwave ovens. 
In developing the October 2008 NOPR 
and today’s SNOPR, DOE estimated

economy called Impact of Sector Energy 
Technologies version 3.1.1 (ImSET). 
ImSET is a special-purpose version of 
the U.S. Benchmark National Input- 
Output (I–O) model designed to 
estimate the national employment and 
income effects of energy-saving 
technologies. The ImSET software 
includes a computer-based I–O model 
having structural coefficients to 
characterize economic flows among 187 
sectors most relevant to industrial, 
commercial, and residential building 
energy use. 
DOE notes that ImSET is not a general 
equilibrium forecasting model, and 
understands the uncertainties involved 
in projecting employment impacts, 
especially changes in the later years of 
the analysis.4 Because ImSET does not 
incorporate price changes, the 
employment effects predicted by ImSET 
may over-estimate actual job impacts 
over the long run for this rule. Because 
ImSET predicts small job impacts 
resulting from this rule, regardless of 
these uncertainties, the actual job 
impacts are likely to be negligible in the 
overall economy. DOE may consider the 
use of other modeling approaches for 
examining long run employment 
impacts. DOE also notes that the 
employment impacts estimated with 
ImSET for the entire economy differ 
from the employment impacts in the 
microwaves manufacturing sector 
estimated using the Government 
Regulatory Impact Model (GRIM) in 
chapter 12 of the TSD. The 
methodologies used and the sectors 
analyzed in the ImSET and GRIM 
models are different. Please see chapter 
13 of the TSD for additional details on 
the range of results generated from the 
ImSET model. 
EJ and the Joint Comment stated that 
DOE must consider its own projections 
that an increase in employment will 
result from the adoption of standards in 
weighing the economic costs and 
benefits of more stringent energy 
conservation standards. (EJ Comment, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 
186; Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 13) As 
described above, when evaluating 
alternative standard levels DOE 
considers the indirect employment 
impacts estimated using ImSet. Direct 
employment impacts on the 
manufacturers that produce microwave 
ovens are analyzed in the MIA, as 
discussed in section IV.G. For today’s 
SNOPR, DOE made no change to its 
method for estimating employment 
impacts. EEI requested clarification on 
the methodology used to estimate the 
national employment impacts when the 
majority of microwave ovens are 
manufactured overseas. (EEI, Public 
Meeting Transcript at p. 185) The 
employment impacts analysis considers 
only the indirect employment impacts 
expected to result from appliance 
standards. The employment impacts in 
the affected appliance manufacturing 
industry are assessed in the MIA. For 
the purposes of the employment 
impacts analysis described in this 
section, the location of the 
manufacturing facilities is not relevant. 
For further details, see chapter 13 of the 
SNOPR TSD. 
I. Utility Impact Analysis 
The utility impact analysis estimates 
the change in the forecasted power 
generation capacity for the Nation that 
would be expected to result from 
adoption of new or amended standards. 
The analysis determines the changes to 
electricity supply as a result of 
electricity consumption savings due to 
standards. For the October 2008 NOPR 
and today’s SNOPR, DOE used the 
NEMS–BT computer model to calculate 
these changes. The analysis output 
provides a forecast for the needed 
generation capacities at each TSL. The 
estimated net benefit of a standard is the 
difference between the generation 
capacities forecasted by NEMS–BT and 
the AEO Reference case. DOE obtained 
the energy savings inputs from the NIA. 
Those inputs reflect the effects of 
standby mode and off mode energy use 
reduction on electricity consumption of 
microwave ovens. Chapter 14 of the 
SNOPR TSD presents results of the 
utility impact analysis. 
J. Emissions Analysis 
In the emissions analysis, DOE 
estimated the reduction in power sector 
emissions of CO2, NOX, and Hg from 
energy conservation standards for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use. DOE used the NEMS– 
BT computer model, which is run 
similarly to the AEO NEMS, except that 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use is reduced by the 
amount of energy saved at each TSL. 
The inputs of national energy savings 
come from the NIA spreadsheet model, 
while the output is the forecasted 
physical emissions. The net benefit of 
each TSL in today’s proposed rule is the 
difference between the forecasted 
emissions estimated by NEMS–BT at 
each TSL and the AEO 2010 Reference 
case. NEMS–BT tracks CO2 emissions 
using a detailed module that provides 
results with broad coverage of all sectors 
and inclusion of interactive effects. For 
today’s SNOPR, DOE used AEO 2010. 
For the final rule, DOE intends to revise 
the emissions analysis using the most 
current version of NEMS. 
SO2 emissions from affected electric 
generating units (EGUs) are subject to 
nationwide and regional emissions cap 
and trading programs, and DOE has 
preliminarily determined that these 
programs create uncertainty about the 
standards’ impact on SO2 emissions. 
Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets an 
annual emissions cap on SO2 for 
affected EGUs in all 50 States and the 
District of Columbia (DC). SO2 
emissions from 28 eastern States and DC 
are also limited under the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR, 70 FR 25162 (May 
12, 2005)), which created an allowance- 
based trading program that would 
gradually replace the Title IV program 
in those States and DC. Although CAIR 
was remanded to EPA by the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit (DC Circuit), see North Carolina 
v. EPA, 550 F.3d 1176 (DC Cir. 2008), 
it remained in effect temporarily, 
consistent with the DC Circuit’s earlier 
opinion in North Carolina v. EPA, 531 
F.3d 896 (DC Cir. 2008). On July 6, 
2010, EPA issued the Transport Rule 
proposal, a replacement for CAIR (75 FR 
45210 (Aug. 2, 2010)); and on July 6, 
2011 EPA issued the final Transport 
Rule, entitled the Cross-State Air 
Pollution Rule. 76 FR 48208 (Aug. 8, 
2011). On December 30, 2011, however, 
the DC Circuit stayed the new rules 
while a panel of judges reviews them, 
and told EPA to continue enforcing 
CAIR (see EME Homer City Generation 
v. EPA, No. 11–1302, Order at *2 (DC 
Cir. Dec. 30, 2011)). The AEO 2011 
NEMS–BT used for today’s NOPR 
assumes the implementation of CAIR. 
The attainment of emissions caps 
typically is flexible among EGUs and is 
enforced through the use of emissions 
allowances and tradable permits. Under 
existing EPA regulations, any excess 
SO2 emissions allowances resulting 
from the lower electricity demand 
caused by the imposition of an energy 
conservation standard could be used to 
permit offsetting increases in SO2 
emissions by any regulated EGU. 
However, if the standard resulted in a 
permanent increase in the quantity of 
unused emissions allowances, there 
would be an overall reduction in SO2 
emissions from the standards. While 
there remains some uncertainty about 
the ultimate effects of energy 
conservation standards on SO2 
emissions covered by the existing cap- 
and-trade system, the NEMS–BT 
modeling system that DOE uses to 
forecast emissions reductions currently 
indicates that no physical reductions in 
power sector emissions would occur for 
SO2.

8553 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
21 National Research Council. ‘‘Hidden Costs of 
Energy: Unpriced Consequences of Energy 
Production and Use.’’ National Academies Press: 
Washington, DC 2009. 
As discussed above, the version of 
NEMS–BT used for today’s SNOPR 
assumes the implementation of CAIR, 
which established a cap on NOX 
emissions in 28 eastern States and the 
District of Columbia. With CAIR in 
effect, the energy conservation 
standards for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode energy use are 
expected to have little or no physical 
effect on these emissions in those States 
covered by CAIR, for the same reasons 
that they may have little effect on SO2 
emissions. However, the standards 
would be expected to reduce NOX 
emissions in those 22 States not affected 
by the CAIR. For these 22 States, DOE 
used NEMS–BT to estimate NOX 
emission reductions from the standards 
that are considered in today’s SNOPR. 
On December 21, 2011, EPA 
announced national emissions 
standards for hazardous air pollutants 
(NESHAPs) for mercury and certain 
other pollutants emitted from coal and 
oil-fired EGUs. (See http://epa.gov/ 
mats/pdfs/20111216MATSfinal.pdf.) 
The NESHAPs do not include a trading 
program and, as such, DOE’s energy 
conservation standards would likely 
reduce Hg emissions. For the emissions 
analysis for this rulemaking, DOE 
estimated mercury emissions reductions 
using NEMS–BT based on AEO2010, 
which does not incorporate the 
NESHAPs. DOE expects that future 
versions of the NEMS–BT model will 
reflect the implementation of the 
NESHAPs. 
K. Monetizing Carbon Dioxide and 
Other Emissions Impacts 
As part of the development of this 
proposed rule, DOE considered the 
estimated monetary benefits likely to 
result from the reduced emissions of 
CO2 and NOX that are expected to result 
from each of the TSLs considered. In 
order to make this calculation similar to 
the calculation of the NPV of consumer 
benefit, DOE considered the reduced 
emissions expected to result over the 
lifetime of products shipped in the 
forecast period for each TSL. This 
section summarizes the basis for the 
monetary values used for each of these 
emissions and presents the values 
considered in this rulemaking. 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE is relying on 
a set of values for the SCC that was 
developed by an interagency process. A 
summary of the basis for those values is 
provided below, and a more detailed 
description of the methodologies used is 
provided as an appendix to chapter 16 
of the SNOPR TSD. 
1. Social Cost of Carbon 
Under section 1(b)(6) of Executive 
Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 
1993), agencies must, to the extent 
permitted by law, ‘‘assess both the costs 
and the benefits of the intended 
regulation and, recognizing that some 
costs and benefits are difficult to 
quantify, propose or adopt a regulation 
only upon a reasoned determination 
that the benefits of the intended 
regulation justify its costs.’’ The purpose 
of the SCC estimates presented here is 
to allow agencies to incorporate the 
monetized social benefits of reducing 
CO2 emissions into cost-benefit analyses 
of regulatory actions that have small, or 
‘‘marginal,’’ impacts on cumulative 
global emissions. The estimates are 
presented with an acknowledgement of 
the many uncertainties involved and 
with a clear understanding that they 
should be updated over time to reflect 
increasing knowledge of the science and 
economics of climate impacts. 
As part of the interagency process that 
developed the SCC estimates, technical 
experts from numerous agencies met on 
a regular basis to consider public 
comments, explore the technical 
literature in relevant fields, and discuss 
key model inputs and assumptions. The 
main objective of this process was to 
develop a range of SCC values using a 
defensible set of input assumptions 
grounded in the existing scientific and 
economic literatures. In this way, key 
uncertainties and model differences 
transparently and consistently inform 
the range of SCC estimates used in the 
rulemaking process. 
a. Monetizing Carbon Dioxide Emissions 
The SCC is an estimate of the 
monetized damages associated with an 
incremental increase in carbon 
emissions in a given year. It is intended 
to include (but is not limited to) changes 
in net agricultural productivity, human 
health, property damages from 
increased flood risk, and the value of 
ecosystem services. Estimates of the 
SCC are provided in dollars per metric 
ton of carbon dioxide. 
When attempting to assess the 
incremental economic impacts of carbon 
dioxide emissions, the analyst faces a 
number of serious challenges. A recent 
report from the National Research 
Council 21 points out that any 
assessment will suffer from uncertainty, 
speculation, and lack of information 
about (1) future emissions of greenhouse 
gases, (2) the effects of past and future 
emissions on the climate system, (3) the 
impact of changes in climate on the 
physical and biological environment, 
and (4) the translation of these 
environmental impacts into economic 
damages. As a result, any effort to 
quantify and monetize the harms 
associated with climate change will 
raise serious questions of science, 
economics, and ethics and should be 
viewed as provisional. 
Despite the serious limits of both 
quantification and monetization, SCC 
estimates can be useful in estimating the 
social benefits of reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions. Consistent with the 
directive quoted above, the purpose of 
the SCC estimates presented here is to 
make it possible for agencies to 
incorporate the social benefits from 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions into 
cost-benefit analyses of regulatory 
actions that have small, or ‘‘marginal,’’ 
impacts on cumulative global emissions. 
Most Federal regulatory actions can be 
expected to have marginal impacts on 
global emissions. 
For such policies, the agency can 
estimate the benefits from reduced (or 
costs from increased) emissions in any 
future year by multiplying the change in 
emissions in that year by the SCC value 
appropriate for that year. The net 
present value of the benefits can then be 
calculated by multiplying each of these 
future benefits by an appropriate 
discount factor and summing across all 
affected years. This approach assumes 
that the marginal damages from 
increased emissions are constant for 
small departures from the baseline 
emissions path, an approximation that 
is reasonable for policies that have 
effects on emissions that are small 
relative to cumulative global carbon 
dioxide emissions. For policies that 
have a large (non-marginal) impact on 
global cumulative emissions, there is a 
separate question of whether the SCC is 
an appropriate tool for calculating the 
benefits of reduced emissions. This 
concern is not applicable to this notice, 
and DOE does not attempt to answer 
that question here. 
At the time of the preparation of this 
supplemental notice, the most recent 
interagency estimates of the potential 
global benefits resulting from reduced 
CO2 emissions in 2010, expressed in 
2010$, were $4.9, $22.3, $36.5, and 
$67.6 per metric ton avoided. For 
emissions reductions that occur in later 
years, these values grow in real terms 
over time. Additionally, the interagency 
group determined that a range of values 
from 7 percent to 23 percent should be 
used to adjust the global SCC to

22 It is recognized that this calculation for 
domestic values is approximate, provisional, and 
highly speculative. There is no a priori reason why 
domestic benefits should be a constant fraction of 
net global damages over time. 
23 The models are described in appendix 15–A of 
the SNOPR TSD. 
calculate domestic effects,22 although 
preference is given to consideration of 
the global benefits of reducing CO2 
emissions. 
It is important to emphasize that the 
interagency process is committed to 
updating these estimates as the science 
and economic understanding of climate 
change and its impacts on society 
improves over time. Specifically, the 
interagency group has set a preliminary 
goal of revisiting the SCC values within 
2 years or at such time as substantially 
updated models become available, and 
to continue to support research in this 
area. In the meantime, the interagency 
group will continue to explore the 
issues raised by this analysis and 
consider public comments as part of the 
ongoing interagency process. 
b. Social Cost of Carbon Values Used in 
Past Regulatory Analyses 
To date, economic analyses for 
Federal regulations have used a wide 
range of values to estimate the benefits 
associated with reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions. In the model year 2011 CAFE 
final rule, the Department of 
Transportation (DOT) used both a 
‘‘domestic’’ SCC value of $2 per ton of 
CO2 and a ‘‘global’’ SCC value of $33 per 
ton of CO2 for 2007 emission reductions 
(in 2007$), increasing both values at 2.4 
percent per year. It also included a 
sensitivity analysis at $80 per ton of 
CO2. See Average Fuel Economy 
Standards Passenger Cars and Light 
Trucks Model Year 2011, 74 FR 14196 
(March 30, 2009) (Final Rule); Final 
Environmental Impact Statement 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
Standards, Passenger Cars and Light 
Trucks, Model Years 2011–2015 at 3–90 
(Oct. 2008) (Available at: http:// 
www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy). A 
domestic SCC value is meant to reflect 
the value of damages in the United 
States resulting from a unit change in 
carbon dioxide emissions, while a 
global SCC value is meant to reflect the 
value of damages worldwide. 
A 2008 regulation proposed by DOT 
assumed a domestic SCC value of $7 per 
ton of CO2 (in 2006$) for 2011 emission 
reductions (with a range of $0 to $14 for 
sensitivity analysis), also increasing at 
2.4 percent per year. See Average Fuel 
Economy Standards, Passenger Cars

Cars and Light Trucks, Model Years 
2011–2015 at 3–58 (June 2008) 
(Available at: http://www.nhtsa.gov/ 
fuel-economy). A regulation for 
packaged terminal air conditioners and 
packaged terminal heat pumps finalized 
by DOE in October of 2008 used a 
domestic SCC range of $0 to $20 per ton 
CO2 for 2007 emission reductions (in 
2007$). 73 FR 58772, 58814 (Oct. 7, 
2008). In addition, EPA’s 2008 Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Under the Clean Air Act identified what 
it described as ‘‘very preliminary’’ SCC 
estimates subject to revision. 73 FR 
44354 (July 30, 2008). EPA’s global 
mean values were $68 and $40 per ton 
CO2 for discount rates of approximately 
2 percent and 3 percent, respectively (in 
2006$ for 2007 emissions). 
In 2009, an interagency process was 
initiated to offer a preliminary 
assessment of how best to quantify the 
benefits from reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions. To ensure consistency in 
how benefits are evaluated across 
agencies, the Administration sought to 
develop a transparent and defensible 
method, specifically designed for the 
rulemaking process, to quantify avoided 
climate change damages from reduced 
CO2 emissions. The interagency group 
did not undertake any original analysis. 
Instead, it combined SCC estimates from 
the existing literature to use as interim 
values until a more comprehensive 
analysis could be conducted. The 
outcome of the preliminary assessment 
by the interagency group was a set of 
five interim values: Global SCC 
estimates for 2007 (in 2006$) of $55, 
$33, $19, $10, and $5 per ton of CO2. 
These interim values represent the first 
sustained interagency effort within the 
U.S. government to develop an SCC for 
use in regulatory analysis. The results of 
this preliminary effort were presented in 
several proposed and final rules and 
were offered for public comment in 
connection with proposed rules, 
including the joint EPA–DOT fuel 
economy and CO2 tailpipe emission 
proposed rules. 
c. Current Approach and Key 
Assumptions 
Since the release of the interim 
values, the interagency group 
reconvened on a regular basis to 
generate improved SCC estimates, 
which were considered for this 
proposed rule. Specifically, the group 
considered public comments and 
further explored the technical literature 
in relevant fields. The interagency group 
relied on three integrated assessment 
models (IAMs) commonly used to 
estimate the SCC: The FUND, DICE, and 
PAGE models.23 These models are 
frequently cited in the peer-reviewed 
literature and were used in the last 
assessment of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. Each model 
was given equal weight in the SCC 
values that were developed. 
Each model takes a slightly different 
approach to model how changes in 
emissions result in changes in economic 
damages. A key objective of the 
interagency process was to enable a 
consistent exploration of the three 
models while respecting the different 
approaches to quantifying damages 
taken by the key modelers in the field. 
An extensive review of the literature 
was conducted to select three sets of 
input parameters for these models: 
climate sensitivity, socio-economic and 
emissions trajectories, and discount 
rates. A probability distribution for 
climate sensitivity was specified as an 
input into all three models. In addition, 
the interagency group used a range of 
scenarios for the socio-economic 
parameters and a range of values for the 
discount rate. All other model features 
were left unchanged, relying on the 
model developers’ best estimates and 
judgments. 
The interagency group selected four 
SCC values for use in regulatory 
analyses. Three values are based on the 
average SCC from three integrated 
assessment models, at discount rates of 
2.5 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent. 
The fourth value, which represents the 
95th percentile SCC estimate across all 
three models at a 3-percent discount 
rate, is included to represent higher- 
than-expected impacts from temperature 
change further out in the tails of the 
SCC distribution. For emissions (or 
emission reductions) that occur in later 
years, these values grow in real terms 
over time, as depicted in Table IV.11.

It is important to recognize that a 
number of key uncertainties remain, and 
that current SCC estimates should be 
treated as provisional and revisable 
since they will evolve with improved 
scientific and economic understanding. 
The interagency group also recognizes 
that the existing models are imperfect 
and incomplete. The National Research 
Council report mentioned above points 
out that there is tension between the 
goal of producing quantified estimates 
of the economic damages from an 
incremental ton of carbon and the limits 
of existing efforts to model these effects. 
There are a number of concerns and 
problems that should be addressed by 
the research community, including 
research programs housed in many of 
the agencies participating in the 
interagency process to estimate the SCC. 
DOE recognizes the uncertainties 
embedded in the estimates of the SCC 
used for cost-benefit analyses. As such, 
DOE and others in the U.S. Government 
intend to periodically review and 
reconsider those estimates to reflect 
increasing knowledge of the science and 
economics of climate impacts, as well as 
improvements in modeling. In this 
context, statements recognizing the 
limitations of the analysis and calling 
for further research take on exceptional 
significance. 
In summary, in considering the 
potential global benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 emissions, DOE used the 
most recent values identified by the 
interagency process, adjusted to 2010$ 
using the GDP price deflator. For each 
of the four cases specified, the values 
used for emissions in 2010 were $4.9, 
$22.3, $36.5, and $67.6 per metric ton 
avoided (values expressed in 2010$).24 
To monetize the CO2 emissions 
reductions expected to result from 
amended standards for microwave 
ovens, DOE used the values identified 
in Table A1 of the ‘‘Social Cost of 
Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 
Under Executive Order 12866,’’ which 
is reprinted in appendix 16–A of the 
SNOPR TSD, appropriately escalated to 
2010$. To calculate a present value of 
the stream of monetary values, DOE 
discounted the values in each of the 
four cases using the specific discount 
rate that had been used to obtain the 
SCC values in each case. 
Several parties provided comments 
regarding the economic valuation of CO2 
for the October 2008 NOPR. Whirlpool 
does not support an attempt to value 
those emissions as part of this 
rulemaking. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 8) 
DOE believes that, in keeping with 
Executive Order 12866, placing an 
economic value on avoided CO2 
emissions is necessary for a proper 
assessment of the costs and benefits of 
energy efficiency standards. For this 
SNOPR, DOE has updated its valuation 
of emission reductions based on the 
most recent recommendations from the 
interagency group. DOE has considered 
a wide range of values per ton of 
avoided CO2. As stated previously, the 
estimates are presented with an 
acknowledgement of the many 
uncertainties involved and with a clear 
understanding that they should be 
updated over time to reflect increasing 
knowledge of the science and 
economics of climate impacts. 
2. Valuation of Other Emissions 
Reductions 
DOE investigated the potential 
monetary benefit of reduced NOX 
emissions from the TSLs it considered. 
As noted above, new or amended energy 
conservation standards would reduce 
NOX emissions in those 22 States that 
are not affected by the CAIR. DOE 
estimated the monetized value of NOX 
emissions reductions resulting from 
each of the TSLs considered for today’s 
SNOPR based on environmental damage 
estimates found in the relevant 
scientific literature. Available estimates 
suggest a very wide range of monetary 
values, ranging from $370 per ton to 
$3,800 per ton of NOX from stationary 
sources, measured in 2001$ (equivalent 
to a range of $450 to $4,623 per ton in 
2010$).25 In accordance with OMB 
guidance, DOE conducted two 
calculations of the monetary benefits 
derived using each of the economic 
values used for NOX, one using a real 
discount rate of 3 percent and the other 
using a real discount rate of 7 percent.26 
DOE is aware of multiple agency 
efforts to determine the appropriate 
range of values used in evaluating the 
potential economic benefits of reduced 
Hg emissions. DOE has decided to await 
further guidance regarding consistent 
valuation and reporting of Hg emissions 
before it once again monetizes Hg in its 
rulemakings. 
L. Discussion of Other Comments 
1. Off Mode Power Consumption 
In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
determined that a microwave oven 
would be considered to be in off mode 
if it is plugged in to a main power 
source, is not being used for an active 
function such as cooking or defrosting, 
and is not consuming power for any 
standby mode function. 73 FR 62034, 
62042 (Oct. 17, 2008). Hypothetically, a 
microwave with mechanical controls 
and no display or cooking sensor but 
that consumes power for components 
such as a power supply when the unit

27 Harmonics are waveforms of voltage or current 
that are multiples of the fundamental main power 
frequency. Harmonics can cause disruption to 
equipment connected to the main power and lead 
to component failures. 
is not activated would be considered to 
be in off mode. DOE believed no such 
microwave ovens were available on the 
market, and was unaware of any 
microwave ovens available that could 
operate in off mode. Therefore, DOE 
proposed no off-mode power 
consumption energy conservation 
standard. DOE requested input and data 
regarding off mode power for 
microwave ovens. 
Despite DOE’s test results indicating 
that no current microwave oven can 
operate in off mode, AHAM 
recommended that some level of power 
should be allowed in off mode for the 
following reasons: 
(1) Harmonization, particularly with 
Europe, which is implementing a 0.5 W 
standard on off mode in 2013; 
(2) Consistency in standby mode and 
off mode definitions among all NAECA- 
covered products; 
(3) Off mode and standby mode are 
linked, in that standby power 
requirements may result in previously 
unused features, such as a small LED 
indicating that power is running to the 
unit, but the unit is in standby mode; 
and 
(4) Power use and conversion 
concerns (i.e., harmonics 27) may 
necessitate some protective capability, 
which falls into the definition of off 
mode. 
AHAM urged DOE to consider 
adopting AHAM’s proposed 
clarifications and examples for off mode 
power included in Exhibit 1. These 
guidelines allow for a single definition 
to be used for all products. (AHAM, No. 
47 at p. 5) 
Whirlpool commented that the 
addition of off mode to the proposed 
rule is very important to assure that all 
power consumption is properly 
accounted for. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 
4) 
DOE generally agrees with the topics 
addressed in these comments. 
Consistency between covered products 
and international harmonization are 
important issues to be considered in 
energy conservation standards 
rulemakings, as is properly accounting 
for all power consumption. However, 
DOE received no comments indicating 
that any microwave ovens with off 
mode capability are currently available 
or expected to become available on the 
market. In the concurrent microwave 
oven test procedure rulemaking, DOE 
investigated the potential for microwave 
ovens with an on/off switch to operate 
in off mode. DOE determined that 
microwave ovens with such a 
configuration would be capable of 
operating in off mode, but that operation 
in off mode due to the activation of an 
on/off switch would be associated with 
zero energy consumption. Therefore, 
DOE continues to propose no standard 
for off mode power in microwave ovens 
because it believes there would be no 
benefit associated with such a standard. 
2. Proposed Standards for Microwave 
Oven Standby Mode and Off Mode 
Energy Use 
For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
made the preliminary determination 
that a maximum standby power 
standard of 1.0 W for microwave ovens 
is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. 73 FR 62034, 
62120 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE requested 
comments and views of interested 
parties on the proposed standards for 
microwave ovens. Id. at 62133. 
EEI stated that the proposed standard 
of 1.0 W is too aggressive because 
typical microwave ovens have standby 
power consumption of 2 to 4 W. This 
power is used for functions that 
consumers find useful (such as clocks 
and cooking sensors). EEI noted that 
DOE should work with AHAM to set a 
different standard that does not 
compromise functionality. EEI 
suggested a standard of 2.0 to 3.0 W, 
which should provide more flexibility 
to manufacturers and provide national 
energy savings. (EEI, No. 56 at p. 2) 
As discussed in the October 2008 
NOPR and this SNOPR, DOE is aware of 
various strategies manufacturers could 
employ to reduce standby power 
consumption while maintaining 
consumer utility. DOE’s analysis in 
today’s SNOPR indicates that a 1–W 
standard for microwave-only ovens and 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens would be technically feasible and 
economically justified. DOE is not 
proposing a 1–W standard for built-in 
and over-the-range combination 
microwave ovens because such a level 
was not found to be technically feasible 
while maintaining consumer utility (i.e., 
automatic power-down would be 
necessary to meet that standby power 
level). 
The Joint Comment and ASAP 
support the proposed standard. 
According to the Joint Comment, the 
proposal is in keeping with national and 
international efforts to limit product 
standby power. (Joint Comment, No. 44 
at p. 10; ASAP, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 32) 
AHAM stated that it believes all the 
TSLs are appropriate, including the TSL 
on which the proposed standard is 
based. AHAM stated that much of the 
world is moving towards the IEA 1– 
Watt Program. (AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 83) 
Nevertheless, AHAM stated its 
opposition to the proposed standard, 
due in part to the lack of sufficient time 
for manufacturers to evaluate the 
viability or feasibility of the proposed 
technologies. AHAM proposed that DOE 
issue a ‘‘no standard’’ standard on 
microwave ovens or postpone the 
current rulemaking on microwave oven 
standby power until a robust test 
procedure is published and data are 
collected using the clarified test 
procedure to define potential standby 
power requirements. If the ‘‘no 
standard’’ standard is issued, standby 
power may be addressed during the next 
cooking products rulemaking or through 
negotiation. (AHAM, No. 47 at pp. 3–4) 
AHAM also commented that the 
proposed standard’s effective date of 
2012 is inconsistent with the timing in 
the rest of the world. (AHAM, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 27) 
GE recommended that DOE should 
postpone the microwave oven standby 
power rulemaking until a robust test 
procedure is published or, in the 
alternative, issue a ‘‘no standard’’ 
standard on microwave ovens. GE 
further stated that it believes there are 
critical gaps in the engineering analysis 
used to justify the proposed standard. 
(GE, No. 48 at p. 2) GE commented that 
if the microwave oven standby and off 
mode rulemaking is not postponed, DOE 
should issue a ‘‘no standard’’ standard 
on microwave ovens. (GE, No. 48 at p. 
2) 
Whirlpool commented that it does not 
support the proposed standard. 
(Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 1) Further, 
Whirlpool stated that DOE’s rulemaking 
timeline should take into account 
international changes in microwave 
oven standards. According to 
Whirlpool, any changes in U.S. policy 
that coincided with changes in policy 
around the world would be significantly 
advantageous to manufacturers. 
(Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 29) 
Since the publication of the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE has amended the 
microwave oven test procedure for 
microwave ovens to measure standby 
mode and off mode power consumption. 
These amendments appear in the March 
2011 TP Interim Final Rule. 76 FR 
12825 (Mar. 9, 2011). The amendments 
incorporate by reference certain 
provisions of IEC Standard 62301 First 
Edition, 2005–06, which is an 
international test procedure addressing 
standby mode and off mode power 
measurement. In addition, in order to

ensure that the amended test procedure 
adequately addresses the EISA 2007 
requirement to consider the most recent 
version of IEC Standard 62301 (42 
U.S.C. 6295(gg)(2)(A)), and recognizing 
that the IEC was expected to issue IEC 
Standard 62301 (Second Edition) in the 
same timeframe as DOE was planning to 
publish the amended test procedure, 
DOE issued the microwave oven test 
procedure on an interim final basis. The 
March 2011 TP Interim Final Rule 
offered a 180-day comment period, and 
to the extent necessary, DOE is 
considering appropriate adjustments 
based on comments received. Also since 
the publication of the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE conducted further analyses 
in support of this energy conservation 
standards rulemaking, including the 
evaluation of combination microwave 
ovens. 
In considering standards for today’s 
SNOPR, DOE is proposing two product 
classes for microwave ovens: (1) 
Microwave-only ovens and countertop 
combination microwave ovens; and (2) 
built-in and over-the-range combination 
microwave ovens. DOE believes the 
analyses conducted for microwave 
ovens in the October 2008 NOPR 
remains valid for the microwave-only 
oven and countertop combination 
microwave oven product class. 
However, these analyses have been 
updated to reflect more current results, 
where applicable. DOE conducted 
additional analyses for the built-in and 
over-the-range combination microwave 
oven product class. The approach and 
results for proposed standard levels for 
today’s SNOPR are discussed in section 
IV. 
3. Manufacturer Tax Credits Impact on 
Market Adoption of More Efficient 
Products 
Whirlpool commented that the 
analysis cites dated studies which 
suggest that the consumer sees little 
economic benefit of manufacturer tax 
credits. Not covered in this analysis is 
that the tax credits provide 
manufacturers some of the cash flow 
necessary to invest in the development 
of ever more efficient products. Thus, 
the consumer sees significant benefit in 
the form of increasingly energy and 
water efficient products in the 
marketplace. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 9) 
As described in chapter 17 of the 
SNOPR TSD on the Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (RIA), DOE analyzed non- 
regulatory alternatives to minimum 
energy conservation standards, 
including manufacturer tax credits. The 
RIA assesses the national energy savings 
and economic impacts (i.e., NPV) of the 
non-regulatory alternatives relative to 
the national impacts from minimum 
energy conservation standards. In the 
case of manufacturer tax credits, DOE 
agrees that they provide manufacturers 
the financial means to develop and sell 
more efficient products and that the 
resulting consumer purchase price 
would be partially mitigated by the tax 
credits. However, DOE estimated that 
tax credits would be paid for by 
consumers in another form (such as 
additional taxes), and therefore did not 
include them as a consumer benefit for 
the purposes of calculating the national 
NPV. DOE did estimate that 
manufacturer tax credits will lead to an 
increase in the sales of more energy- 
efficient products. DOE determined, 
however, that the rate of adoption of 
more efficient products due to 
manufacturer tax credits is not as great 
as that from mandatory minimum 
energy conservation standards. For more 
details on DOE’s analysis of 
manufacturer tax credits and all non- 
regulatory alternatives, refer to chapter 
17 of the SNOPR TSD. 
V. Analytical Results 
A. Trial Standard Levels 
DOE analyzed the benefits and 
burdens of a number of TSLs for the 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use that are the subject of 
today’s proposed rule. For the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE based the TSLs on 
standby power levels explored in the 
November 2007 ANOPR, and selected 
the TSLs on consideration of economic 
factors and current market conditions. 
As discussed previously in section IV, 
given the small number of standby 
power levels analyzed, DOE maintained 
all four of the standby power levels to 
consider as TSLs. 
Table V.1 shows the TSLs for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use. In all, DOE has 
considered four TSLs. TSL 1 
corresponds to the first candidate 
standard level from each product class 
and represents the standby power level 
for each class with the least significant 
design change. TSL 4 corresponds to the 
max-tech efficiency levels. TSLs 2 and 
3 are intermediate levels between TSL 1 
and TSL 4.

B. Economic Justification and Energy 
Savings 
1. Economic Impacts on Consumers 
a. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
To evaluate the net economic impact 
of standards on consumers, DOE 
conducted LCC and PBP analyses for 
each TSL. In general, a higher-efficiency 
product would affect consumers in two 
ways: (1) Annual operating expense 
would decrease; and (2) purchase price 
would increase. Section IV.D of this 
notice discusses the inputs DOE used 
for calculating the LCC and PBP. 
The key outputs of the LCC analysis 
are a mean LCC savings relative to the 
baseline product design, as well as a 
probability distribution or likelihood of 
LCC reduction or increase, for each TSL 
and product class. The LCC analysis 
also estimates the fraction of consumers 
for which the LCC will decrease (net 
benefit), increase (net cost), or exhibit 
no change (no impact) relative to the 
base-case product forecast. No impacts 
occur when the product efficiencies of 
the base-case forecast already equal or 
exceed the efficiency at a given TSL. 
Table V.2 and Table V.3 show the 
LCC and PBP results for both microwave 
oven product classes. Note that for built- 
in and over-the-range combination

microwave ovens, 100 percent of 
consumers of such products in 2014 are 
assumed to be using a combination 
microwave oven in the base case. Any 
decrease in standby power would affect 
100 percent of the market.

b. Consumer Subgroup Analysis 
Using the LCC spreadsheet model, 
DOE determined the impact of the 
standards on the following microwave 
oven consumer subgroups: senior-only 
households and low-income 
households. Table V.4 and Table V.5 
compare the average LCC savings for 
senior-only households and low-income 
households with those for all 
households. The LCC impacts for 
senior-only and low-income households 
are essentially the same as they are for 
the general population.

c. Rebuttable-Presumption Payback 
As discussed above, EPCA establishes 
a rebuttable presumption that, in 
essence, an energy conservation 
standard is economically justified if the 
increased purchase cost for product that 
meets the standard is less than three 
times the value of the first-year energy 
savings resulting from the standard. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) DOE calculated 
a rebuttable-presumption payback 
period for each TSL to determine 
whether DOE could presume that a 
standard at that level is economically 
justified. Table V.6 shows the 
rebuttable-presumption payback periods 
for the microwave oven standby mode 
and off mode TSLs. Because only a 
single, average value is necessary for 
establishing the rebuttable-presumption 
payback period, rather than using 
distributions for input values, DOE used 
discrete values. As required by EPCA, 
DOE based the calculation on the 
assumptions in the DOE test procedures 
for microwave ovens. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) As a result, DOE

calculated a single rebuttable- 
presumption payback value, and not a 
distribution of payback periods, for each 
TSL.

With the exception of TSL 3 for built- 
in and over-the-range combination 
microwave ovens, all the TSLs in the 
above tables have rebuttable- 
presumption payback periods of less 
than 3 years. DOE believes that the 
rebuttable-presumption payback period 
criterion (i.e., a limited payback period) 
is not sufficient for determining 
economic justification. Therefore, DOE 
has considered a full range of impacts, 
including those to consumers, 
manufacturers, the Nation, and the 
environment. Section IV.D provides a 
complete discussion of how DOE 
considered the range of impacts to select 
its proposed standards. 
2. Economic Impacts on Manufacturers 
For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
used INPV to compare the financial 
impacts of different TSLs on microwave 
oven manufacturers. 73 FR 62034, 
62096–99 (Oct. 17, 2008). The INPV is 
the sum of all net cash flows discounted 
by the industry’s cost of capital 
(discount rate). DOE used the GRIM to 
compare the INPV of the base case (no 
new energy conservation standards) to 
that of each TSL for the microwave oven 
industry. To evaluate the range of cash- 
flow impacts on the microwave oven 
industry, DOE constructed different 
scenarios using different markups that 
correspond to the range of anticipated 
market responses. Each scenario results 
in a unique set of cash flows and 
corresponding industry value at each 
TSL. These steps allowed DOE to 
compare the potential impacts on the 
industry as a function of TSLs in the 
GRIM. The difference in INPV between 
the base case and the standards case is 
an estimate of the economic impacts 
that implementing that standard level 
would have on the entire industry. For 
today’s supplemental notice, DOE 
continues to use the above methodology 
and presents the results in the 
subsequent sections. See chapter 12 for 
additional information on MIA 
methodology and results. 
a. Industry Cash-Flow Analysis Results 
To assess the lower end of the range 
of potential impacts for the microwave 
oven industry, DOE considered the 
scenario reflecting the preservation of 
gross margin percentage. As production 
cost increases with efficiency, this 
scenario implies manufacturers will be 
able to maintain gross margins as a 
percentage of revenues. To assess the 
higher end of the range of potential 
impacts for the microwave oven 
industry, DOE considered the scenario 
reflecting preservation of gross margin 
in absolute dollars. Under this scenario, 
DOE assumed that the industry can 
maintain its gross margin in absolute 
dollars after the compliance date of the 
energy conservation standard. The 
industry would do so by lowering their 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue 
so that the gross margin in absolute 
dollars does not increase above the base- 
case gross margin. Table V.7 through 
Table V.12 show MIA results for 
standby mode and off mode energy 
conservation standards using both 
markup scenarios described above for 
microwave oven manufacturers.

TSL 1 represents an improvement in 
standby power from the baseline level of 
4.0 W to 2.0 W for Product Class 1 and 
an improvement in standby power from 
the baseline level of 4.5 W to 3.7 W for 
Product Class 2. At TSL 1, the impact 
on INPV and cash flow varies 
depending on the manufacturers’ ability 
to pass on increases in MPCs to their 
customers. DOE estimated the impacts 
in INPV at TSL 1 to range ¥$27.1 
million to ¥$29.3 million, or a change 
in INPV of ¥2.4 percent to ¥2.6 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow decreases by approximately 14.0 
percent, to $72.3 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $84.2 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
TSL 2 represents an improvement in 
standby power from the baseline level of 
4.0 W to 1.5 W for Product Class 1 and 
an improvement in standby power from 
the baseline level of 4.5 W to 2.7 W for 
Product Class 2. At TSL 2, the impact 
on INPV and cash flow would be similar 
to TSL 1 and depend on whether 
manufacturers can fully recover the 
increases in MPCs from their customers. 
DOE estimated the impacts in INPV at 
TSL 2 to range from ¥$45.2 million to 
¥$52.4 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥4.0 percent to ¥4.6 percent. At this 
level, the industry cash flow decreases 
by approximately 24.0 percent, to $64.0 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $84.2 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. 
TSL 3 represents an improvement in 
standby power from the baseline level of 
4.0 W to 1.0 W for Product Class 1 and 
an improvement in standby power from 
the baseline level of 4.5 W to 2.2 W for 
Product Class 2. At TSL 3, the impact 
on INPV and cash flow continues to 
vary depending on the manufacturers 
and their ability to pass on increases in 
MPCs to their customers. DOE estimated 
the impacts in INPV at TSL 3 to range 
from approximately ¥$52.9 million to 
¥73.6 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥4.7 percent to ¥6.5 percent. At this 
level, the industry cash flow decreases 
by approximately 29.9 percent, to $59.0 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $84.2 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. 
TSL 4 represents an improvement in 
standby power from the baseline level of 
4.0 W to 0.02 W for Product Class 1 and 
an improvement in standby power from 
the baseline level of 4.5 W to 0.04 W for 
Product Class 2. At TSL 4, DOE 
estimated the impacts in INPV to range 
from approximately ¥$90.4 million to 
¥$165.7 million, or a change in INPV 
of ¥8.0 percent to ¥14.7 percent. At 
this level, the industry cash flow 
decreases by approximately 57.3 
percent, to $35.9 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $84.2 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. At 
higher TSLs, manufacturers have a 
harder time fully passing on larger 
increases in MPCs to their customers. At 
TSL 4, the conversion costs are higher 
than the other TSLs because the design 
of all microwave platforms must be 
more significantly altered. 
For new standby mode and off mode 
energy conservation standards, 
conversion costs increase at higher TSLs 
as the complexity of further lowering 
standby power increases, substantially 
driving up engineering time and also 
increasing the testing and product 
development time. If the increased 
production costs are fully passed on to 
consumers (the preservation of gross 
margin percentage scenario), the 
operating revenue from higher prices is 
still not enough to overcome the 
negative impacts from the substantial 
conversion costs. The incremental costs 
are small for each TSL, meaning the 
positive impact on cash flows is small 
compared to the conversion costs 
required to achieve these efficiencies. 
As a result of the small incremental 
costs and large conversion expenses, 
INPV is negative for all TSLs under the 
preservation of gross margin percentage 
scenario. If the incremental costs are not 
fully passed along to customers (the 
preservation of gross margin (absolute 
dollars) scenario), the negative impacts 
on INPV are amplified at each TSL. 
b. Employment Impacts 
DOE discussed the domestic 
employment impacts on the microwave 
oven industry in the October NOPR. 
DOE concluded that since more than 95 
percent of microwave ovens are already 
imported and the employment impacts 
in the GRIM are small, the actual 
impacts on domestic employment 
would depend on whether any U.S. 
manufacturer decided to shift remaining 
U.S. production to lower-cost countries. 
73 FR 62034, 62101–02 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
c. Impacts on Manufacturing Capacity 
As stated in the NOPR, minor tooling 
changes would be necessary at all TSLs 
for standby mode and off mode 
standards. For all standby power levels, 
the most significant conversion costs are 
the research and development, testing, 
and certification of products with more- 
efficient components, which does not 
affect production line capacity. Thus, 
DOE believes manufacturers will be able 
to maintain manufacturing capacity 
levels and continue to meet market 
demand under new energy conservation 
standards. 73 FR 62034, 62103 (Oct. 17, 
2008). 
d. Impacts on Subgroups of 
Manufacturers 
DOE used the results of the industry 
characterization to group manufacturers 
exhibiting similar characteristics. 
However, DOE did not identify any 
manufacturer subgroups for microwave 
ovens that would justify a separate 
manufacturer subgroup. 
e. Cumulative Regulatory Burden 
During previous stages of this 
rulemaking DOE identified a number of 
requirements with which manufacturers 
of these microwave ovens must comply 
and which take effect within 3 years of 
the anticipated compliance date of the 
proposed new standards. DOE discusses 
these and other requirements, and 
includes the full details of the 
cumulative regulatory burden, in 
chapter 12 of the SNOPR TSD. 
3. National Impact Analysis 
a. Significance of Energy Savings 
To estimate the energy savings 
through 2043 attributable to potential 
standards for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode, DOE compared the 
energy consumption of those products 
under the base case to their energy 
consumption under each TSL. Table 
V.13 presents the forecasted NES for 
each TSL for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode. The savings were 
calculated using the approach described 
in section IV.E.

Chapter 10 of the SNOPR TSD 
provides additional details on the NES 
values reported in Table V.13, and also 
presents tables that show the magnitude 
of the energy savings discounted at rates 
of 3 percent and 7 percent. Discounted 
energy savings represent a policy 
perspective in which energy savings 
realized farther in the future are less 
significant than energy savings realized 
in the nearer term. 
b. Net Present Value of Consumer Costs 
and Benefits 
DOE estimated the cumulative NPV to 
the Nation of the total costs and savings 
for consumers that would result from 
particular standard levels for microwave 
oven standby mode and off mode. In 
accordance with the OMB’s guidelines 
on regulatory analysis,28 DOE calculated 
NPV using both a 7-percent and a 3- 
percent real discount rate. The 7-percent 
rate is an estimate of the average before- 
tax rate of return on private capital in 
the U.S. economy, and reflects the 
returns on real estate and small business 
capital as well as corporate capital. DOE 
used this discount rate to approximate 
the opportunity cost of capital in the 
private sector, because recent OMB 
analysis has found the average rate of 
return on capital to be near this rate. 
DOE used the 3-percent rate to capture 
the potential effects of standards on 
private consumption (e.g., through 
higher prices for products and reduced 
purchases of energy). This rate 
represents the rate at which society 
discounts future consumption flows to 
their present value. This rate can be 
approximated by the real rate of return 
on long-term government debt (i.e., 
yield on Treasury notes minus annual 
rate of change in the Consumer Price 
Index), which has averaged about 3 
percent on a pre-tax basis for the past 30 
years. 
Table V.14 shows the consumer NPV 
results for each TSL DOE considered for 
both product classes of microwave 
ovens, using both a 7-percent and a 3- 
percent discount rate. In each case, the 
impacts, i.e., discounted operating cost 
savings and discounted incremental 
equipment costs, cover the lifetime of 
products purchased in 2014–2043. For 
Product Class 1 (microwave-only and 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens), the benefit-to-cost ratio is greater 
than or equal to nine for TSLs 1, 2, and 
3 and greater than three for TSL 4, 
irrespective of discount rate. For 
Product Class 2 (built-in and over-the- 
range combination microwave ovens), 
TSLs 2 and 4 have benefit-to-cost ratios 
of approximately five, irrespective of 
discount rate, while TSL 1, which 
incurs no additional cost relative to the 
baseline, has a limitless benefit-to-cost 
ratio. At TSL3, the benefits are 30 
percent and 50 percent greater than the 
costs at discount rates of 7-percent and 
3-percent, respectively. See chapter 10 
of the SNOPR TSD for more detailed 
NPV results.

The NPV results presented in Table 
V.14 are based on a learning rate of 28.9 
percent, which is referred to as the 
‘‘default’’ learning rate. DOE 
investigated the impact of different 
learning rates for product prices for the 
TSLs considered for microwave oven 
standby mode and off mode. DOE 
considered four learning rate 
sensitivities: (1) A ‘‘high learning’’ rate 
(37.0 percent); (2) a ‘‘low learning’’ rate 
(19.2 percent); (3) a ‘‘no learning’’ rate

(constant real prices); and (4) a 
‘‘microwave oven only’’ rate. The 
‘‘microwave oven only’’ is based on 
limited set of historical price data 
specifically for microwave ovens. DOE 
also analyzed a sensitivity based on the 
‘‘chained price index—other consumer 
durable goods except ophthalmic’’ that 
was forecasted for use in AEO2010. This 
index is the most disaggregated category 
that includes appliances. Refer to 
appendix 8–E of the SNOPR TSD for 
details on the development of the above 
learning sensitivities. 
Table V.15 provides the annualized 
NPV of consumer benefits at a 3-percent 
discount rate, combined with the 
annualized present value of monetized 
benefits from CO2 and NOX emissions 
reductions, for each of the TSLs for the 
‘‘default’’ learning rate and the 
sensitivity cases. Table V.16 provides 
the annualized NPVs using a 7-percent 
discount rate for consumer NPV. 
Section V.B.6 provides a complete 
description and summary of the 
monetized benefits from CO2 and NOX 
emissions reductions. For most of the 
TSLs, the difference between the default 
results and the sensitivities is 
insignificant.

* The economic benefits from reduced CO2 emissions were calculated using a SCC value of $22.3/metric ton in 2010 (in 2010$) for CO2, in-
creasing at 3% per year, and a discount rate of 3%. The economic benefits from reduced NOX emissions were calculated using a value of $2,537/ton (in 2010$), which is the average of the low and high values used in DOE’s analysis, and a 3-percent discount rate. Because the dis-
counted equipment cost increases at each TSL are very small relative to the discounted operating cost savings and the discounted monetized 
benefits of the emission reductions, the NPV as a function of learning rate does not change appreciably. In fact, the learning rate has a signifi-
cant effect only on the NPV for TSL 4 where discounted equipment cost increases are relatively more significant.

c. Indirect Impacts on Employment 
DOE develops estimates of the 
indirect employment impacts of 
proposed standards on the economy in 
general. As discussed above, DOE 
expects energy conservation standards 
for microwave ovens to reduce energy 
bills for consumers of those products, 
and the resulting net savings to be 
redirected to other forms of economic 
activity. Those shifts in spending and 
economic activity could affect the 
demand for labor. As described in 
section IV.H, to estimate those effects, 
DOE used an input/output model of the 
U.S. economy. DOE estimated the 
indirect employment impacts for the 
TSLs for both product classes of 
microwave ovens that DOE considered 
in this rulemaking. DOE understands 
that there are uncertainties involved in 
projecting employment impacts, 
especially changes in the later years of 
the analysis. Therefore, DOE generated 
results for intermediate timeframes, 
such as 2015, where these uncertainties 
are reduced. 
The results suggest the proposed 
standards are likely to have negligible 
impact on the net demand for labor in 
the economy. The net change in jobs is 
so small that it would be imperceptible 
in national labor statistics and might be 
offset by other, unanticipated effects on 
employment. Chapter 13 of the SNOPR 
TSD presents the detailed results.

4. Impact on Utility or Performance of 
Product 
For the reasons stated in section 
III.D.1.d, DOE believes that for purposes 
of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV), the 
standby power level considered in this 
supplemental notice does not reduce the 
utility or performance of the microwave 
oven products under consideration in 
this rulemaking. 
5. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 
In weighing the promulgation of any 
proposed standards, DOE is required to 
consider any lessening of competition 
that is likely to result from the adoption 
of those standards. The determination of 
the likely competitive impacts 
stemming from a proposed standard is 
made by the Attorney General, who 
transmits this determination, along with 
an analysis of the nature and extent of 
the impact, to the Secretary of Energy. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 
(B)(ii)) 
The Attorney General’s determination 
for the October 2008 NOPR included 
cooking products but did not mention 
microwave oven standards. (DOJ, No. 53 
at pp. 1–2). To assist the Attorney 
General in making such a determination 
for the proposed standby mode and off 
mode standards, DOE has provided the 
Attorney General with copies of this 
notice and the TSD for review. DOE will 
consider the Attorney General’s opinion 
on the proposed rule in preparing the 
final rule. 
6. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 
Improving the energy consumption of 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode, where economically justified, 
would likely improve the security of the 
Nation’s energy system by reducing 
overall demand for energy. Reduced 
electricity demand may also improve 
the reliability of the electricity system. 
As a measure of this reduced demand, 
Table V.17 presents the estimated 
reduction in national generating 
capacity for the TSLs that DOE 
considered in this rulemaking.

TIONAL INSTALLED ELECTRICITY

Energy savings from more stringent 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode standards would also produce 
environmental benefits in the form of 
reduced emissions of air pollutants and 
greenhouse gases associated with 
electricity production. Table V.18 
provides DOE’s estimate of cumulative 
CO2 and NOX emissions reductions that 
would result from the TSLs considered 
in this rulemaking. (Hg emission 
impacts are negligible and therefore not 
reported here.) In the environmental 
assessment (chapter 15 of the SNOPR 
TSD), DOE reports estimated annual 
changes in CO2, NOX, and Hg emissions 
attributable to each TSL.

NOX (1,000 tons) ............................................................................................................. 12.88 18.61 25.60 39.42 
Mt = million metric tons. Values for NOX emissions reductions refer to short tons. 
As discussed in section IV.J of this 
supplemental notice, DOE has not 
reported SO2 emissions reductions from 
power plants because there is 
uncertainty about the effect of energy 
conservation standards on the overall 
level of SO2 emissions in the United 
States due to SO2 emissions caps. DOE 
also did not include NOX emissions 
reduction from power plants in States 
subject to CAIR because an energy 
conservation standard would not affect 
the overall level of NOX emissions in 
those States due to the emissions caps 
mandated by CAIR. 
DOE also estimated monetary benefits 
likely to result from the reduced 
emissions of CO2 and NOX that DOE 
estimated for each of the TSLs 
considered for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode. In order to make 
this calculation similar to the 
calculation of the NPV of consumer 
benefit, DOE considered the reduced 
emissions expected to result over the 
lifetime of products shipped in 2014– 
2043. Thus, the emissions reductions 
extend past 2043. 
As discussed in section IV.K, DOE 
used values for the SCC developed by 
an interagency process. The four values 
for CO2 emissions reductions resulting 
from that process (expressed in 2010$) 
are $4.9/ton (the average value from a 
distribution that uses a 5-percent 
discount rate), $22.3/ton (the average 
value from a distribution that uses a 3- 
percent discount rate), $36.5/ton (the 
average value from a distribution that 
uses a 2.5-percent discount rate), and 
$67.6/ton (the 95th-percentile value 
from a distribution that uses a 3-percent 
discount rate). These values correspond 
to the value of emission reductions in 
2010; the values for later years are 
higher due to increasing damages as the 
magnitude of climate change increases. 
For each of the four cases, DOE 
calculated a present value of the stream 
of annual values using the same 
discount rate as was used in the studies 
upon which the dollar-per-ton values 
are based. Table V.19 presents the global 
values of CO2 emissions reductions at 
each TSL. DOE calculated domestic 
values as a range from 7 percent to 23 
percent of the global values, and these 
results are presented in chapter 16 of 
the SNOPR TSD.

DOE is well aware that scientific and 
economic knowledge about the 
contribution of CO2 and other GHG 
emissions to changes in the future 
global climate and the potential 
resulting damages to the world economy 
continues to evolve rapidly. Thus, any 
value placed in this rulemaking on 
reducing CO2 emissions is subject to 
change. DOE, together with other 
Federal agencies, will continue to 
review various methodologies for 
estimating the monetary value of 
reductions in CO2 and other GHG 
emissions. This ongoing review will 
consider the comments on this subject 
that are part of the public record for this 
and other rulemakings, as well as other 
methodological assumptions and issues. 
However, consistent with DOE’s legal 
obligations, and taking into account the 
uncertainty involved with this 
particular issue, DOE has included in 
this proposed rule the most recent 
values resulting from the ongoing 
interagency review process. 
DOE also estimated a range for the 
cumulative monetary value of the 
economic benefits associated with NOX 
emissions reductions anticipated to 
result from new standby mode and off 
mode standards for microwave ovens. 
The dollar-per-ton values that DOE used 
are discussed in section IV.K. Table 
V.20 presents the cumulative present 
values for each TSL calculated using 7- 
percent and 3-percent discount rates.

The NPV of the monetized benefits 
associated with emissions reductions 
can be viewed as a complement to the 
NPV of the consumer savings calculated 
for each TSL considered in this 
rulemaking. Table V.21 and Table V.22 
presents the NPV values that result from 
adding the estimates of the potential 
economic benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 and NOX emissions in each 
of four valuation scenarios to the NPV 
of consumer savings calculated for each 
TSL considered in this rulemaking, at 
both a 7-percent and 3-percent discount 
rate. The CO2 values used in the 
columns of each table correspond to the 
four scenarios for the valuation of CO2 
emission reductions presented in 
section IV.K.

Although adding the value of 
consumer savings to the values of 
emission reductions provides a valuable 
perspective, two issues should be 
considered. First, the national operating 
cost savings are domestic U.S. consumer 
monetary savings that occur as a result 
of market transactions, while the value 
of CO2 reductions is based on a global 
value. Second, the assessments of 
operating cost savings and the SCC are 
performed with different methods that 
use quite different time frames for 
analysis. The national operating cost 
savings is measured for the lifetime of 
products shipped in 2014–2043. The 
SCC values, on the other hand, reflect 
the present value of future climate- 
related impacts resulting from the 
emission of one ton of CO2 in each year. 
These impacts continue well beyond 
2100. 
7. Other Factors 
The Secretary of Energy, in 
determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, may consider 
any other factors that the Secretary 
deems to be relevant. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI))) DOE has not 
considered other factors in development 
of the proposed standards in this 
SNOPR. 
C. Proposed Standard 
When considering proposed 
standards, the new or amended energy 
conservation standard that DOE adopts 
for any type (or class) of covered 
product shall be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that the Secretary determines 
is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A)) In determining whether a 
standard is economically justified, the 
Secretary must determine whether the 
benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens to the greatest extent 
practicable, in light of the seven 
statutory factors discussed previously. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) The new or 
amended standard must also ‘‘result in 
significant conservation of energy.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE considered 
the impacts of standards at each TSL, 
beginning with the maximum 
technologically feasible level, to 
determine whether that level was 
economically justified. Where the max- 
tech level was not justified, DOE then 
considered the next most efficient level 
and undertook the same evaluation until 
it reached the highest efficiency level 
that is both technologically feasible and 
economically justified and saves a 
significant amount of energy. 
To aid the reader in understanding 
the benefits and/or burdens of each TSL, 
Table V.24 summarizes the quantitative 
analytical results for each TSL, based on 
the assumptions and methodology 
discussed herein. In addition to the 
quantitative results presented in the 
table, DOE also considers other burdens 
and benefits that affect economic 
justification. These include the impacts 
on identifiable subgroups of consumers, 
such as low-income households and 
seniors, who may be disproportionately 
affected by a national standard. Section 
V.B.1 presents the estimated impacts of 
each TSL for these subgroups. 
In addition to the quantitative results, 
DOE also considered harmonization of 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode standards with international 
standby power programs such as Korea’s 
e-standby program,29 Australia’s 
standby program,30 and Japan’s Top 
Runner Program.31 Those programs seek 
to establish standby power ratings 
through the International Energy 
Agency’s (IEA) 1-Watt Program, which 
seeks to lower standby power below 1 
W for microwave ovens.32 Korea 
published a mandatory standby power 
standard of 1 W that became effective in 
2010 and Australia will publish 
mandatory standby power standards of 
1 W by 2012. In accordance with Japan’s 
Top Runner Program, Japanese 
appliance manufacturers made a 
voluntary declaration to reduce standby 
power of microwave ovens that lack a 
timer to as close to zero as possible and 
that of microwave ovens that have a 
timer to 1 W or lower. 
DOE also notes that the economics 
literature provides a wide-ranging 
discussion of how consumers trade off 
upfront costs and energy savings in the 
absence of government intervention. 
Much of this literature attempts to 
explain why consumers appear to 
undervalue energy efficiency 
improvements. This undervaluation 
suggests that regulation that promotes 
energy efficiency can produce 
significant net private gains (as well as 
producing social gains by, for example, 
reducing pollution). There is evidence 
that consumers undervalue future

energy savings as a result of (1) a lack 
of information; (2) a lack of sufficient 
salience of the long-term or aggregate 
benefits; (3) a lack of sufficient savings 
to warrant delaying or altering 
purchases (for example, an inefficient 
ventilation fan in a new building or the 
delayed replacement of a water pump); 
(4) excessive focus on the short term, in 
the form of inconsistent weighting of 
future energy cost savings relative to 
available returns on other investments; 
(5) computational or other difficulties 
associated with the evaluation of 
relevant tradeoffs; and (6) a divergence 
in incentives (that is, renter versus 
owner; builder vs. purchaser). Other 
literature indicates that with less than 
perfect foresight and a high degree of 
uncertainty about the future, consumers 
may trade off these types of investments 
at a higher than expected rate between 
current consumption and uncertain 
future energy cost savings. 
In its current regulatory analysis, 
potential changes in the benefits and 
costs of a regulation due to changes in 
consumer purchase decisions are 
included in two ways: (1) If consumers 
forego a purchase of a product in the 
standards case, this decreases sales for 
product manufacturers and the cost to 
manufacturers is included in the MIA, 
and (2) DOE accounts for energy savings 
attributable only to products actually 
used by consumers in the standards 
case; if a regulatory option decreases the 
number of products used by consumers, 
this decreases the potential energy 
savings from an energy conservation 
standard. DOE provides detailed 
estimates of shipments and changes in 
the volume of product purchases in 
chapter 9 of the SNOPR TSD. 
While DOE is not prepared at present 
to provide a fuller quantifiable 
framework for estimating the benefits 
and costs of changes in consumer 
purchase decisions due to an energy 
conservation standard, DOE seeks 
comments on how to more fully assess 
the potential impact of energy 
conservation standards on consumer 
choice and how to quantify this impact 
in its regulatory analysis in future 
rulemakings.

Parentheses indicate negative (¥) values. For NPVs, a negative value means a decrease in NPV. 
* Range of the economic value of CO2 reductions is based on estimates of the global benefit of reduced CO2 emissions. 
First, DOE considered TSL 4, the max- 
tech level for microwave oven standby 
mode and off mode energy use. TSL 4 
likely would save 0.63 quads of energy 
through 2043, an amount DOE considers 
significant. Under TSL 4, the estimated 
NPV of consumer benefit is $2.25 
billion, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and $4.60 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 4 are 48.46 Mt of CO2 and 39.42 
thousand tons of NOX, with a negligible 
impact on Hg emissions. The estimated 
monetary value of the CO2 emissions 
reductions at TSL 4 ranges from $213 
million to $3,259 million. Total 
generating capacity in 2043 is estimated 
to decrease by 0.601 GW. 
DOE projects that at TSL 4 for 
microwave-only ovens and countertop 
combination microwave ovens (Product 
Class 1), the average microwave oven

33 DOE used a two-step calculation process to 
convert the time-series of costs and benefits into 
annualized values. First, DOE calculated a present 
value in 2011, the year used for discounting the 
NPV of total consumer costs and savings, for the 
time-series of costs and benefits using discount 
rates of 3 and 7 percent for all costs and benefits 
except for the value of CO2 reductions. For the 
latter, DOE used a range of discount rates, as shown 
in Table V.26. From the present value, DOE then 
calculated the fixed annual payment over a 30-year 
period, starting in 2011, that yields the same 
present value. The fixed annual payment is the 
annualized value. Although DOE calculated 
annualized values, this does not imply that the 
time-series of cost and benefits from which the 
annualized values were determined would be a 
steady stream of payments. 
microwave ovens would realize some 
LCC savings. The median payback 
period at TSL 4 is projected to be 2.4 
years, substantially shorter than the 
lifetime of the product. DOE projects 
that at TSL 4 for built-in and over-the- 
range combination microwave ovens 
(Product Class 2), the average 
microwave oven consumer would 
experience a decrease in LCC of $27, 
and all consumers who purchase these 
microwave ovens would realize some 
LCC savings. The median payback 
period at TSL 4 is projected to be 1.8 
years, substantially shorter than the 
lifetime of the product. 
Although DOE estimates that all 
microwave oven consumers would 
benefit economically from TSL 4, the 
reduction in standby power 
consumption at TSL 4 would result in 
the loss of certain functions that provide 
utility to consumers, specifically the 
continuous clock display. Because it is 
uncertain how greatly consumers value 
this function, DOE is concerned that 
TSL 4 may result in significant loss of 
consumer utility. 
For manufacturers of microwave 
ovens, DOE estimated a decrease in 
INPV that ranges from $90.4 million to 
$165.7 million. DOE recognizes that 
TSL 4 poses the risk of large negative 
impacts if manufacturers’ expectations 
about reduced profit margins are 
realized. In particular, if the high end of 
the range of impacts is reached, as DOE 
expects, TSL 4 could result in a net loss 
of 14.7 percent in INPV to microwave 
oven manufacturers. 
After carefully considering the 
analysis and weighing the benefits and 
burdens of TSL 4, the Secretary has 
reached the following initial conclusion: 
At TSL 4, the benefits of energy savings, 
NPV of consumer benefit, positive 
consumer LCC impacts, and emissions 
reductions would be outweighed by the 
potential burden on consumers from 
loss of product utility and the large 
capital conversion costs that could 
result in a reduction in INPV for 
manufacturers. 
DOE then considered TSL 3. Primary 
energy savings are estimated to be 0.41 
quads of energy through 2043, which 
DOE considers significant. Under TSL 3, 
the estimated NPV of consumer benefit 
is $1.82 billion, using a discount rate of 
7 percent, and $3.59 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 3 are 31.48 Mt of CO2 and 25.60 
thousand tons of NOX, with a negligible 
impact on Hg emissions. The estimated 
monetary value of the CO2 emissions 
reductions at TSL 3 ranges from $139 
million to $2,118 million. Total 
generating capacity in 2043 under TSL 
3 is estimated to decrease by 0.390 GW. 
For microwave-only ovens and 
countertop combination microwave 
ovens, DOE projects that at TSL 3 the 
average consumer would experience a 
decrease in LCC of $13, and all 
consumers who purchase these 
microwave ovens would realize some 
LCC savings. At TSL 3 the median 
payback period is projected to be 1.1 
years, substantially shorter than the 
lifetime of the product. In addition, DOE 
estimates that the reduction in standby 
power consumption under TSL 3 (to no 
greater than 1.0 W) would not impact 
consumer utility. The continuous clock 
display that would be lost under TSL 4 
would be retained at TSL 3. 
For built-in and combination 
microwave ovens, DOE projects that at 
TSL 3 the average consumer would 
experience a decrease in LCC of $4, and 
79 percent of consumers who purchase 
these microwave ovens would realize 
some LCC savings. At TSL 3 the median 
payback period is projected to be 6.3 
years, shorter than the lifetime of the 
product. 
For manufacturers of microwave 
ovens, DOE estimated that the projected 
decrease in INPV under TSL 3 would 
range from $52.9 million to $73.6 
million. DOE recognizes the risk of large 
negative impacts at TSL 3 if 
manufacturers’ expectations about 
reduced profit margins are realized. In 
particular, if the high end of the range 
of impacts is reached, as DOE expects, 
TSL 3 could result in a net loss of 6.5 
percent in INPV to microwave oven 
manufacturers. 
After considering the analysis and 
weighing the benefits and the burdens, 
DOE has tentatively concluded that the 
benefits of energy savings, NPV of 
consumer benefit, positive consumer 
LCC impacts, and emissions reductions 
would outweigh the capital conversion 
costs that could result in a reduction in 
INPV for manufacturers. In particular, 
the Secretary has concluded that TSL 3 
would save a significant amount of 
energy and is technologically feasible 
and economically justified. Therefore, 
DOE today proposes to adopt the energy 
conservation standards for microwave 
oven standby mode and off mode at TSL 
3. Table V.23 presents the proposed 
standby mode and off mode energy 
conservation standards for microwave 
ovens. 
TABLE V.23—PROPOSED ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS FOR MICROWAVE OVEN STANDBY AND OFF MODE 
Product classes Proposed energy conservation standard 
Microwave-Only Ovens and Countertop Combination Microwave Ovens Maximum Standby Power = 1.0 watt. 
Built-In and Over-the-Range Combination Microwave Ovens ................. Maximum Standby Power = 2.2 watts. 
2. Summary of Benefits and Costs 
(Annualized) of the Proposed Standards 
The benefits and costs of today’s 
proposed standards can also be 
expressed in terms of annualized values. 
The annualized monetary values are the 
sum of (1) the annualized national 
economic value, expressed in 2010$, of 
the benefits from operating products 
that meet the proposed standards 
(consisting primarily of operating cost 
savings from using less energy, minus 
increases in equipment purchase costs, 
which is another way of representing 
consumer NPV), and (2) the monetary 
value of the benefits of emission 
reductions, including CO2 emission 
reductions.33 The value of the CO2 
reductions is calculated using a range of 
values per metric ton of CO2 developed 
by a recent interagency process. The 
monetary costs and benefits of 
cumulative emissions reductions are 
reported in 2010$ to permit 
comparisons with the other costs and 
benefits in the same dollar units. 
Although combining the values of 
operating savings and CO2 reductions 
provides a useful perspective, two 
issues should be considered. First, the 
national operating savings are domestic

U.S. consumer monetary savings that 
occur as a result of market transactions 
while the value of CO2 reductions is 
based on a global value. Second, the 
assessments of operating cost savings 
and SCC are performed with different 
methods that use different time frames 
for analysis. The national operating cost 
savings is measured for the lifetime of 
products shipped in 2014–2043. The 
SCC values, on the other hand, reflect 
the present value of future climate- 
related impacts resulting from the 
emission of one ton of CO2 in each year. 
These impacts continue well beyond 
2100. 
Table V.24 shows the annualized 
values for the proposed standards for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode energy use. The results for the 
primary estimate are as follows. Using a 
7-percent discount rate for benefits and 
costs other than CO2 reductions, for 
which DOE used a 3-percent discount 
rate along with the SCC series 
corresponding to a value of $22.3/ton in 
2010, the cost of the standards proposed 
in today’s rule is $20.3 million per year 
in increased product costs, while the 
annualized benefits are $167 million in 
reduced product operating costs, $35.4 
million in CO2 reductions, and $1.74 
million in reduced NOX emissions. In 
this case, the net benefit amounts to 
$184 million per year. Using a 3-percent 
discount rate for all benefits and costs 
and the SCC series corresponding to a 
value of $22.3/ton in 2010, the cost of 
the standards proposed in today’s rule 
is $21.6 million per year in increased 
product costs, while the annualized 
benefits are $205 million in reduced 
operating costs, $35.4 million in CO2 
reductions, and $2.14 million in 
reduced NOX emissions. In this case, the 
net benefit amounts to $221 million per 
year.

* The Primary, Benefits, and High Benefits Estimates utilize forecasts of energy prices and housing starts from the AEO 2010 Reference case, 
Low Economic Growth case, and High Economic Growth case, respectively. In addition, the Low estimate uses incremental product costs that re-
flects constant prices (no learning rate) for product prices, and the High estimate uses incremental product costs that reflects a declining trend 
(high learning rate) for product prices. 
** The CO2 values represent global values (in 2010$) of the social cost of CO2 emissions in 2010 under several scenarios. The values of $4.9, $22.3, and $36.5 per ton are the averages of SCC distributions calculated using 5%, 3%, and 2.5% discount rates, respectively. The value of 
$67.6 per ton represents the 95th percentile of the SCC distribution calculated using a 3% discount rate. The value for NOX (in 2010$) is the av-
erage of the low and high values used in DOE’s analysis. 
† Total Benefits for both the 3% and 7% cases are derived using the SCC value calculated at a 3% discount rate, which is $22.3/ton in 2010 
(in 2010$). In the rows labeled as ‘‘7% plus CO2 range’’ and ‘‘3% plus CO2 range,’’ the operating cost and NOX benefits are calculated using the 
labeled discount rate, and those values are added to the full range of CO2 values. 
VI. Additional Technical Corrections to 
10 CFR 430.32 
In today’s SNOPR, DOE is also 
proposing the following technical 
corrections to the language contained in 
10 CFR 430.32. DOE notes that the title 
of 10 CFR 430.32, ‘‘Energy and water 
conservation standards and their 
effective dates’’ contains dates required 
for compliance with energy and water 
conservation standards rather than the 
effective dates of such standards. As a 
result, DOE is proposing to revise the 
title of 10 CFR 430.32 to read ‘‘Energy 
and water conservation standards and 
their compliance dates.’’ DOE also notes 
that the current energy conservation 
standards for cooking products found at 
10 CFR 430.32(j)(1)–(2) should be 
revised to more accurately reflect the 
date required for compliance with 
energy conservation standards. DOE is 
proposing to revise the language in 10 
CFR 430.32(j)(1)–(2) to state that 
products manufactured on or after the 
compliance date must meet the required 
energy conservation standard.

VII. Procedural Issues and Regulatory 
Review 
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 
and 13563 
Section 1(b)(1) of Executive Order 
12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and 
Review,’’ 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), 
requires each agency to identify the 
problem that it intends to address, 
including, where applicable, the failures 
of private markets or public institutions 
that warrant new agency action, as well 
as to assess the significance of that 
problem. The problems that today’s 
proposed standards address are as 
follows: 
(1) There is a lack of consumer 
information and/or information 
processing capability about energy 
efficiency opportunities in the home 
appliance market. 
(2) There is asymmetric information 
(one party to a transaction has more and 
better information than the other) and/ 
or high transactions costs (costs of 
gathering information and effecting 
exchanges of goods and services). 
(3) There are external benefits 
resulting from improved energy 
efficiency of microwave ovens that are 
not captured by the users of such 
equipment. These benefits include 
externalities related to environmental 
protection and energy security that are 
not reflected in energy prices, such as 
reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. 
In addition, DOE has determined that 
today’s regulatory action is an 
‘‘economically significant regulatory 
action’’ under section 3(f)(1) of 
Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, 
section 6(a)(3) of the Executive Order 
requires that DOE prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis (RIA) on today’s rule 
and that OIRA review this rule. DOE 
presented to OIRA for review the draft 
rule and other documents prepared for 
this rulemaking, including the RIA, and 
has included these documents in the 
rulemaking record. The assessments 
prepared pursuant to Executive Order 
12866 can be found in the TSD for this 
rulemaking, available at 
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliance_standards/residential/ 
cooking_products.html. 
DOE has also reviewed this regulation 
pursuant to Executive Order 13563, 
issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3281, 
Jan. 21, 2011). Executive Order 13563 is 
supplemental to and explicitly reaffirms 
the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing regulatory review 
established in Executive Order 12866. 
To the extent permitted by law, agencies 
are required by Executive Order 13563 
to: (1) Propose or adopt a regulation 
only upon a reasoned determination 
that its benefits justify its costs 
(recognizing that some benefits and 
costs are difficult to quantify); (2) tailor 
regulations to impose the least burden 
on society, consistent with obtaining 
regulatory objectives, taking into 
account, among other things, and to the 
extent practicable, the costs of 
cumulative regulations; (3) select, in 
choosing among alternative regulatory 
approaches, those approaches that 
maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, 
public health and safety, and other 
advantages; distributive impacts; and 
equity); (4) to the extent feasible, specify 
performance objectives, rather than 
specifying the behavior or manner of 
compliance that regulated entities must 
adopt; and (5) identify and assess 
available alternatives to direct 
regulation, including providing 
economic incentives to encourage the 
desired behavior, such as user fees or 
marketable permits, or providing 
information upon which choices can be 
made by the public. 
DOE emphasizes as well that 
Executive Order 13563 requires agencies 
‘‘to use the best available techniques to 
quantify anticipated present and future 
benefits and costs as accurately as 
possible.’’ In its guidance, OIRA has 
emphasized that such techniques may 
include ‘‘identifying changing future 
compliance costs that might result from 
technological innovation or anticipated 
behavioral changes.’’ For the reasons 
stated in the preamble, DOE believes 
that today’s SNOPR is consistent with 
these principles, including the 
requirement that, to the extent 
permitted by law, benefits justify costs 
and that net benefits are maximized. 
B. Review Under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires preparation 
of an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis (IRFA) for any rule that by law 
must be proposed for public comment, 
unless the agency certifies that the rule, 
if promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. As 
required by Executive Order 13272, 
‘‘Proper Consideration of Small Entities 
in Agency Rulemaking,’’ 67 FR 53461 
(Aug. 16, 2002), DOE published 
procedures and policies on February 19, 
2003, to ensure that the potential 
impacts of its rules on small entities are 
properly considered during the 
rulemaking process. 68 FR 7990 DOE 
has made its procedures and policies 
available on the Office of the General 
Counsel’s Web site (www.gc.doe.gov). 
For manufacturers of microwave 
ovens, the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) has set a size 
threshold, which defines those entities 
classified as ‘‘small businesses’’ for the 
purposes of the statute. DOE used the 
SBA’s small business size standards to 
determine whether any small entities 
would be subject to the requirements of 
the rule. 65 FR 30836, 30850 (May 15, 
2000), as amended at 65 FR 53533, 
53545 (Sept. 5, 2000) and codified at 13 
CFR part 121. The size standards are 
listed by North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) code and 
industry description and are available at 
http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small- 
business-size-standards. DOE used the 
size standards the SBA published on 
November 5, 2010, as amended, to 
determine whether any small entities 
would be required to comply with the 
rule. Microwave oven manufacturing is 
classified under NAICS 335221, 
‘‘Manufacturers of Household Cooking 
Appliances.’’ The SBA sets a threshold 
of 750 employees or less for an entity to 
be considered as a small business for 
this category. 
The microwave oven industry 
consists of seven manufacturers that 
have a market share greater than 3 
percent. Most are large, foreign 
companies that import microwave ovens 
into the United States. There are U.S. 
facilities that partly assemble 
microwave ovens. However, no 
domestic facilities are small businesses. 
Furthermore none of the microwave 
oven manufacturers are small business 
manufacturers. Thus, DOE did not 
conduct an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis. 
C. Review Under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act 
Manufacturers of microwave ovens 
must certify to DOE that their product 
complies with any applicable energy 
conservation standard. In certifying 
compliance, manufacturers must test 
their product according to the DOE test 
procedure for microwave ovens, 
including any amendments adopted for 
that test procedure. DOE has established 
regulations for the certification and 
recordkeeping requirements for all 
covered consumer products and 
commercial equipment, including 
microwave ovens. 75 FR 56796 (Sept. 
16, 2010). The collection-of-information 
requirement for the certification and 
recordkeeping is subject to review and 
approval by OMB under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (PRA). This requirement 
has been approved by OMB under OMB 
control number 1910–1400. Public 
reporting burden for the certification is 
estimated to average 20 hours per

response, including the time for 
reviewing instructions, searching 
existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and 
completing and reviewing the collection 
of information. 
Notwithstanding any other provision 
of the law, no person is required to 
respond to, nor shall any person be 
subject to a penalty for failure to comply 
with, a collection of information subject 
to the requirements of the PRA, unless 
that collection of information displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number. 
D. Review Under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
Pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), DOE has determined that the 
proposed rule fits within the category of 
actions included in Categorical 
Exclusion (CX) B5.1 and otherwise 
meets the requirements for application 
of a CX. (See 10 CFR 1021.410(b) and 
Appendix B to Subpart D) The proposed 
rule fits within this category of actions 
because it is a rulemaking that 
establishes energy conservation 
standards for consumer products or 
industrial equipment, and for which 
none of the exceptions identified in CX 
B5.1(b) apply. Therefore, DOE has made 
a CX determination for this rulemaking, 
and DOE does not need to prepare an 
Environmental Assessment or 
Environmental Impact Statement for 
this proposed rule. DOE’s CX 
determination for this proposed rule is 
available at http://cxnepa.energy.gov. 
E. Review Under Executive Order 13132 
Executive Order 13132, ‘‘Federalism,’’ 
64 FR 43255 (Aug. 10, 1999) imposes 
certain requirements on Federal 
agencies formulating and implementing 
policies or regulations that preempt 
State law or that have Federalism 
implications. The Executive Order 
requires agencies to examine the 
constitutional and statutory authority 
supporting any action that would limit 
the policymaking discretion of the 
States and to carefully assess the 
necessity for such actions. The 
Executive Order also requires agencies 
to have an accountable process to 
ensure meaningful and timely input by 
State and local officials in the 
development of regulatory policies that 
have federalism implications. On March 
14, 2000, DOE published a statement of 
policy describing the intergovernmental 
consultation process it will follow in the 
development of such regulations. 65 FR 
13735. EPCA governs and prescribes 
Federal preemption of State regulations 
as to energy conservation for the 
products that are the subject of today’s 
proposed rule. States can petition DOE 
for exemption from such preemption to 
the extent, and based on criteria, set 
forth in EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6297) No 
further action is required by Executive 
Order 13132. 
F. Review Under Executive Order 12988 
With respect to the review of existing 
regulations and the promulgation of 
new regulations, section 3(a) of 
Executive Order 12988, ‘‘Civil Justice 
Reform,’’ imposes on Federal agencies 
the general duty to adhere to the 
following requirements: (1) Eliminate 
drafting errors and ambiguity; (2) write 
regulations to minimize litigation; and 
(3) provide a clear legal standard for 
affected conduct rather than a general 
standard and promote simplification 
and burden reduction. 61 FR 4729 (Feb. 
7, 1996). Section 3(b) of Executive Order 
12988 specifically requires that 
Executive agencies make every 
reasonable effort to ensure that the 
regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the 
preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly 
specifies any effect on existing Federal 
law or regulation; (3) provides a clear 
legal standard for affected conduct 
while promoting simplification and 
burden reduction; (4) specifies the 
retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately 
defines key terms; and (6) addresses 
other important issues affecting clarity 
and general draftsmanship under any 
guidelines issued by the Attorney 
General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 
12988 requires Executive agencies to 
review regulations in light of applicable 
standards in section 3(a) and section 
3(b) to determine whether they are met 
or it is unreasonable to meet one or 
more of them. DOE has completed the 
required review and determined that, to 
the extent permitted by law, this 
proposed rule meets the relevant 
standards of Executive Order 12988. 
G. Review Under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires 
each Federal agency to assess the effects 
of Federal regulatory actions on State, 
local, and Tribal governments and the 
private sector. Public Law 104–4, sec. 
201 (codified at 2 U.S.C. 1531). For a 
proposed regulatory action likely to 
result in a rule that may cause the 
expenditure by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector of $100 million or more 
in any one year (adjusted annually for 
inflation), section 202 of UMRA requires 
a Federal agency to publish a written 
statement that estimates the resulting 
costs, benefits, and other effects on the 
national economy. (2 U.S.C. 1532(a), (b)) 
The UMRA also requires a Federal 
agency to develop an effective process 
to permit timely input by elected 
officers of State, local, and Tribal 
governments on a proposed ‘‘significant 
intergovernmental mandate,’’ and 
requires an agency plan for giving notice 
and opportunity for timely input to 
potentially affected small governments 
before establishing any requirements 
that might significantly or uniquely 
affect small governments. On March 18, 
1997, DOE published a statement of 
policy on its process for 
intergovernmental consultation under 
UMRA. 62 FR 12820; also available at 
http://www.gc.doe.gov. 
Although today’s proposed rule does 
not contain a Federal intergovernmental 
mandate, it may require expenditures of 
$100 million or more on the private 
sector. Specifically, the proposed rule 
will likely result in a final rule that 
could require expenditures of $100 
million or more. Such expenditures may 
include (1) investment in research and 
development and in capital 
expenditures by microwave oven 
manufacturers in the years between the 
final rule and the compliance date for 
the new standard, and (2) incremental 
additional expenditures by consumers 
to purchase higher-efficiency 
microwave ovens, starting in 2014. 
Section 202 of UMRA authorizes an 
agency to respond to the content 
requirements of UMRA in any other 
statement or analysis that accompanies 
the proposed rule. 2 U.S.C. 1532(c). The 
content requirements of section 202(b) 
of UMRA relevant to a private sector 
mandate substantially overlap the 
economic analysis requirements that 
apply under section 325(o) of EPCA and 
Executive Order 12866. The 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of 
this supplemental notice of proposed 
rulemaking and the ‘‘Regulatory Impact 
Analysis,’’ chapter 17 of the TSD for this 
supplemental proposed rule, respond to 
those requirements. 
Under section 205 of UMRA, the 
Department is obligated to identify and 
consider a reasonable number of 
regulatory alternatives before 
promulgating a rule for which a written 
statement under section 202 is required. 
2 U.S.C. 1535(a). DOE is required to 
select from those alternatives the most 
cost-effective and least burdensome 
alternative that achieves the objectives 
of the rule unless DOE publishes an 
explanation for doing otherwise or the 
selection of such an alternative is 
inconsistent with law. As required by 42 
U.S.C. 6295(h) and (o), today’s proposed 
rule would establish energy 
conservation standards for microwave

oven standby mode and off mode that 
are designed to achieve the maximum 
improvement in energy use that DOE 
has determined to be both 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified. A full discussion 
of the alternatives considered by DOE is 
presented in chapter 17 of the TSD for 
today’s supplemental proposed rule. 
H. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 
Section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105–277) requires 
Federal agencies to issue a Family 
Policymaking Assessment for any rule 
that may affect family well-being. This 
rule would not have any impact on the 
autonomy or integrity of the family as 
an institution. Accordingly, DOE has 
concluded that it is not necessary to 
prepare a Family Policymaking 
Assessment. 
I. Review Under Executive Order 12630 
DOE has determined, under Executive 
Order 12630, ‘‘Governmental Actions 
and Interference with Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights’’ 53 FR 8859 
(March 18, 1988), that this regulation 
would not result in any takings that 
might require compensation under the 
Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
J. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 
Section 515 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516, note) 
provides for agencies to review most 
disseminations of information to the 
public under guidelines established by 
each agency pursuant to general 
guidelines issued by OMB. OMB’s 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), and DOE’s 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
62446 (Oct. 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed 
today’s SNOPR under the OMB and 
DOE guidelines and has concluded that 
it is consistent with applicable policies 
in those guidelines. 
K. Review Under Executive Order 13211 
Executive Order 13211, ‘‘Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use’’ 66 FR 28355 (May 
22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to 
prepare and submit to OIRA at OMB, a 
Statement of Energy Effects for any 
proposed significant energy action. A 
‘‘significant energy action’’ is defined as 
any action by an agency that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to 
promulgation of a final rule, and that (1) 
is a significant regulatory action under 
Executive Order 12866, or any successor 
order; and (2) is likely to have a 
significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution, or use of energy, or (3) is 
designated by the Administrator of 
OIRA as a significant energy action. For 
any proposed significant energy action, 
the agency must give a detailed 
statement of any adverse effects on 
energy supply, distribution, or use 
should the proposal be implemented, 
and of reasonable alternatives to the 
action and their expected benefits on 
energy supply, distribution, and use. 
DOE has tentatively concluded that 
today’s regulatory action, which sets 
forth energy conservation standards for 
microwave oven standby mode and off 
mode, is not a significant energy action 
because the proposed standards are not 
likely to have a significant adverse effect 
on the supply, distribution, or use of 
energy, nor has it been designated as 
such by the Administrator at OIRA. 
Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a 
Statement of Energy Effects on the 
proposed rule. 
L. Review Under the Information 
Quality Bulletin for Peer Review 
On December 16, 2004, OMB, in 
consultation with the Office of Science 
and Technology (OSTP), issued its Final 
Information Quality Bulletin for Peer 
Review (the Bulletin). 70 FR 2664 (Jan. 
14, 2005). The Bulletin establishes that 
certain scientific information shall be 
peer reviewed by qualified specialists 
before it is disseminated by the Federal 
Government, including influential 
scientific information related to agency 
regulatory actions. The purpose of the 
bulletin is to enhance the quality and 
credibility of the Government’s 
scientific information. Under the 
Bulletin, the energy conservation 
standards rulemaking analyses are 
‘‘influential scientific information,’’ 
which the Bulletin defines as ‘‘scientific 
information the agency reasonably can 
determine will have or does have a clear 
and substantial impact on important 
public policies or private sector 
decisions.’’ 70 FR 2664, 2667. 
In response to OMB’s Bulletin and as 
more fully set forth in the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE conducted formal in- 
progress peer reviews of the energy 
conservation standards development 
process and analyses and has prepared 
a Peer Review Report pertaining to the 
energy conservation standards 
rulemaking analyses. Generation of this 
report involved a rigorous, formal, and 
documented evaluation using objective 
criteria and qualified and independent 
reviewers to make a judgment as to the 
technical/scientific/business merit, the 
actual or anticipated results, and the 
productivity and management 
effectiveness of programs and/or 
projects. The ‘‘Energy Conservation 
Standards Rulemaking Peer Review 
Report’’ dated February 2007 has been 
disseminated and is available at the 
following Web site: http:// 
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliance_standards/peer_review.html.

public disclosure). 
E. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment 
Although DOE welcomes comments 
on any aspect of this proposal, DOE is 
particularly interested in receiving 
comments and views of interested 
parties concerning the following issues: 
1. Input and data regarding off mode 
power for microwave ovens; 
2. Input and data on the utility 
provided by specific features that 
contribute to microwave oven standby 
power. In particular, DOE seeks 
information on any lessening of the 
utility or the performance of microwave 
display technologies and low- and zero- 
standby power cooking sensors as 
compared to absolute humidity cooking 
sensors currently used in microwave 
ovens on the U.S. market. 
3. Input and data on control strategies 
available to enable manufacturers to 
make design tradeoffs between 
incorporating standby-power- 
consuming features such as displays or 
cooking sensors and including a 
function to turn power off to these 
components during standby mode. DOE 
also seeks comment on the viability and 
cost of microwave oven control board 
circuitry that could accommodate 
transistors to switch off cooking sensors 
and displays; 
4. Whether switching or similar 
modern power supplies can operate 
successfully inside a microwave oven 
and the associated efficiency impacts on 
standby power; 
5. Input and data on the estimated 
incremental manufacturing costs, as 
well as the assumed approaches to 
achieve TSL 3 for microwave oven 
standby mode and off mode. DOE also 
seeks comment on whether any 
intellectual property or patent 
infringement issues are associated with 
the design options presented in the 
SNOPR TSD to achieve TSL 3. In 
particular, DOE seeks comment on any 
lessening of competition due to 
intellectual property or patent 
infringement issues associated with 
low- and zero-standby power cooking 
sensors; 
6. Input and data on the estimated 
market share of microwave ovens at the 
standby power consumption stipulated 
by TSL 3. 
7. Information on any utility or 
performance impacts to built-ins at the 
standard level proposed by DOE. 
IX. Approval of the Office of the 
Secretary 
The Secretary of Energy has approved 
publication of today’s proposed rule.
