SECTION 1  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has characterized the facilities and 
companies potentially affected by the proposed reciprocating internal combustion engines 
(RICE) National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) by examining 
existing sources and the companies that own them.  
EPA estimates that complying with the proposed RICE rule will have an annualized cost 
of approximately $345 million per year (2007 dollars) in the year of full implementation of the 
rule (2013). Using these costs, EPA estimates in its economic impact analysis that the NESHAP 
will have limited impacts on the eight industries affected and their consumers. Using sales data 
obtained for affected small entities in an analysis of the impacts of this proposal on small 
entities, EPA expects that the proposed NESHAP will not result in a SISNOSE (a significant 
economic impacts for a substantial number of small entities). EPA also does not expect 
significant adverse energy impacts based on Executive Order 13211, an Executive Order that 
requires analysis of energy impacts for rules such as this one that are economically significant 
under Executive Order 12866.  
The proposed RICE rule is also considered subject to the requirements of the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Circular A-4 because EPA expects that either the benefits 
or the costs are potentially $1 billion or higher. EPA’s estimate of the benefits of the NESHAP, 
based on information from the PM2.5 expert elicitation study released in October, 2006 and other 
data, is a range from $0.9 billion to $2.0 billion (2007 dollars) in 2013. EPA believes that the 
benefits are likely to exceed the annualized costs of $345 million by a substantial margin under 
this rulemaking even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.

SECTION 2  
INTRODUCTION  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently preparing a proposed National 
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) to reduce hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) emissions from existing reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE). This 
rulemaking is on a court-ordered schedule to be proposed by February 25, 2009, and then 
promulgated by February 10, 2010. Regulations affecting new and reconstructed stationary 
diesel HAP and criteria pollutant emissions were issued in March 2004, July 2006, and 
December 2007. This latest rulemaking is meant to target those emissions sources (HAP, 
primarily) in the same industries that were not affected by these three different regulations. This 
rulemaking consists of a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard that will 
be applied to major sources of HAP emissions and a Generally Available Control Technology 
(GACT) standard that will be applied to area sources of HAP emissions. The proposed rule is 
economically significant according to Executive Order 12866. As part of the regulatory process 
of preparing these standards, EPA has prepared an economic impact analysis (RIA). This 
analysis includes an analysis of impacts to small entities as part of compliance with the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) and an analysis of impacts on energy 
consumption and production to comply with Executive Order 13211 (Statement of Energy 
Effects).  
2.1 Organization of this Report 
The remainder of this report supports and details the methodology and the results of the 
EIA: 
 Section 3 presents a profile of the affected industries. 
 Section 4 presents a summary of regulatory alternatives considered in the proposed 
rule, and provides the compliance costs of the rule.  
 Section 5 describes the estimated costs of the regulation and describes the EIA 
methodology and reports market, welfare, and energy impacts.  
 Section 6 presents estimated impacts on small entities. 
 Section 7 presents the benefits estimates.

SECTION 3  
INDUSTRY PROFILE 
This section provides an introduction to the industries affected by the proposed rule. The 
purpose is to give the reader a general understanding of the economic aspects of the industry; 
their relative size, relationships with other sectors in the economy, trends for the industries, and 
financial statistics. The sectors discussed are 
 electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, 
 oil and gas extraction (including marginal wells), 
 pipeline transportation of natural gas, 
 general medical and surgical hospitals, and 
 irrigation sets and welding equipment. 
3.1 Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution 
3.1.1 Overview 
Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution (NAICS 2211) is an industry 
group within the utilities sector (NAICS 22). It includes establishments that produce electrical 
energy or facilitate its transmission to the final consumer.  
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from electric power grew about 10% to over $373 billion 
($2007) (Table 3-1). At the same time, payroll rose about 6.5% and the number of employees 
decreased by over 5%. The number of establishments rose by over 15%, resulting in a decrease 
in average establishment revenue of almost 7%. Industrial production within NAICS 2211 has 
increased 25% since 1997 (Figure 3-1).  
Electric utility companies have traditionally been tightly regulated monopolies. Since 
1978, several laws and orders have been passed to encourage competition within the electricity 
market. In the late 1990s, many states began the process of restructuring their utility regulatory 
framework to support a competitive market. Following market manipulation in the early 2000s, 
however, several states have suspended their restructuring efforts. The majority (58%) of diesel 
power generators controlled by combined heat and power (CHP) or independent power 
producers are located in states undergoing active restructuring (Figure 3-2).

distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes. 
 Firm: A firm is a business organization consisting of one or more domestic 
establishments in the same state and industry that were specified under common 
ownership or control. The firm and the establishment are the same for single-
establishment firms. For each multiestablishment firm, establishments in the same 
industry within a state are counted as one firm; the firm employment and annual 
payroll are summed from the associated establishments. 
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise; the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
In 2002, Texas had almost 1,000 power establishments, while California, Georgia, and 
Ohio all had between 400 and 500 (Figure 3-3). Hawaii, Nebraska, and Rhode Island all had 
fewer than 20 establishments in their states.

As shown in Table 3-3, the four largest firms owned over 1,200 establishments and 
accounted for about 16% of total industry receipts/revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for 
almost 6,000 establishments and about 78% of total receipts/revenue.  
Investor-owned energy providers accounted for 67.5% of retail electricity sold in the 
United States in 2006 (Table 3-4). In 2007, less regulated investor-owned electric utility 
companies were on average more profitable than companies with greater regulation (Table 3-5). 
In 2006, enterprises within NAICS 2211 had a pre-tax profit margin of only 0.9% (Table 3-6). 
In 2002, about 82% of firms generating, transmitting, or distributing electric power had 
receipts of under $50 million (Table 3-7). However, these firms accounted for only 11% of 
employment, with 89% of employees working for firms with revenues in excess of $100 million. 
3.2 Oil and Gas Extraction 
3.2.1 Overview

through such activities as exploring for oil and gas, drilling and equipping wells, operating on-
site equipment, and conducting other activities up to the point of shipment from the property.  
Oil and gas extraction consists of two industries: crude petroleum and natural gas 
extraction (NAICS 211111) and natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112). Crude petroleum 
and natural gas extraction is the larger industry; in 2002, it accounted for 93% of establishments 
and 75% of oil and gas extraction revenues. 
Industrial production in this industry is particularly sensitive to hurricanes in the Gulf 
Coast. In September of both 2005 and 2008, production dropped 14% from the previous month. 
Production is currently 6% lower than it was in 1997 (Figure 3-4). 
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from crude petroleum and natural gas extraction (NAICS 
211111) grew less than 1% to almost $100 billion ($2007) (Table 3-8). At the same time, payroll 
dropped almost 8% and the number of employees dropped by almost 6%. The number of 
establishments dropped by over 8%; as a result, the average establishment revenue increased by 
2.5%. Materials costs were approximately 25% of revenue over the period. 
From 1997 to 2002, revenue from natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112) grew 
over 7% to about $34 billion (Table 3-9). At the same time, payroll dropped 12% and the number 
of employees dropped by almost 9%. The number of establishments dropped by over 3%, 
resulting in an increase of revenue per establishment of about 10%.

3.2.2 Goods and Services Used 
The oil and gas extraction industry has similar labor and tax requirements as the electric 
power generation sector. Extraction, support, power, and equipment requirements potentially 
associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines (oil and gas extraction, support 
activities, electric power generation, machinery and equipment rental and leasing, and pipeline 
transportation) represent around 8% of the value of services (Table 3-10). 
3.2.3 Business Statistics 
The U.S. Economic Census and SUSB programs provide national information on the 
distribution of economic variables by industry, location, and size of business. Throughout this

This industry includes small-volume wells that are mature in age, are more difficult to extract oil 
or natural gas from than other types of wells, and generally operate at very low levels of 
profitability. As a result, well operations can be quite responsive to small changes in the benefits 
and costs of their operation. 
In 2006, there were approximately 420,000 marginal oil wells and 300,000 marginal gas 
wells (Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission [IOGCC], 2007). These wells provide the 
United States with 18% of oil and 9% of natural gas (IOGCC, 2007). Data for 2006 show that 
revenue from the over 700,000 wells was approximately $31.3 billion (Table 3-14). 
Historical data show marginal oil production fluctuated between 1997 and 2006, 
reflecting the industry’s sensitivity to changes in economic conditions of fuel markets (see

Figure 3-7). In contrast, the number of marginal gas wells has continually increased during the 
past decade; the IOGCC estimates that daily production levels from these wells reached a 
10-year high in 2005. Although we have been unable to find data on what fraction of these 
marginal wells are operated by small businesses, the IOGCC states that many are run by “mom 
and pop operators” (IOGCC, 2007). 
3.3 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas 
3.3.1 Overview 
Pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 48621) is an industry group within the 
transportation and warehousing sector (NAICS 48-49), but more specifically in the pipeline 
transportation subsector (486). It includes the transmission of natural gas as well as the 
distribution of the gas through a local network to participating businesses.  
From 1997 to 2002, natural gas transportation revenues fell by 7% to just under $23 
billion ($2007) (Table 3-15). At the same time, payroll decreased by 7%, while the number of 
paid employees decreased by nearly 9%. However, the number of establishments increased by 
17% from 1,450 establishments in 1997 to 1,701 in 2002. 
3.3.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports pipeline transportation of natural gas only for total pipeline 
transportation (3-digit NAICS 486). In addition to pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 
4862), this industry includes pipeline transportation of crude oil (NAICS 4861) and other 
pipeline transportation (NAICS 4869. However, the BEA data are likely representative of the 
affected sector since pipeline transportation of natural gas accounts for 68% of NAICS 486 
establishments and 72% of revenues (Figures 3-8 and 3-9).

associated with pipeline transportation. Power and equipment requirements potentially associated 
with reciprocating internal combustion engines (electric power generation and commercial and 
industrial machinery and equipment repair and maintenance) represent less than 2% of the value 
of services.

3.3.3 Business Statistics 
The pipeline transportation of natural gas is clearly concentrated in the two states closest 
to the refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2002, Texas and Louisiana contributed to 31% of all 
pipeline transportation establishments in the United States (Figure 3-10) and 41% of all U.S. 
revenues. Other larger contributors with over 50 establishments in their states include Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

Geographic Distribution—Pipeline transportation of natural gas: 2002.” <http://factfinder.census.gov>; 
(November 10, 2008). 
According to 2002 U.S. Census data, about 86% of transportation of natural gas 
establishments were owned by corporations and about 8% were owned by individual 
proprietorships. About 6% were owned by partnerships (Figure 3-11). As shown in Table 3-17, 
the four largest firms accounted for nearly half of the establishments with 698, and just over half, 
51%, of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,354 establishments and about 
99% of total revenue. The average number of employees per establishment was approximately 
17 across all groups of firms.  
Enterprises within pipeline transportation (NAICS 486) generated $6.6 billion in total 
receipts in 2006. Including those enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after-
tax profit margin of 7.9% (Table 3-18). 
The 2002 SUSB shows that 47% of all firms in this industry made under $5 million in 
revenue. Enterprises with revenue over $100 million provided an overwhelming share of 
employment in this industry (98%) (Table 3-19).

3.4 General Medical and Surgical Hospitals 
3.4.1 Overview 
General medical and surgical hospitals (NAICS 6221) is an industry group within the 
health care and social assistance sector (NAICS 62). It includes hospitals engaged in diagnostic 
and medical treatment (both surgical and nonsurgical) for inpatients with a broad range of 
medical conditions. They usually provide other services as well, including outpatient care, 
anatomical pathology, diagnostic X-rays, clinical laboratory work, and pharmacy services.  
From 1997 to 2002, hospital revenues grew about 18% to over $500 billion ($2007) 
(Table 3-20). At the same time, payroll rose about 14%, while the number of employees 
increased by only 5%. The number of establishments declined during this period by almost 6%, 
resulting in an increase in revenue per establishment of almost 22%. 
3.4.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports hospital expenditures only for hospitals (3-digit NAICS 622). In 
addition to general hospitals (NAICS 6221), this industry includes psychiatric and substance 
abuse hospitals (NAICS 6222) and specialty hospitals (NAICS 6223). However, these data 
should be representative of the affected sector since in 2002, general medical and surgical 
hospitals accounted for 92% of NAICS 622 establishments and 94% of revenues. 
In Table 3-21, we use the latest detailed benchmark input-output data report by the BEA 
(2002) to identify the goods and services used by hospitals (NAICS 622). As shown, labor and 
land requirements represent a significant share of the value of hospital services. Power and 
equipment requirements potentially associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines 
(electric power generation and commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair and 
maintenance) represent less than 2% of the value of services.

(November 10, 2008). 
According to 2002 Census data, 79.6% of general hospitals were owned by corporations, 
19.5% were individual proprietorships, and about 0.7% were partnerships (Figure 3-13). As 
shown in Table 3-22, the four largest firms accounted for almost 400 establishments and about 
10% of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,100 establishments and about 
30% of total revenue. In addition, about 27% of all general hospitals are owned or controlled by 
the government, with most of those at the local level (Table 3-23). 
In 2006, the United States had 4,927 community hospitals (Table 3-24); 
nongovernmental not-for-profit hospitals accounted for 59% of these hospitals, and 75% of the 
expenses of all community hospitals.  
Enterprises including hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities, and social 
assistance (NAICS 622-4) generated $108 billion in total receipts in 2006. Including those 
enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after- tax profit margin of 3.1% (Table 
3-25).

3.5 Irrigation Sets and Welding Equipment 
3.5.1 Overview 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies irrigation equipment under the farm machinery and 
equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333111). This U.S. industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing agricultural and farm machinery and 
equipment and other turf and grounds care equipment, including planting, harvesting, and grass-
mowing equipment (except lawn and garden type).  
From 1997 to 2002, farm machinery and equipment manufacturing revenues fell by $3 
billion from $18 billion to $15 billion (Table 3-27). At the same time, payroll decreased by 19% 
and the number of paid employees decreased by nearly 19%. The number of establishments 
dropped by 9% from 1,339 establishments in 1997 to 1,214 in 2002. Industrial production in the 
industry is currently 13% lower than in 1997 (Figure 3-14). 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies welding equipment under the welding and 
soldering equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333992). This U.S. industry 
comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing welding and soldering equipment 
and accessories (except transformers), such as welding electrodes, welding wire, and soldering 
equipment (except handheld). 
From 1997 to 2002 welding and soldering equipment manufacturing revenue fell by 
about 22% to $1 billion (Table 3-28). At the same time, payroll decreased by 21% and the 
number of paid employees decreased by nearly 28%. The number of establishments dropped by 
8% from 250 establishments in 1997 to 231 in 2002. 
3.5.2 Irrigation and Welding Services 
The demand for equipment is derived from the demand for the services the equipment 
provides. We describe uses and industrial consumers of this equipment. 
3.5.2.1 Irrigation 
Demand for irrigation equipment is driven by farm operation decisions, optimal 
replacement considerations, and climate and weather conditions. The National Agriculture 
Statistics Service (NASS) 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (USDA-NASS, 2004) shows

that the top five states ranked by total acres irrigated are California, Nebraska, Texas, Arkansas, 
and Idaho. Approximately 32 million of the 53 million, or 68%, of U.S. irrigated acres are used 
to support oilseed and grain farming and other crop farming (tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and 
other). 
The survey reported that approximately 500,000 pumps were used on U.S. farms in 2003 
with energy expenses totaling $1.6 billion. Electricity is the dominant form of energy expense for 
irrigation pumps, accounting for 60% of total energy expenses. Diesel fuel is second (18%), 
followed by natural gas (18%) and other forms of energy such as gasoline (4%).  
Per-acre operating costs for these irrigation systems vary by fuel type, and natural gas 
was the most expensive in 2003 ($57 per acre for well systems and $34 per acre for surface water 
systems) (Table 3-29). Systems using diesel fuel were operated at approximately half of these 
per-acre costs ($25 per acre for well systems and $16 per acre for surface water systems). 
Gasoline- and gasohol-powered systems offered the least expensive operating costs ($12 per acre 
for well systems and $18 per acre for surface water systems).  
As shown in Table 3-30, the number of on-farm pumps fell from 508,727 to 497,443 
(2%) between 1998 and 2003. However, the use of electric- and diesel-powered pumps increased 
during this period (3% and 4%, respectively), while other fuel sources such as gasoline declined 
significantly. Pumps powered by gasoline and gasohol, for example, declined from 8,965 to 
6,178, a 31% change during this period. Pumps powered by natural gas, LP gas, propane, and 
butane also declined by 26% to 29%. Although 1998 operating cost data are not available, the 
change in relative costs of operation across fuels between 1998 and 2003 may partly explain

these patterns. Although no information is available on the use and construction of on-farm 
pumps specifically, their use is tied to the amount of agricultural land in production. USDA 
reports that planted acres of the eight major crops hit a 5-year high of 252 million acres in 2008 
but will fall and level off to around 244 million acres over the next 2 to 4 years (USDA, 2008). 
3.5.2.2 Welding  
Welding is used in a wide variety of applications. One of the biggest manufacturers of 
welding products identifies the following key end-user segments: 
 general metal fabrication; 
 infrastructure including oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges, 
and power generation; 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
3-32 
 transportation and defense industries (automotive, trucks, rail, ships, and 
aerospace); 
 equipment manufacturers in construction, farming, and mining; 
 retail resellers; and 
 rental market (Lincoln Electric Holdings, 2006). 
Lincoln Electric further describes the following key applications: power generation and process 
industries, offshore production of oil and gas, pipelines/pipemills, and heavy fabrication 
(earthmoving and construction equipment and agricultural and farm equipment. 
3.5.3 Business Statistics 
In 2003, California and Texas each had more than 5 million irrigated acres (Figure 3-15). 
Midwest states like Arkansas and Nebraska had more than 2.5 million irrigated acres. Heavy and 
civil engineering construction establishments are spread throughout the United States, 
particularly in areas such as California, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida (Figure 3-16). Each 
of these states has more than 2,000 establishments.

As shown in Table 3-31, the market value of agriculture products sold was less than 
$25,000 per year on almost half the irrigated farms in the 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation 
Survey. Over 90% of the irrigated farms had agricultural product revenue below $750,000. It is 
not clear what fraction of these farms use stationary diesel engines or are owned by corporate 
farming operations. However, SUSB data also suggest 65% of firms in NAICS 11 have receipts 
less than $500,000 per year.

As noted earlier, welding equipment is used in heavy fabrication such as earthmoving and 
construction equipment. We focus on the size distribution for a representative sector in this 
section (NAICS 327, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction); other subsections in Section 2 
cover other sectors that potentially use equipment powered by diesel engines (e.g., power 
generation and offshore gas distribution). As shown in Table 3-33, SUSB data suggest 60% of 
firms in this industry have receipts less than $1 million per year; 90% are below the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) threshold on $50 million per year. However, it is not clear what 
fraction of these firms use stationary diesel engines.

SECTION 4  
REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES, COSTS, AND EMISSION IMPACTS 
4.1 Background 
This action proposes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) from 
existing stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) with a site rating of less 
than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources, and existing stationary RICE located at area 
sourcesThe final NESHAP for stationary RICE would be promulgated under 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart ZZZZ, which already contains standards applicable to new stationary RICE and existing 
stationary RICE with a site rating above 500 hp located at major sources.    In addition, EPA is 
proposing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for existing stationary 
compression ignition engines greater than 500 brake horsepower that are located at major 
sources, based on a new review of these engines following the first RICE NESHAP rulemaking 
in 2004.  In addition, EPA is proposing to amend the previously promulgated regulations 
regarding operation of stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines during periods of 
startup, shutdown and malfunction. EPA is proposing these requirements to meet its statutory 
obligation to address hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions from these sources under sections 
112(d) and 112(k) of the CAA. 
EPA promulgated NESHAP (in this case, a MACT standard) for existing, new, and 
reconstructed stationary RICE greater than 500 hp located at major sources on June 15, 2004 
(69 FR 33474). EPA promulgated NESHAP for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that are 
located at area sources of HAP emissions and for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that 
have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 hp that are located at major sources of HAP 
emissions on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 3568). At that time, EPA did not promulgate a final 
decision for existing stationary RICE that are located at area sources of HAP emissions or for 
existing stationary RICE that have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 hp that are located at 
major sources of HAP emissions due to comments received indicating that the proposed MACT 
determinations for existing sources were inappropriate and because of a U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling on March 13, 2007, involving litigation on the “Brick 
MACT,” which set emission standards for major sources in that source category (40 CFR part 
63, subpart JJJJJ), that appeared to impact EPA’s ability to finalize its proposed “no reduction” 
MACT standards for existing sources. Sierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875 (DC Cir 2007). Among 
other things, the D.C. Circuit found that EPA’s no emission reduction MACT determination in 
the challenged rule was unlawful. Because in the proposed stationary RICE rule EPA used a 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-2 
MACT floor methodology similar to the methodology used in the Brick MACT, EPA decided to 
re-evaluate the MACT floors for existing major sources that have a site rating of less than or 
equal to 500 brake hp consistent with the Court’s decision in the Brick MACT case. EPA has 
also re-evaluated the standards for existing area sources in light of the comments received on the 
proposed rule.  
This proposal initiates a separate rulemaking process that focuses on existing sources. 
EPA has gathered further information on existing engines and has considered comments it 
received on the original proposed rule and the intervening court decision in creating this 
proposed rulemaking.  
In addition, stakeholders have encouraged the Agency to review whether there are further 
ways to reduce emissions of pollutants from existing stationary diesel engines. In its comments 
on EPA’s 2006 proposed rule for new stationary diesel engines,1
 
Environmental Defense Fund 
suggested several possible avenues for the regulation of existing stationary diesel engines, 
including use of diesel oxidation catalysts or catalyzed diesel particulate filters (CDPF), as well 
as the use of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. Environmental Defense Fund suggested that 
such controls can provide significant pollution reductions at reasonable cost. EPA issued an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in January 2008, where it solicited comment 
on several issues concerning options to regulate emissions of pollutants from existing stationary 
diesel engines, generally, and specifically from larger, older stationary diesel engines. EPA 
solicited comment and collected information to aid decision-making related to the reduction of 
HAP emissions from existing stationary diesel engines and specifically from larger, older 
engines under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 authorities. The Agency sought comment on the 
larger, older engines because available data indicate that those engines emit the majority of 
particulate matter (PM) and toxic emissions from non-emergency stationary engines as a whole.  
EPA has taken several actions over the past several years to reduce exhaust pollutants 
from stationary diesel engines, but believes that further reducing exhaust pollutants from 
stationary diesel engines, particularly existing stationary diesel engines that have not been 
subject to Federal standards, are justified. Therefore, EPA is proposing emissions reductions 
from existing stationary diesel engines.

4.2 Summary of the Proposed Rule 
4.2.1 What Is the Source Category Regulated by this Proposed Rule?  
This proposed rule addresses emissions from existing stationary engines less than or 
equal to 500 hp located at major sources and all stationary engines located at area sources. A 
major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single 
HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate 
of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a 
major source of HAP emissions is determined for each surface site. An area source of HAP 
emissions is a source that is not a major source. This proposed rule also addresses emissions 
from existing compression ignition (CI) engines greater than 500 hp located at major sources. 
4.2.1.1 Stationary RICE ≤500 hp at Major Sources 
This action proposes to revise 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, to address HAP emissions 
from existing stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources. For 
stationary engines less than or equal to 500 hp at major sources, EPA must determine what is the 
appropriate MACT for those engines under section 112(d)(3) of the CAA. 
EPA has divided the source category into the following subcategories: stationary RICE 
less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, CI 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, and spark ignition (SI) stationary RICE greater 
than or equal to 50 hp. The CI stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp subcategory was 
further subcategorized into emergency and non-emergency engines, as was the subcategory of SI 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp. Spark ignition non-emergency stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 50 hp were then subcategorized into 2-stroke lean burn (2SLB), 4-stroke 
lean burn (4SLB), and 4-stroke rich burn (4SRB) stationary RICE. The 2SLB and 4SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp subcategories were further subcategorized into 
below 250 hp and greater than or equal to 250 hp. 
4.2.1.2 Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
This action proposes to revise 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, in order to address HAP 
emissions from existing stationary RICE located at area sources. For stationary engines located 
at area sources, EPA has the flexibility to promulgate standards based on generally available 
control technology or management practices (GACT) under CAA section 112(d)(5). EPA is 
required to address HAP emissions from stationary RICE located at area sources under section 
112(k) of the CAA, based on criteria set forth by EPA in the Urban Air Toxics Strategy. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-4 
The subcategories for area sources are the same as those for major sources and are: 
stationary RICE less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal 
to 50 hp, CI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, CI non-emergency 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, SI emergency stationary RICE greater than or 
equal to 50 hp, SI non-emergency 2SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less 
than 250 hp, SI non-emergency 2SLB greater than or equal to 250 hp, SI non-emergency 4SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, SI non-emergency 4SLB 
greater than or equal to 250 hp, and SI non-emergency 4SRB stationary RICE greater than or 
equal to 50 hp.  
4.2.1.3 Stationary CI RICE >500 hp at Major Sources 
In addition, EPA is proposing emission standards for stationary CI engines greater than 
500 hp at major sources under its authority to review and revise emission standards as necessary 
under section 112(d)(6) of the CAA. 
4.2.2 What Are the Pollutants Regulated by this Proposed Rule? 
The rule being proposed in this action would regulate emissions of HAP. Available 
emissions data show that several HAP, which are formed during the combustion process or 
which are contained within the fuel burned, are emitted from stationary engines. The HAP which 
have been measured in emission tests conducted on natural gas fired and diesel fired RICE 
include: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,3-butadiene, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, acetaldehyde, acrolein, 
benzene, chlorobenzene, chloroethane, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, methanol, methylene 
chloride, n-hexane, naphthalene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic organic matter, 
styrene, tetrachloroethane, toluene, and xylene. Metallic HAP from diesel fired stationary RICE 
that have been measured are: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and 
selenium. 
EPA described the health effects of these HAP and other HAP emitted from the operation 
of stationary RICE in the preamble to 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, published on June 15, 
2004 (69 FR 33474). These HAP emissions are known to cause, or contribute significantly to air 
pollution, which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. 
EPA is proposing to limit emissions of HAP through emissions standards for 
formaldehyde for non-emergency 4SRB engines, emergency SI engines, and engines less than 50 
HP, and through emission standards for carbon monoxide (CO) for all other engines. For the 
RICE NESHAP promulgated in 2004 (69 FR 33474) for engines greater than 500 HP located at 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-5 
major sources, EPA chose to select formaldehyde to serve as a surrogate for HAP emissions. 
Formaldehyde is the hazardous air pollutant present in the highest concentration in the exhaust 
from stationary engines. In addition, emissions data show that formaldehyde emission levels are 
related to other HAP emission levels.  
For the NESHAP promulgated in 2004, EPA also found that there is a relationship 
between CO emissions reductions and HAP emissions reductions from 2SLB, 4SLB, and CI 
stationary engines. Therefore, because testing for CO emissions has many advantages over 
testing for formaldehyde, CO emissions were chosen as a surrogate for HAP emissions 
reductions for 2SLB, 4SLB, and CI stationary engines operating with oxidation catalyst systems 
for that rule. However, EPA could not confirm the same relationship between CO and 
formaldehyde for 4SRB engines, so emission standards for such engines were provided in terms 
of formaldehyde.  
For the standards being proposed in this action, EPA believes that previous decisions 
regarding the appropriateness of using formaldehyde and CO both in concentration (ppm) levels 
as has been done for stationary sources before as surrogates for HAP are still valid.2 
Consequently, EPA is proposing emission standards for formaldehyde for 4SRB engines and 
emission standards for CO for lean burn and CI engines in order to regulate HAP emissions. 
Information EPA has received from stationary engine manufacturers indicate that most SI 
emergency engines and engines below 50 HP are and will be 4SRB engines. As discussed above, 
EPA could not confirm a relationship between CO and formaldehyde emissions for 4SRB 
engines. Therefore, EPA is proposing standards for formaldehyde for those engines. 
We recognize that stationary diesel engines emit trace amounts of metal HAP that remain 
in the particle phase. EPA believes that formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total 
HAP. Although metal HAP emissions from existing diesel engines are very small – about 130 
tons per year – we are interested in receiving comments and data about more appropriate 
surrogates, if any, for the metallic HAP emissions. 
In addition to reducing HAP and CO, the proposed rule would likely result in the 
reduction of PM emissions from existing diesel engines. The aftertreatment technologies 
expected to be used to reduce HAP and CO emissions also reduce emissions of PM from diesel 
                                                 
2 In contrast, mobile source emission standards for diesel engines (both nonroad and on-highway) are promulgated 
on a mass basis rather than concentration. 
 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-6 
engines. Furthermore, this proposed rule would also result in nitrogen oxides (NOx) reductions 
from rich burn engines since these engines would likely need to install non-selective catalytic 
reduction (NSCR) technology that helps reduce NOx in addition to CO and HAP emissions. 
Also, the proposed rule requires the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for stationary non-
emergency CI engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder 
that use diesel fuel, which would result in lower emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and sulfate 
particulate by reducing the sulfur content in the fuel.  
4.2.3 What Are the Proposed Standards? 
4.2.3.1 Existing Stationary RICE at Major Sources  
The emission standards proposed in this action for stationary RICE less than or equal to 
500 hp located at major sources and stationary CI RICE greater than 300 hp located at major 
sources are shown in Table 4-1.

In addition, certain existing stationary RICE located at major sources are subject to fuel 
requirements. Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI engines greater 
than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder located at major sources that 
use diesel fuel must use only diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 80.510(b), which 
requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 parts per million (ppm) and either 
a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent.

4.2.3.3 Operating Limitations 
The EPA is proposing operating limitations for stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 
4SRB, and CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source, and stationary 
non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at a major source. Owners 
and operators of engines that are equipped with oxidation catalyst or NSCR must maintain the 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-10 
catalyst so that the pressure drop across the catalyst does not change by more than 2 inches of 
water from the pressure drop across the catalyst that was measured during the initial performance 
test. Owners and operators of these engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary 
RICE exhaust so that the catalyst inlet temperature is between 450 and 1,350°F for engines with 
an oxidation catalyst and 750 to 1,250°F for engines with NSCR. Owners and operators of 
engines that are not using oxidation catalyst or NSCR must comply with any operating 
limitations approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.3.4 Fuel Requirements 
In addition to emission standards and management practices, certain stationary CI RICE 
located at existing area sources are subject to fuel requirements. Owners and operators of 
stationary non-emergency CI engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 
liters per cylinder located at existing area sources that use diesel fuel must only use diesel fuel 
meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 80.510(b), which requires that diesel fuel have a maximum 
sulfur content of 15 ppm and either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic 
content of 35 volume percent.  
4.2.3.5 New or Reconstructed Stationary RICE >500 HP at Major Sources, New or 
Reconstructed 4SLB Stationary RICE ≥ 250 HP at Major Sources and Existing 4SRB 
Stationary RICE >500 HP at Major Sources 
 
 The EPA is co-proposing, in the alternative, as explained below, to amend the existing 
regulations for new and reconstructed non-emergency 2SLB and CI stationary RICE >500 HP at 
major sources, new and reconstructed non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE ≥ 250 HP at major 
sources, and existing 4SRB stationary RICE >500 HP at major sources, in order to set limits 
during periods of startup and malfunction.  These emission limitations are shown in Table 4-3.  
Note that EPA is also co-proposing that the same standards apply during both normal operation 
and periods of startup and malfunctions. 
4.2.3.6  Operating Limitations and Management Practices 
 The EPA is proposing operating limitations for existing stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 
4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE that are greater than 500 HP and are located at an area source, and 
stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 HP and are located at a major 
source. These are large sources that are subject to proposed standards that would require the use 
of aftertreatment.  Owners and operators of engines that are equipped with oxidation catalyst or 
NSCR must maintain the catalyst so that the pressure drop across the catalyst does not change by 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009

more than 2 inches of water from the pressure drop across the catalyst that was measured during 
the initial performance test.

Limit concentration of CO in the stationary RICE exhaust 
to 77 ppmvd or less at 15 percent O2 during periods of

Owners and operators of these engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary 
RICE exhaust so that the catalyst inlet temperature is between 450 and 1350 degrees Fahrenheit 
(°F) for engines with an oxidation catalyst and 750 to 1250°F for engines with NSCR. Owners 
and operators of engines that are not using oxidation catalyst or NSCR must comply with any 
operating limitations approved by the Administrator. 
 As shown in Table 4-2 above, the EPA is also proposing management practices for 
several subcategories of engines located at area sources. Such management practices include 
maintenance requirements that are expected to ensure that emission control systems are working 
properly. EPA asks for comments on these management practices and requests suggestions of 
additional maintenance requirements that may be needed for some of these engine subcategories.  
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009

4.2.4 What Are the Requirements for Demonstrating Compliance? 
The following sections describe the requirements for demonstrating compliance under the 
proposed rule. 
4.2.4.5 Stationary RICE at Major Sources  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are less than 100 hp and stationary emergency RICE located at major sources must operate and 
maintain their stationary RICE and aftertreatment control device (if any) according to the 
manufacturer’s emission-related written instructions or develop their own maintenance plan. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are less 
than 100 hp and stationary emergency RICE located at major sources do not have to conduct any 
performance testing.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are greater than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp must conduct an initial 
performance test to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are greater than 500 hp must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 8,760 hours 
of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are achieving the 
required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp 
and are located at a major source must continuously monitor and record the catalyst inlet 
temperature if an oxidation catalyst is being used on the engine. The pressure drop across the 
catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation catalyst is not being used on the engine, 
the owner or operator must continuously monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) 
approved by the Administrator.  
4.2.4.6 Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
Owners and operators of stationary emergency RICE located at existing area sources and 
stationary RICE that are located at existing area sources that are not subject to any numerical 
emission standards, as shown in Table 4-2, must operate and maintain their stationary RICE and 
after-treatment control device (if any) according to the manufacturer’s emission-related written 
instructions or develop their own maintenance plan. Owners and operators of stationary RICE 
that are located at existing area sources that are not subject to any numerical emission standards 
do not have to conduct any performance testing.  
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-13 
Owners and operators of stationary RICE that are located at existing area sources subject 
to numerical emission standards, as shown in Table 4-2, must conduct an initial performance test 
to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at existing area sources 
that are greater than 500 hp must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 8,760 
hours of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are achieving the 
required emission standards. 
In addition to emission standards and management practices, certain stationary CI RICE 
located at existing area sources are subject to fuel requirements.  These fuel requirements are 
proposed in order to reduce the potential formation of sulfate compounds that are emitted when 
high sulfur diesel fuel is used in combination with oxidation catalysts and to assist in the efficient 
operation of the oxidation catalysts. Thus, owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 
diesel-fueled CI engines greater than 300 HP with a displacement of less than 30 liters per 
cylinder located at existing area sources must only use diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 
CFR 80.510(b), which requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm and 
either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE 
that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source must continuously monitor and 
record the catalyst inlet temperature if an oxidation catalyst or NSCR is being used on the 
engine. The pressure drop across the catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation 
catalyst or NSCR is not being used on the engine, the owner or operator must continuously 
monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.5 What Are the Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements? 
The following sections describe the reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are 
required under the proposed rule. 
Owners and operators of stationary emergency RICE that do not meet the requirements 
for non-emergency engines are required to keep records of their hours of operation. Owners and 
operators of stationary emergency RICE must install a non-resettable hour meter on their engines 
to record the necessary information. Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for the 
purpose of maintenance checks and readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended 
by the Federal, State or local government, the manufacturer, the vendor, or the insurance 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-14 
company associated with the engine. Maintenance checks and readiness testing of such units is 
limited to 100 hours per year. Owners and operators can petition the Administrator for additional 
hours, beyond the allowed 100 hours per year, if such additional hours should prove to be 
necessary for maintenance and testing reasons. A petition is not required if the hours beyond 100 
hours per year for maintenance and testing purposes are mandated by regulation such as State or 
local requirements. There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary engines in 
emergency situations, however, the owner or operator is required to record the length of 
operation and the reason the engine was in operation during that time. Records must be 
maintained documenting why the engine was operating to ensure the 100 hours per year limit for 
maintenance and testing operation is not exceeded. In addition, owners and operators are allowed 
to operate their stationary emergency RICE for non-emergency purposes for 50 hours per year, 
but those 50 hours are counted towards the total 100 hours provided for operation other than for 
true emergencies and owners and operators may not engage in income-generating activities 
during those 50 hours. The 50 hours per year for non-emergency purposes cannot be used to 
generate income for a facility, for example, to supply power to an electric grid or otherwise 
supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE located at area sources, that are subject 
to management practices as shown in Table 2, are required to keep records that show that 
management practices that are required are being met.  Such records are to be kept on-site by 
owners and operators.  These records must include, but may not be limited to: oil and filter 
change dates, oil amounts added and corresponding hour on the hour meter, fuel consumption 
rates, air filter change dates, records of repairs and other maintenance performed. 
In terms of reporting requirements, owners and operators of existing stationary RICE, 
except stationary RICE that are less than 100 hp, existing emergency stationary RICE, and 
existing stationary RICE that are not subject to any numerical emission standards, must submit 
all of the applicable notifications as listed in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A), including initial an initial notification, notification of performance test, and a 
notification of compliance for each stationary RICE which must comply with the specified 
emission limitations.  
4.3 Rationale for Proposed Rule 
4.3.3 Which Control Technologies Apply to Stationary RICE? 
EPA reviewed various control technologies applicable to stationary engines. For detailed 
information on the control technology review that EPA conducted, refer to information in the 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-15 
docket for this proposed rule. The following sections provide general descriptions of currently 
available controls that can be used to reduce emissions from stationary engines. 
Non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) has been commercially available for many 
years and has been widely used on stationary engines. The technology can be applied to rich 
burn stationary engines and is capable of significantly reducing HAP emissions from stationary 
RICE. The technology is also capable of considerably reducing CO and NOx emissions from rich 
burn stationary RICE. Based on available information, NSCR appears to be technically feasible 
for rich burn engines down to 25 hp. 
Oxidation catalyst is another type of aftertreatment that can be applied to stationary 
engines and is typically used with lean burn engines. The technology can be applied to either 
diesel or gas fired lean burn engines. Significant reductions in HAP and CO are achieved with 
oxidation catalyst and applying the technology to diesel fired engines also yields PM emissions 
reductions. Oxidation catalyst control has been widely used and has been available for decades 
for use with lean burn stationary engines. While oxidation catalysts are very effective at reducing 
HAP and CO emissions, there is some concern about increasing NO2 emissions as a result of 
using highly catalyzed devices. Thus, EPA requests comments and information on the potential 
increase in NO2 emissions and any strategies to help reduce their formation. 
Catalyzed diesel particulate filters (CDPF) are applicable to CI engines using diesel fuel 
and are primarily used to reduce PM emissions. The technology is a newer technology than other 
aftertreatment control devices, but is becoming increasingly widespread. Applying CDPF can 
significantly reduce PM emissions, while also limiting emissions of HAP and CO. Catalyzed 
diesel particulate filters are the basis for the Tier 4 emission standards for PM for most nonroad 
CI engines regulated by 40 CFR part 1039 and also for most new non-emergency stationary CI 
engines regulated under 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII. Recently finalized standards for stationary 
CI engines in California are also based on the use of particulate filters in some cases. 
4.3.4 How Did EPA Determine the Basis and Level of the Proposed Standards? 
4.3.4.5 Stationary RICE at Major Sources 
Section 112 of the CAA requires that EPA establish NESHAP for the control of HAP 
from new and existing sources in regulated source categories. The CAA requires the NESHAP 
for major sources to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP that is 
achievable. This level of control is commonly referred to as the MACT. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-16 
The MACT floor is the minimum control level allowed for NESHAP and is defined 
under section 112(d)(3) of the CAA. In essence, the MACT floor ensures that the standards are 
set at a level that assures that all major sources achieve the level of control at least as stringent as 
that already achieved by the better controlled and lower emitting sources in each source category 
or subcategory. 
The MACT floor standards for existing sources must be no less stringent than the average 
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of existing sources in the category or 
subcategory (or the best performing 5 sources for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 
sources). The MACT standard must be no less stringent than the MACT floor.  
In developing MACT, EPA also considers control options that are more stringent than the 
floor. EPA may establish standards more stringent than the floor (or, “beyond-the-floor”) based 
on the consideration of cost of achieving the emissions reductions, any non-air quality health and 
environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Section 112 of the CAA allows EPA to 
establish subcategories among a group of sources, based on criteria that differentiate such 
sources. The subcategories that have been developed for stationary RICE were previously listed 
and are necessary in order to capture the distinct differences, which could affect the emissions of 
HAP from these engines. The complete rationale explaining the development of these 
subcategories is provided in the memorandum titled “Subcategorization and MACT Floor 
Determination for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines ≤500 hp at Major 
Sources” and is available from the docket.  
For the MACT floor determination, EPA reviewed the data in its Office of Air Quality 
Planning and Standards’ RICE Population Database (hereafter referred to as the “Population 
Database”) and RICE Emissions Database (hereafter referred to as the “Emissions Database”). 
The Population and Emissions Databases represent the best information available to EPA. 
Information in the Population and Emissions Database was obtained from several sources and is 
further described in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the RICE NESHAP for engines 
greater than 500 hp at major sources (67 FR 77830, December 19, 2002) and in the docket for 
the RICE NESHAP rulemaking (EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0059). EPA queried the Population 
Database to determine how many stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 hp in each 
subcategory have catalyst type controls to determine the relevant technology for the MACT 
floor. In order to establish the emission standard for each subcategory of stationary existing 
RICE, EPA referred to the Emissions Database. The following sections describe the MACT floor 
review and proposed MACT determinations for each subcategory of stationary RICE. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-17 
a. Stationary RICE <50 hp. According to the Population Database there are no existing 
stationary RICE less than 50 hp using catalyst type controls. Therefore, EPA determined that the 
MACT floor is the emission level that is achievable by existing engines of this size operating 
without add-on controls. EPA is not expecting any stationary CI engines less than 50 hp since 
such engines are typically considered nonroad mobile engines. Also, EPA does not expect any 
lean burn engines in this subcategory as lean burn engines tend to be found in larger engine size 
segments. Therefore, it is assumed that engines less than 50 hp would be 4SRB engines. 
Subsequently, EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions from 4SRB engines and averaged the best 
performing 12% without add-on controls. As a result, the MACT floor for engines below 50 hp 
is 2 parts per million by volume, dry basis (ppmvd) of formaldehyde at 15% oxygen (O2). 
EPA considered regulatory options more stringent than the MACT floor, specifically 
NSCR. However, the cost per ton of HAP reduced for engines less than 50 hp equipped with 
NSCR is high and outweighs the potential HAP reduction benefit. Therefore, MACT is 
equivalent to the MACT floor. For details on the cost per ton analysis, refer to the memorandum 
entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE,” included in the docket.  
b. Stationary Landfill/Digester Gas ≥50 hp. According to the Population Database 
there are no existing landfill or digester gas engines using catalyst type controls. Therefore, EPA 
determined that the MACT floor for this subcategory is the level achievable by existing landfill 
and digester gas engines operating without add-on controls. EPA consulted several sources, 
including the Emissions Database, in order to determine the level being achieved by landfill and 
digester gas engines.  
Based on reviewing recently obtained test reports for landfill and digester gas engines, 
EPA concluded that the latest information obtained on the current levels being achieved by 
landfill gas engines is the most appropriate and representative information and therefore was 
used to determine the MACT floor limit. EPA analyzed the CO emissions from landfill and 
digester gas test reports. EPA has previously discussed the appropriateness of using CO 
emissions as a surrogate for HAP emissions and therefore reviewed CO emissions from landfill 
and digester gas engines without add-on controls. EPA selected the best performing 12% and 
averaged those 12% to determine the MACT floor. As a result, the MACT floor for landfill and 
digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp is 177 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
Currently, there are no viable above-the-floor options for engines that combust landfill or 
digester gas. Aftertreatment controls could theoretically be applied to engines burning waste gas; 
however, numerous studies have shown that a family of silicon-based compounds named 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-18 
siloxanes can foul add-on catalyst controls. Such fouling can render the catalyst inoperable 
within short periods of time. Pre-treatment systems could be applied to clean the fuel prior to 
combustion theoretically allowing catalysts to be used, but has not shown to be a reliable 
technology at this time. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor.  
c. Stationary Emergency CI 50≥hp≤500. No existing CI emergency stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp were found to have catalyst type 
controls in the Population Database. For that reason, the MACT floor is the level achievable by 
existing CI engines operating without add-on controls. EPA reviewed CO emissions from CI 
engines without add-on controls and selected the best performing 12% without add-on controls. 
As a result, the MACT floor for CI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp 
and less than or equal to 500 hp is 40 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
As part of the analysis to consider beyond-the-floor options, EPA considered add-on 
controls for emergency engines. However, due to the limited operation of emergency engines 
(about 50 hours per year on average), the cost-effectiveness of such controls is poor. The 
estimated cost of oxidation catalyst per ton of HAP reduced ranges from $1 million to $2.8 
million for emergency CI engines in this size range. For CDPF, the estimated cost per ton of 
HAP reduced for emergency CI engines between 50 and 500 HP ranges from $3.7 million to 
$8.7 million. In addition, the total reductions achieved by applying aftertreatment controls would 
be minimal. Other relevant concerns include technical feasibility and the need for emergency 
engines to start quickly and operate without problems. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the 
MACT floor. EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the 
memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.” 
d. Stationary Non-Emergency CI 50≥hp≤500. No existing CI non-emergency 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp were found to 
have catalyst type controls, according the Population Database. For that reason, the MACT floor 
for this subcategory is the level achievable by existing CI engines operating without add-on 
controls. In terms of non-cumulative emissions, there is no difference between emissions from 
non-emergency and emergency CI engines. Therefore, the MACT floor for non-emergency CI 
engines between 50 and 500 hp engines is equivalent to the MACT floor for emergency CI 
engines between 50 and 500 hp and EPA analyzed the same data in order to determine the 
MACT floor limit. As a result, the MACT floor for CI non-emergency stationary RICE greater 
than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 40 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-19 
EPA again considered add-on controls for this subcategory of engines. The applicable 
add-on controls that yield significant HAP reductions are oxidation catalyst and CDPF. Diesel 
oxidation catalysts are capable of reducing HAP emissions by significant amounts in excess of 
90% in some cases. Diesel oxidation catalysts also reduce emissions of CO as well as PM 
emissions. Achievable reductions of PM are on the order of 30% for oxidation catalyst. 
Catalyzed diesel particulate filters are capable of reducing HAP and CO emissions by similar 
amounts, but are more efficient in reducing PM. Achievable PM reductions are on the order of 
90% or more with CDPF. However, CDPF is considerably more expensive than diesel oxidation 
catalysts. 
EPA estimated the cost per ton of HAP removal by potentially applying oxidation 
catalysts and CDPF to existing non-emergency CI engines. The specific costs associated with 
add-on controls can be found in memoranda available from the rulemaking docket. The cost per 
ton of HAP removed for CDPF is in general significantly higher than the cost per ton of HAP 
removed for oxidation catalyst, but the cost per ton for both options drastically increases as the 
size of the engine decreases and is more favorable towards larger size engines. EPA requests data 
and other information on the ability of oxidation catalysts to remove HAP compared to CDPF.  
In addition, we request comment on the performance capability of these control devices to 
remove metallic HAP.   
Considering the HAP emission reductions capable from oxidation catalysts, the cost of 
oxidation catalyst control compared to CDPF, and the low capital costs associated with oxidation 
catalyst make oxidation catalysts a favorable option for reduction of HAP emissions from larger 
existing non-emergency stationary diesel engines.  However, going above-the-floor and requiring 
oxidation catalyst on all non-emergency stationary CI engines would require significant total 
capital investment and total annual control costs. For the greater than 300 hp segment the cost 
per ton removed, which includes a mixture of organic and metallic HAP,  is estimated to be 
$51,973.  This cost is almost a third less than the estimated cost per ton of $140,395 for 
stationary engines 50 to 100 hp.  
Stationary existing diesel engines were largely uncontrolled at the Federal level prior to 
the promulgation of EPA’s emission standards for stationary diesel engines in 2004, which 
affected engines constructed beginning in 2002. Non-emergency diesel engines are estimated to 
emit 90% of total combined PM and NOx emissions from all existing stationary diesel engines, 
with emergency engines emitting the remaining 10%. Of the non-emergency diesel engines, 
about 50,000 non-emergency engines rated 300 hp or higher were built prior to 2002, which is 
about 29% of the existing population of non-emergency stationary diesel engines. These 50,000 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-20 
non-emergency diesel engines emit approximately 72% of the total HAP emissions, 66% of the 
total PM emissions, and 62% of the total NOx emissions from existing non-emergency stationary 
diesel engines. This information is based on data from the Power Systems Research Database 
that was presented in Tables 1-4 of EPA’s January 24, 2008 ANPRM for stationary diesel 
engines emission standards (73 FR 4136).  
For these reasons, EPA concluded that it can achieve the highest level of emission 
reduction relative to cost, while requiring controls where appropriate, by requiring more stringent 
emission standards on non-emergency stationary diesel engines with a power rating greater than 
300 hp. For these reasons and considering the higher level of HAP reductions achievable from 
engines greater than 300 hp and the reduced annual cost of control, EPA believes that requiring 
above-the-floor levels that rely on oxidation catalyst control is appropriate for engines greater 
than 300 hp. EPA solicits comments and data on whether 300 hp is the appropriate size division 
for setting beyond-the-floor MACT standards requiring the use of add-on controls.  Specifically, 
EPA is soliciting comment on whether it would be appropriate to extend the more stringent 
standards to engines that are less than 300 hp.   
Of further consideration are the co-benefits that would be achieved by the use of 
oxidation catalyst as it will reduce other pollutants such as CO and PM, which is of significant 
health concern. Taking into account the reductions in CO and PM associated with applying 
oxidation catalyst to non-emergency CI engines, the cost per ton of pollutants reduced if one 
sums the reductions together decreases. The total co-benefits of this proposed regulation are 
presented in a separate memorandum discussing the costs and emissions impacts of this 
regulation.  
EPA believes that the emission reductions associated with use of oxidation catalysts, 
taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified under section 112(d). Therefore, EPA 
is proposing MACT to be the level that is achieved by applying oxidation catalyst to non-
emergency CI engines greater than 300 HP, which is 4 ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2, or 90 
percent CO efficiency. A fuller discussion of EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives above-
the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for 
Stationary RICE.” 
While these proposed HAP emission standards would not require the use of CDPFs, EPA 
notes that when compared to oxidation catalysts, CDPFs provide significantly greater reductions 
in levels of PM (including black carbon) from diesel engines, which are a significant health 
concern. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-21 
EPA estimates that the range of PM2.5 emission reductions would increase from 2,600 
tons to 7,600 tons if CDPFs are used rather than oxidation catalysts.   
Black carbon emissions contribute to climate warming by absorbing incoming and 
reflected sunlight in the atmosphere and by darkening clouds, snow and ice.  The Fourth 
Assessment Report (2007) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated 
that the global mean radiative forcing (or heating) effect of black carbon ranged from roughly 10 
to 50% of the radiative forcing due to carbon dioxide (CO2). A more recent study estimates an 
even higher global mean heating effect for black carbon.3   The National Academy of Sciences 
states “Regulations targeting black carbon emissions or ozone precursors would have combined 
benefits for public health and climate.”4  While mobile diesel engines have been the largest black 
carbon source in the U.S., these emissions are expected to be reduced significantly over the next 
several decades based on CDPFs for new vehicles. EPA is interested in comments and 
information on other regulatory and non-regulatory approaches that could help address black 
carbon emissions from existing stationary diesel engines. 
Sources may wish to review whether it is appropriate for some existing CI engines to use 
CDPFs to meet the requirements of this rule, given the considerable co-benefits of using CDPF.   
For example, the cost effectiveness associated with reducing PM2.5 with oxidation catalysts on a 
300 HP diesel engine is $27,000 per ton, while using a CDPF improves the cost effectiveness to 
about $9,000 per ton.  These cost effectiveness numbers include any potential reductions of 
metallic HAP which would be emitted in the particle phase.  EPA notes, however, that some 
have suggested that the use of CDPF on older uncontrolled engines may be more problematic 
than for newer engines that already have some level of engine control. 
One of the potential problems raised by industry are the difficulties with retrofitting 
CDPFs on mechanically-controlled engines versus those that use electronic controls. 
Furthermore, the diesel PM levels from older engines are, according to some, too high for 
efficient operation of a CDPF. EPA is requesting comment on the use of CDPF to meet the HAP 
standards for this rule and on the benefits generally of using CDPFs on older stationary CI 
engines. EPA also asks for comment on technical feasibility issues that might preclude the use of 
such devices on older diesel engines.

4-22 
Stationary diesel engines also emit trace amounts of metallic HAP.  EPA believes that 
formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total HAP, including these very small trace 
emissions of metals.  Nonetheless, EPA is taking comment on whether there are more 
appropriate surrogates for metallic HAP from stationary diesel engines.  EPA does not have data 
regarding the use of other surrogates for these emissions from stationary diesel engines, so EPA 
is soliciting data on any other such surrogates. 
The proposed rule requires the use of ULSD for existing non-emergency stationary diesel 
engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder. The use of 
ULSD is necessary due to concerns about oxidation catalysts simultaneously oxidizing SO2 to 
form sulfate particulate. A limit on the diesel fuel sulfur level of 15 ppm will reduce the potential 
for increased sulfate emissions from diesel engines equipped with oxidation catalysts and will 
improve the efficiency of the catalyst. The use of ULSD will also enable stationary diesel 
engines to utilize CDPF if desired. EPA has already promulgated similar diesel fuel sulfur 
standards for highway and nonroad diesel engines and for new stationary diesel engines. 
e. Stationary Non-Emergency CI >500 hp. EPA is proposing to address emissions from 
existing non-emergency CI engines greater than 500 hp located at major sources by limiting the 
CO to 4 ppmvd at 15% O2 or by reducing CO by 90% or more. The proposed standards are based 
on what is achievable by applying oxidation catalyst. A regulation covering existing stationary 
diesel engines was promulgated in 2004. However, based on the MACT floor analysis conducted 
at that time, the regulation subjected diesel engines to emission standards of no further emission 
control. 
However, due to the availability of technically feasible and reasonably cost-effective 
technologies to control emissions from these existing large stationary CI engines , and the 
potential of reducing exhaust HAP (as well as PM), EPA is proposing to address HAP emissions 
from these existing diesel engines > 500 HP pursuant to its authority under CAA section 112(d). 
As a result of our review of the Emissions Database, the MACT floor for CI non-
emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 40 
ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of our analysis of going beyond the MACT floor, EPA considered the emissions 
associated with the use of oxidation catalysts. Similar to EPA’s analysis of the emission 
reductions and costs associated with the use of oxidation catalysts for diesel engines from 300-
500 HP, EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use of oxidation catalysts, 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-23 
taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified under section 112(d). A fuller 
discussion of EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the 
memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.”  
EPA is proposing to address emissions from existing non-emergency CI engines greater 
than 500 HP located at major sources by limiting the CO to 4 ppmvd at 15 percent O2 or by 
reducing CO by 90 percent or more. The proposed standards are based on what is achieved by 
applying oxidation catalyst controls. Oxidation catalyst controls reduce HAP, CO, and PM from 
diesel engines. The proposed emission standard is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be 
an appropriate surrogate for HAP.  Stationary diesel engines also emit trace amounts of metallic 
HAP.  EPA believes that formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total HAP, 
including these very small trace emissions of metals.  Nonetheless, EPA is taking comment on 
whether there are more appropriate surrogates for metallic HAP from stationary diesel engines.  
EPA does not have data regarding the use of other surrogates for these emissions from stationary 
diesel engines, so EPA is soliciting data on any other such surrogates. 
For the same reasons provided above for non-emergency diesel engines between 300-500 
HP, EPA is requiring the use of ULSD for non-emergency diesel engines above 500 HP.  
f. Stationary Emergency SI 50≥hp≤500. As a result of our review of the Emissions 
Database and industry estimates, EPA determined the MACT floor for SI emergency stationary 
RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 2 ppmvd of 
formaldehyde at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered add-on controls for 
this subcategory. However, the same issues apply to emergency SI engines as to emergency CI 
engines; in particular, the cost-effectiveness of such controls on emergency engines and 
questions about the feasibility of such controls on emergency engines. According to the 
Population Database there are no SI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP 
and less than or equal to 500 HP using catalyst type controls. Therefore, it is not appropriate to 
require add-on controls on emergency SI engines. EPA also found no other techniques 
appropriate to go beyond the MACT floor. MACT is therefore equivalent to the MACT floor. 
g. Stationary Non-Emergency 2SLB 50≥HP≤500. EPA selected the best performing 12 
percent of engines for formaldehyde, identified the corresponding CO tests, and averaged the CO 
emissions from the corresponding tests. As a result, the MACT floor for non-emergency 2SLB 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-24 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 85 ppmvd of 
CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst controls to this subcategory and estimated the cost per ton of HAP removed. EPA 
believes the costs to be reasonable for engines 250 HP and above equipped with oxidation 
catalyst and can be justified in light of the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved. 
Oxidation catalysts can reduce HAP and CO from stationary spark-ignition engines. The 
proposed emission limit is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be an appropriate surrogate 
for HAP. EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use of oxidation catalysts, 
taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified. Therefore, MACT for engines 250 
HP and above is the level that is achievable by applying oxidation catalyst and is 8 ppmvd of CO 
at 15 percent O2 or 90 percent CO efficiency. MACT for engines below 250 HP is equivalent to 
the MACT floor. 
g. Non-Emergency 2SLB 50≥hp≤500. According to the Population Database, there are 
no non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal 
to 249 HP using catalyst type controls.  
EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions tests from 4SLB engines. EPA selected the best 
performing 12 percent of engines for formaldehyde and identified the corresponding CO values 
from the top 12 tests for formaldehyde. The corresponding CO values were then averaged. As a 
result, the MACT floor for 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or 
equal to 249 HP is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst controls to this subcategory. However the cost per ton of HAP removed was determined 
to be too significant and to outweigh the expected HAP reductions from these stationary engines. 
Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor. 
h. Non-Emergency 4SLB 50≥hp≤249. According to the Population Database, there are 
no non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 
249 hp using catalyst type controls. Therefore, the MACT floor for this subcategory is the level 
achieved by 4SLB engines 50 to 249 hp operating without add-on controls. 
EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions tests from 4SLB engines without add-on controls. 
EPA selected the best performing 12% of engines for formaldehyde and identified the 
corresponding CO values from the top 12 tests for formaldehyde. The corresponding CO values 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-25 
were then averaged. As a result, the MACT floor for 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal 
to 50 hp and less than or equal to 249 hp is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
EPA considered applying oxidation catalyst controls to this subcategory as part of the 
beyond-the-floor analysis. However, the cost per ton of HAP removed was determined to 
outweigh the potential reductions. Therefore, MACT is the level achievable without add-on 
control and is equivalent to the MACT floor. 
i. Non-Emergency 4SLB 250≥hp≤500. For non-emergency 4SLB engines between 250 
and 500 hp, EPA found that 5.7% of the population is controlled with aftertreatment that yields 
HAP reductions. EPA analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 4SLB tests for engines without 
add-on controls. EPA took the average of the best performing 12% of engines for formaldehyde 
and identified the corresponding CO values from the best performing 12% of tests. The 
corresponding CO values were then averaged. The result for 4SLB stationary RICE greater than 
or equal to 250 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst and estimated the cost per ton of HAP removed. The use of oxidation catalysts on these 
engines can achieve 90 percent HAP reductions. EPA concluded that the control costs associated 
with installing oxidation catalysts are reasonable for this type of stationary engine, and thus can 
be justified considering the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved by using 
oxidation catalysts. Oxidation catalysts can reduce HAP and CO from stationary spark-ignition 
engines. The proposed emission limit is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be an 
appropriate surrogate for HAP. EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use 
of oxidation catalysts, taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified.  
EPA determined that the appropriate numerical MACT level could be determined by 
analyzing uncontrolled levels of HAP and reducing the levels by the expected reductions from 
oxidation catalysts. EPA analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 4SLB tests for engines without 
add-on controls. EPA took the average of the best performing 12 percent of engines for 
formaldehyde and identified the corresponding CO values from the best performing 12 percent 
of tests. The corresponding CO values were then averaged. The result for 4SLB stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 250 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15 
percent O2. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-26 
Given an expected 90 percent reduction from the use of oxidation catalysts, MACT is 9 
ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2 or 90 percent CO efficiency. A fuller discussion of EPA’s 
analysis of regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled 
“Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.” 
j. Non-Emergency 4SRB 50≥hp≤500. For SI non-emergency stationary 4SRB engines 
greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp, EPA found that 5.6% of the 
population are using catalyst type controls, according to the Population Database. EPA 
determined that the appropriate numerical MACT level could be determined by analyzing 
uncontrolled levels of HAP and reducing the levels by the expected reductions from NSCR. EPA 
analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 4SRB engines without add-on controls and averaged the 
emissions from the best performing 12% of engines. The result for 4SRB stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 2 ppmvd of formaldehyde at 
15% O2. 
The add-on controls that apply to this subcategory of engines is NSCR. As part of the 
beyond-the-floor analysis, EPA considered the application of NSCR to this engine subcategory. 
The technology is proven, has been applied to thousands of rich burn engines, and is efficient at 
reducing HAP emissions. EPA considered applying NSCR and estimated the cost per ton of 
HAP removed. EPA believes the costs are reasonable and appropriate and can be justified 
considering the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved by using NSCR on this 
subcategory of engines. Other pollutants are also reduced through the use of NSCR including 
significant reductions in NOx and CO emissions. Taking into consideration the emission 
reductions achieved by applying NSCR to 4SRB engines greater than 50 hp, the cost per ton of 
emissions reduced is favorable. A fuller discussion of EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives 
above-the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for 
Stationary RICE.” 
Therefore, MACT is the level that is achievable by applying NSCR and is 200 ppbvd of 
formaldehyde at 15% O2 or 90% formaldehyde efficiency.  
4.4 Engines at Area Sources  
Under section 112(k) of the CAA, EPA developed a national strategy to address air toxic 
pollution from area sources. The strategy is part of EPA’s overall national effort to reduce toxics, 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-27 
but focuses on the particular needs of urban areas. Section 112(k) requires EPA to list area 
source categories and to ensure 90% of the emissions from area sources are subject to standards 
pursuant to section 112(d) of the CAA. Under section 112(k), the CAA specifically mandated 
that EPA develop a strategy to address public health risks posed by air toxics from area sources 
in urban areas. Section 112(k) also mandates that the strategy achieve a 75% reduction in cancer 
incidence attributable to HAP emitted by stationary sources. As mentioned, stationary RICE are 
listed as a source category under the Urban Air Toxics Strategy developed under the authority of 
sections 112(k) and 112(c)(3) of the CAA. These area sources are subject to standards under 
section 112(d).  
Section 112(d)(5) of the CAA indicates that EPA may elect to promulgate standards or 
requirements to area sources “which provide for the use of generally available control 
technologies or management practices by such sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air 
pollutants.” For determining emission limitations, GACT standards can be more flexible 
requirements than MACT standards. For example, the CAA provisions for setting GACT do not 
require to set a control baseline or “floor” that is equal to the average emission levels achieved 
by the best performing 12% of a type of facility, for existing sources, or the emission control 
achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, for new sources. EPA is permitted to 
consider costs and other factors during each phase of the GACT analysis. Control technology 
options available to stationary RICE located at area sources are the same as those discussed for 
engines located at major sources. 
The requirements being proposed in this action are applicable to stationary RICE located 
at area sources of HAP emissions. EPA has chosen to propose national requirements, which not 
only focus on urban areas, but address emissions from area sources in all areas (urban and rural). 
For stationary RICE, it would not be practical or appropriate to limit the applicability to 
urban areas and EPA has determined that national standards are appropriate. Stationary RICE are 
located in both urban and rural areas. In fact, there are some rural areas with high concentrations 
of stationary RICE. Stationary RICE are employed in various industries used for both the private 
and public sector for a wide range of applications such as generator sets, irrigation sets, air and 
gas compressors, pumps, welders, and hydro power units. Stationary RICE may be used by 
private entities for agricultural purposes and be located in a rural area, or it may be used as a 
standby generator for an office building located in an urban area. Other stationary RICE may 
operate at large sources for electric power generation, transmission, or distribution purposes. 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-28 
In previous rulemakings, EPA had determined that stationary RICE are located all over 
the U.S., and EPA cannot say that these sources are more prevalent in certain areas of the 
country. Therefore, for the source category of stationary RICE, EPA is proposing national 
requirements without a distinction between urban and non-urban areas.  
For subcategories of larger engines, particularly those above 500 hp and those for which 
EPA has based MACT on the use of add-on controls, the proposed GACT requirement for area 
sources is equal to MACT for similar engines at major sources. The control technologies that 
create the basis for the emission standards for engines located at major sources are readily 
available and feasible for all engines. Further, for those cases where EPA is basing the MACT 
emission standards on add-on controls, EPA determined that costs associated with implementing 
HAP-reducing technologies are reasonable and justified. Hence, there is no reason why GACT 
should be any different than MACT for larger engines located at area sources. Consequently, 
EPA has determined that for area sources that are non-emergency 2SLB engines greater than or 
equal to 250 hp, non-emergency 4SLB engines greater than or equal to 250 hp, non-emergency 
4SRB greater than or equal to 50 hp, emergency CI engines greater than 500 hp, non-emergency 
CI engines greater than 300 hp, landfill and digester gas engines greater than 500 hp, and 
emergency SI engines greater than 500 hp, GACT is equal to MACT. 
As discussed, GACT provides EPA more flexibility in setting requirements than MACT 
and can include available control technologies or management practices to reduce HAP 
emissions. EPA has determined that for area sources that are non-emergency 2SLB engines 
greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, non-emergency 4SLB engines greater than or 
equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, emergency CI engines greater than or equal to 50 hp and 
less than or equal to 500 hp, non-emergency CI engines greater than or equal to 50 hp and less 
than or equal to 300 hp, engines less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas engines greater than or 
equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp, and emergency SI engines greater than or equal 
to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp, EPA proposes that GACT is management practices.  
Management practices include requiring owners and operators to operate and maintain 
their stationary RICE and aftertreatment control device (if any) according to the manufacturer’s 
emission-related written instructions. Alternatively, owners and operators may develop their own 
maintenance plans to follow. Owners and operators using such maintenance plans must, to the 
extent practicable, maintain and operate the engine in a manner consistent with good air 
pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Add-on controls are feasible for some 
engines located at area sources, but control costs are high and EPA believes that it is possible to 
achieve reasonable controls using management practices. EPA is also attempting to minimize the 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-29 
burden of the proposed rule, specifically on small businesses and individual owners and 
operators. EPA does not believe that management practices would be a substantial burden on 
owners and operators such as private owners and small entities. Therefore, EPA is proposing 
management practices for smaller engines located at area sources, particularly those where the 
MACT standard was not determined to be based on add-on technology.  
4.4.3 How Did EPA Determine the Compliance Requirements? 
EPA discussed the specific compliance requirements that are being proposed earlier in 
this chapter. In general, EPA has attempted to reduce the burden on affected owners and 
operators. The following presents the rationale for the proposed compliance requirements. 
Stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are less than 100 hp, 
stationary RICE located at area sources that are not subject to numerical emission standards, and 
all stationary emergency RICE are only subject to minimal compliance requirements in the form 
of management practices to minimize emissions and are not subject to performance testing. EPA 
does not believe that following the manufacturer’s instructions is a burdensome requirement, and 
it is expected that most owners and operators are already doing so. It is in the owner’s best 
interest to operate and maintain the engine and aftertreatment device (if one is installed) 
properly. This proposed requirement minimizes the burden on individual owners and operators 
and small entities, while ensuring that the engine and aftertreatment device is operated and 
maintained correctly. Further, EPA does not believe that it is reasonable to subject small 
stationary RICE and stationary emergency RICE to performance testing. Subjecting the engines 
to maintenance requirements will assist in minimizing and maintaining emissions below the 
emission standards. The cost of requiring performance testing on these engines would be too 
significant when compared to the cost of the unit itself and to the benefits of such testing. 
Subjecting stationary RICE located at area sources that are not subject to numerical emission 
standards to performance testing would not serve a meaningful purpose. 
For stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are greater than or 
equal to 100 hp and stationary RICE located at area sources that are subject to numerical 
emission standards, EPA determined that performance testing is necessary to confirm that the 
emission standards are being met. Again, EPA has attempted to reduce compliance requirements 
and is proposing a level of performance testing commensurate with ensuring that the emission 
standards are being met. Therefore, for non-emergency stationary RICE located at major sources 
that are greater than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp and stationary RICE 
located at area sources that are subject to numerical emission standards, EPA chose to require an 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-30 
initial performance test only. However, if the engine is rebuilt or overhauled, the engine must be 
re-tested to demonstrate that it meets the emission standards. 
For non-emergency stationary RICE greater than 500 hp, testing every 8,760 hours of 
operation of 3 years, whichever comes first, is also required. EPA believes such a requirement is 
appropriate for these size engines, but does not believe that further testing is necessary for 
smaller engines, i.e., those less than or equal to 500 hp. Subsequent performance testing is 
appropriate for engines greater than 500 hp due to their size and frequency of operation. Plus, 
many States mandate more stringent compliance requirements for large engines. Finally, the 
RICE NESHAP for engines greater than 500 hp located at major sources also required further 
performance testing following the initial compliance demonstration. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE 
that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source, and stationary non-emergency CI 
RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at a major source must continuously monitor 
pressure drop across the catalyst and catalyst inlet temperature if the engine is equipped with 
oxidation catalyst or NSCR. These parameters serve as surrogates of the catalyst performance. 
The pressure drop across the catalyst can indicate if the catalyst is damaged or fouled, in which 
case, catalyst performance would decrease. If the pressure drop across the catalyst deviates by 
more than two inches of water from the pressure drop across the catalyst measured during the 
initial performance test, the catalyst might be damaged or fouled. If the catalyst is changed, the 
pressure drop across the catalyst must be reestablished. The catalyst inlet temperature is a 
requirement for proper performance of the catalyst. In general, the catalyst performance will 
decrease as the catalyst inlet temperature decreases. In addition, if the catalyst inlet temperature 
is too high, it might be an indication of ignition misfiring, poisoning, or fouling, which would 
decrease catalyst performance. In addition, the catalyst requires inlet temperatures to be greater 
than or equal to the specified temperature for the reduction of HAP emissions. 
4.4.4 How Did EPA Determine the Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements? 
EPA discussed the specific reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are being 
proposed earlier in this report. In general, EPA has attempted to reduce the reporting and 
recordkeeping burden on affected owners and operators. The following presents the rationale for 
the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  
Owners and operators of emergency engines are required to keep records of their hours of 
operation (emergency and non-emergency). Owners and operators must install a non-resettable 
hour meter on their engines to record the necessary information. The owner and operators are 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-31 
required to record the time of operation and the reason the engine was in operation during that 
time. EPA believes these requirements are appropriate for emergency engines. The requirement 
to maintain records documenting why the engine was operating will ensure that regulatory 
agencies have the necessary information to determine if the engine was in compliance with the 
maintenance and testing hour limitation of 100 hours per year. 
EPA does not believe the recordkeeping requirements being placed upon owners and 
operators of stationary emergency engines are onerous. Emergency engines are often equipped 
with the equipment necessary to record hours of operation and operators may already be 
recording the information. Even as a brand new requirement, recording the time and reason of 
operation should take minimal time and effort. Further, recording the hours and reason for 
operation is necessary to assure that the engine is in compliance. Finally, these requirements are 
consistent with previously promulgated requirements affecting the same or similar engines, 
namely under the CI and SI NSPS. 
The reporting requirements being proposed in this rule are consistent with those required 
for engines subject to the 2004 rule, i.e., stationary RICE greater than 500 hp located at major 
sources and are based on the General Provisions. Owners and operators of existing emergency 
stationary RICE, existing stationary RICE that are less than 100 hp and existing stationary RICE 
that are not subject to any numerical emission standards, do not have to submit the notifications 
listed in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A). Owners and operators of 
all other engines must submit an initial notification, notification of performance test, and a 
notification of compliance for each stationary RICE which must comply with the specified 
emission limitations.  
4.5 How Cost Estimates Are Derived 
4.5.3 Introduction 
The cost impacts associated with the proposed rule consist of different types of costs, 
which include the annual and capital costs of controls, costs associated with keeping records of 
information necessary to demonstrate compliance, costs associated with reporting requirements 
under the General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, costs of purchasing and operating 
equipment associated with continuous parametric monitoring, and the cost of conducting 
performance testing to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards. The costs presented 
in this section are calculated based on the control cost methodology presented in the EPA (2002) 
Air Pollution Control Cost Manual prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.5 This

OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
4-32 
methodology sets out a procedure by which capital and annualized costs are defined and 
estimated, and this procedure is often used to estimate the costs of rulemakings such as this one. 
The capital costs presented in this section are annualized using a 7% interest rate, a rate that is 
consistent with the guidance provided in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) 
(2003) Circular A-4.6 The following sections describe how the various cost elements were 
estimated.  
4.5.3.5 Control Costs 
For engines that will need to add control technology to meet the emission standards, the 
following equations were used to estimate capital and annual control costs: 
Cost Equations for RICE Add-on Control Technologies  
Technology Capital Cost Annual Cost 
NSCR $19.7 x hp + $1,799 $2.65 x hp + $657 
Oxidation catalyst $11.3 x hp - $170 $1.52 x hp + $393 
 
The control costs were obtained from a memorandum of information developed for 
previous engine rulemakings and is available from Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0030.7  
4.5.3.6 Recordkeeping 
No costs were attributed to the requirement of following the manufacturer’s emission-
related operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements or the owner or operator’s own 
maintenance plan. It is expected that the majority of owners and operators are already following 
some type of O&M requirements and minimal to no additional burden is expected. Costs 
associated with recording the hours of operation of emergency engines are based on labor rates 
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site (http://www.bls.gov/news.release 
/ecec.toc.htm) and is $68 per hour for technical labor. The final total wage rate was based on the 
2005 compensation rates for professional staff and adjusted by an overhead and profit rate of 
167%. The year 2005 was used for consistency in order to have the same basis for all costs. All 
costs were later converted to 2007 dollars for purposes of presenting costs associated with the 
rule in present day terms. One hour per year is expected to be sufficient to records hours of

operating for stationary emergency engines. No cost is attributed to purchasing and installing an 
hour-meter since most stationary engines already come equipped with such equipment.  
4.5.3.7 Reporting 
Most engines affected by this rule will be subject to reporting requirements such as 
reading instructions, training personnel, submitting an initial notification, submitting a 
notification of performance test(s), and submitting a compliance report. Owners and operators of 
engines less than 100 hp, emergency engines, and engines that are not subject to any numerical 
emission standards (e.g., 2SLB less than or equal to 249 hp located at area sources) are not 
subject to any reporting requirements. The reporting requirements are based on $68 per hour for 
technical labor to comply with the reporting requirements. It is estimated that a total of 14 hours 
will be needed. 
4.5.3.8 Monitoring 
The cost of monitoring includes the purchase of a continuous parametric monitoring 
system (CPMS). Non-emergency engines greater than 500 hp that have add-on controls are 
required to use a CPMS to monitor the catalyst inlet temperature and pressure drop across the 
catalyst to ensure those parameters do not exceed the operating limitations. The cost of 
purchasing and operating a CPMS was obtained from vendor quotes received for previous 
rulemaking and adjusted to 2007 dollars.8 The capital cost of a CPMS for a large engine facility 
is $531. It is estimated that 30 hours per year is necessary to operate and maintain the CPMS and 
that 6 hours per year (or 0.5 hours per month) is needed to record information from the CPMS. It 
is assumed that all engines subject to continuous monitoring would be located at large engine 
facilities.  
4.5.3.9 Performance Testing 
The cost of conducting performance testing is based on the cost of portable analyzer 
testing and is $1,000 per engine. Since in most cases only an initial performance test is required, 
it is expected that a testing firm will be conducting the performance test. The cost of testing is 
based on testing two engines where facilities have engines less than 500 hp for a reduction in 
cost of testing per engine. The testing cost is based on testing three engines where facilities have 
engines larger than 500 hp. The testing costs are based on information previously obtained from

engine testing firms9 and recently obtained information summarized in the memorandum 
“Portable Analyzer Testing Costs.” 
Summary of Cost Impacts. A summary of the total capital and annualized costs 
associated with the rule and a breakdown of the costs by NAICS codes are presented in Tables 4-
4 through 4-7. Costs are presented by type of cost (i.e., control device, or administrative), 
industry, and engine size category, and they are also listed with the number of affected engines 
by size category. All of these estimates are taken from the memo “Impacts Associated with 
NESHAP for Existing Stationary RICE” that is found in the docket for this rulemaking.  
The total national capital cost for the proposed rule is estimated to be $528 million, and 
the total national annualized cost is $345 million (2007 dollars). The total national capital costs 
for area sources are about four times higher than those for major sources, and the total national 
annualized costs for area sources are about twice that for major sources. The electric power 
generation and natural gas transmission industries are each expected to receive 43% of the 
capital costs and 44 and 33% of the annualized costs, respectively.  
Summary of Emission Reductions. The proposed rule is expected to reduce total HAP 
emissions from stationary RICE by approximately 13,000 tons per year (tpy) beginning in the 
year 2013 or the first year the rule will become effective. EPA estimates that approximately 
290,000 stationary SI engines will be subject to the rule and nearly 1 million stationary CI 
engines will be subject to the rule. These estimates include stationary engines located at major 
and area sources; however, not all stationary engines are subject to numerical emission 
standards. Further information regarding the estimated reductions of the proposed rule can be 
found in the memorandum entitled “Impacts Associated with NESHAP for Existing Stationary 
RICE,” which is available in the docket. 
In addition to HAP emissions reductions, the proposed rule will reduce other pollutants 
such as CO, NOx, PM, SOx, and VOC. The proposed rule is expected to reduce emissions of CO 
by more than 511,000 tpy in the year 2013. Emissions of NOx are expected to be reduced by 
79,000 tpy in the year 2013. Reductions of PM are estimated at close to 2,600 tpy in the year 
2013, and all of the PM is in the PM2.5 fraction. SOx reductions are expected to be more than 
4,600 tpy in the year 2013. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are estimated to be 
reduced by 90,000 tpy in the year 2013. Table 4-8 provides a listing of these pollutant 
reductions.

4.6 Baseline Emissions and Emission Reductions 
  Tables 4-8 through 4-10 present the baseline emissions by pollutant, engine type (CI and 
SI, non-emergency and emergency), and engine size.  Tables 4-8 and 4-9 present this 
information for the CI engines; Table 4-10 presents this information for the SI engines.  As 
shown in these tables, there are no emission reductions from emergency CI engines.  Table 4-
11 presents the emission reductions by pollutant, engine type and engine size, and Table 4-12 
presents a summary of the emission reductions across all pollutants, engine types and sizes.   
All emission estimates are for the year in which full implementation of this proposal is 
required (2013).    More information on these emissions, emission reductions, and how these 
estimates are generated can be found in the memo “Impacts Associated with NESHAP for 
Existing Stationary RICE” that is available in the public docket for this rulemaking.

SECTION 5  
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS, ENERGY IMPACTS, AND SOCIAL COSTS 
The EIA provides decision makers with social cost estimates and enhances understanding 
of how the costs may be distributed across stakeholders (EPA, 2000). Although several 
economic frameworks can be used to estimate social costs for regulations of this size and sector 
scope, OAQPS has typically used partial equilibrium market models. However, the current data 
do not provide sufficient details to develop a market model; the data that are available have little 
or no sector/firm detail and are reported at the national level. In addition, some sectors have 
unique market characteristics (e.g., hospitals) that make developing partial equilibrium models 
difficult. Given these constraints, we used the direct compliance costs as a measure of total social 
costs. In addition, we also provide a qualitative analysis of the proposed rule’s impact on 
stakeholder decisions, a qualitative discussion on if unfunded mandates occur as a result of this 
proposed rule, and the potential distribution of social costs between consumers and producers. 
5.1 Compliance Costs of the Proposed Rule 
For the year 2013, EPA’s engineering cost analysis estimates the total annualized costs of 
the proposed rule are $345 million (in 2007 dollars) (Nelson and Paries, 2008).  
As shown in Figure 5-1, the majority of the costs fall on the electric power sector (46%), 
followed by the natural gas transmission sector (31%). The remaining industries each account for 
less than 10% of the total annualized cost.  
The proposed rule will affect approximately 1.3 million existing stationary diesel 
engines. As shown in Figure 5-2, most of the affected engines fall within the 100 to 175 hp 
category (31%). The next highest categories are 50 to 100 hp (23%) and 175 to 300 hp (21%). 
The remaining engines are concentrated in the 300 to 600 hp category (16%). 
The annualized compliance costs per engine vary by the engine size (see Figure 5-3). For 
300 hp engines or less, the annualized per-engine costs are below $200 per engine. Per-engine 
costs for higher horsepower (hp) engines range between $600 and $1,600.

Figure 5-3. Average Annualized Cost per Engine by Horsepower Group: 2013 ($2007)  
 
To assess the size of the compliance relative to the value of the goods and services for 
industries using affected engines, we collected census data for selected industries. At the industry 
level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.7%) (Table 
5-1). These industry level cost-to-sales ratios can be interpreted as an average impact on 
potentially affected firms in these industries. Based on the cost-to-sales ratios, we can conclude 
that the annualized cost of this rule should be no higher than 1% of the sales for a firm in each of 
these industries. 
5.2 How Might People and Firms Respond? A Partial Equilibrium Analysis 
Markets are composed of people as consumers and producers trying to do the best they 
can given their economic circumstances. One way economists illustrate behavioral responses to 
pollution control costs is by using market supply and demand diagrams. The market supply curve 
describes how much of a good or service firms are willing and able to sell to people at a 
particular price; we often draw this curve as upward sloping because some production resources 
are fixed. As a result, the cost of producing an additional unit typically rises as more units are 
made. The market demand curve describes how much of a good or service consumers are willing

and able to buy at some price. Holding other factors constant, the quantity demand is assumed to 
fall when prices rise. In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium price (P0) and quantity (Q0) 
is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves (see Figure 5-4). 
5.2.1 Changes in Market Prices and Quantities  
To qualitatively assess how the regulation may influence the equilibrium price and 
quantity in the affected markets, we assumed the market supply function shifts up by the 
additional cost of producing the good or service; the unit cost increase is typically calculated by 
dividing the annual compliance cost estimate by the baseline quantity (Q0) (see Figure 5-4). As 
shown, this model makes two predictions: the price of the affected goods and services are likely 
to rise and the consumption/production levels are likely to fall.

consumer surplus = –[fghd + dhc] 
producer surplus = [fghd – aehb] – bdc 
total surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus =  
–[aehb + dhc + bdc] 
Figure 5-4. Market Demand and Supply Model: With and Without Regulation 
 
The size of these changes depends on two factors: the size of the unit cost increase 
(supply shift) and differences in how each side of the market (supply and demand) responds to 
changes in price. Economists measure responses using the concept of price elasticity, which 
represents the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. This 
dependence has been expressed in the following formula:1 
( )Demand) of Elasticity Price -Supply  of Elasticity Price
Supply of Elasticity Pricecost  uniter-Share of p =  
 
As a general rule, a higher share of the per-unit cost increases will be passed on to 
consumers in markets where  
 goods and services are necessities and people do not have good substitutes that they 
can switch to easily (demand is inelastic) and

447, or Fullerton and Metcalf (2002).

 suppliers have excess capacity and can easily adjust production levels at minimal 
costs, or the time period of analysis is long enough that suppliers can change their 
fixed resources; supply is more elastic over longer periods.  
Short-run demand elasticities for energy goods (electricity and natural gas), agricultural 
products, and construction are often inelastic. Specific estimates of short-run demand elasticities 
for these products can be obtained from existing literature. For the short-run demand of energy 
products, the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) buildings module uses values between 
0.1 and 0.3; a 1% increase in price leads to a 0.1 to 0.3% decrease in energy demand (Wade, 
2003). For the short-run demand of agriculture and construction, the EPA has estimated 
elasticities to be 0.2 for agriculture and approximately 1 for construction (EPA, 2004). As a 
result, a 1% increase in the prices of agriculture products would lead to a 0.2% decrease in 
demand for those products, while a 1% increase in construction prices would lead to 
approximately a 1% decrease in demand for construction. Given these demand elasticity 
scenarios (shaded in gray), approximately a 1% increase unit costs would result in a price 
increase of 0.1 to 1% (Table 5-2). As a result, 10 to 100% of the unit cost increase could be 
passed on to consumers in the form of higher goods/services prices. This price increase would 
correspond to a 0.1 to 0.8% decline in consumption in these markets (Table 5-3).

5.2.2 Regulated Markets: The Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and 
Distribution Sector 
Given that the electric power sector bears close to half of the estimated compliance costs 
(Figure 5-1) and the industry is also among the last major regulated energy industries in the 
United States (EIA, 2000), the competitive model is not necessarily applicable for this industry.

Although the electricity industry continues to go through a process of restructuring, whereby the 
industry is moving toward a more competitive framework (see Figure 5-5 for the status of 
restructuring by state),2 in many states, electricity prices continue to be fully regulated by Public 
Service Commissions. As a result, the rules and processes outlined by these agencies would 
ultimately determine how these additional regulatory costs would be recovered by affected 
entities. 
5.2.3 Partial Equilibrium Measures of Social Cost: Changes Consumer and Producer 
Surplus  
In partial equilibrium analysis, the social costs are estimated by measuring the changes in 
consumer and producer surplus, and these values can be determined using the market supply and 
demand model (Figure 5-4). The change in consumer surplus is measured as follows: 
 )CS = – [)Q1 × )p] + [0.5 × )Q × )p]. (5.1) 
Higher market prices and lower quantities lead to consumer welfare losses. Similarly, the change 
in producer surplus is measured as follows: 
 )PS = [)Q1 × )p] – [)Q1 × t] – [0.5 × )Q × ()p – t)]. (5.2) 
Higher unit costs and lower production level reduce producer surplus because the net price 
change ()p – t) is negative. However, these losses are mitigated because market prices tend to 
rise.

5.3 Social Cost Estimate 
Differences between social cost estimates derived from a perfect competition partial 
equilibrium models and engineering direct compliance cost methods are likely to be small. As 
shown in Table 5-1 the compliance costs are only a small fraction of the affected product value; 
this suggests that shift of the supply curve may also be small and result in small changes in 
market prices and consumption. As a result, EPA believes the national annualized compliance 
cost estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the social cost of this proposed rule. 
5.4 Energy Impacts 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) provides that agencies will prepare 
and submit to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, a Statement of Energy Effects for certain actions identified as 
“significant energy actions.” Section 4(b) of Executive Order 13211 defines “significant energy 
actions” as any action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including 
notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking: 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
 5-9
(1) (i) that is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order, 
and (ii) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; 
or (2) that is designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
as a significant energy action. 
This rule is not a significant energy action as designated by the Administrator of the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs because it is not likely to have a significant adverse 
impact on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. EPA has prepared an analysis of energy 
impacts that explains this conclusion as follows below. 
With respect to energy supply and prices, the analysis in Table 5-1 suggests at the 
industry level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.7%). 
As a result, we can conclude supply and price impacts should be small.  
To enhance understanding regarding the regulation’s influence on energy consumption, 
we examined publicly available data describing energy consumption for the electric power sector 
that will be affected by this rule. The Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (EIA, 2008) provides energy 
consumption data. As shown in Table 5-4, this industry account for less than 0.5% of the U.S. 
total liquid fuels and less than 6.5% of natural gas. As a result, any energy consumption changes 
attributable to the regulatory program should not significantly influence the supply, distribution, 
or use of energy. 
5.5 Unfunded Mandates 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, 
requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their 
regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. This rule 
contains a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. 
Accordingly, EPA has prepared under section 202 of the UMRA a written statement which is 
summarized below in this section.

5.5.1 Statutory Authority 
As discussed previously in this RIA the statutory authority for the proposed rule is 
section 112 of the CAA. Section 112(b) lists the 189 chemicals, compounds, or groups of 
chemicals deemed by Congress to be HAP. These toxic air pollutants are to be regulated by 
NESHAP. Section 112(d) of the CAA directs us to develop NESHAP based on MACT, which 
require existing and new major sources to control emissions of HAP. These NESHAP apply to 
existing stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 HP located at major sources of HAP 
emissions, existing non-emergency stationary CI RICE greater than 300 HP, and existing 
stationary RICE located at area sources of HAP emissions, however, only certain existing 
stationary RICE have substantive regulatory requirements. EPA promulgated NESHAP for 
existing, new, and reconstructed stationary RICE greater than 500 HP located at major sources 
on June 15, 2004 (69 FR 33474). EPA promulgated NESHAP for new and reconstructed 
stationary RICE that are located at area sources of HAP emissions and for new and reconstructed 
stationary RICE that have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 HP that are located at major 
sources of HAP emissions on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 3568). EPA is required to address HAP 
emissions from stationary RICE located at area sources under section 112(k) of the CAA.

In compliance with section 205(a), we identified and considered a reasonable number of 
regulatory alternatives that are shown and discussed in Chapter 4 of this RIA. The regulatory 
alternative upon which the rule is based represents the MACT floor for stationary RICE less than 
or equal to 500 HP located at major sources and GACT for stationary RICE located at area 
sources and, as a result, it is the least costly and least burdensome alternative. 
5.5.2 Social Costs and Benefits 
The Agency’s assessment of costs and benefits is detailed in this RIA. Based on 
estimated compliance costs on all sources associated with the proposed rule and the predicted 
change in prices and production in the affected industries, the estimated social costs of the 
proposed rule are $345 million (2007 dollars). It is estimated that by 2013, HAP will be reduced 
by 13,000 tpy due to reductions in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, methanol and other 
HAP from existing stationary RICE. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have been classified as 
“probable human carcinogens.” Acrolein, methanol and the other HAP are not considered 
carcinogenic, but produce several other toxic effects. The proposed rule will also achieve 
reductions in 511,000 tons of CO, approximately 79,000 tons of NOx per year, about 90,000 tons 
of VOC per year, and approximately 2,600 tons of PM per year, in the year 2013. Exposure to 
CO can affect the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system. Emissions of NOx can 
transform into PM, which can result in fatalities and many respiratory problems (such as asthma 
or bronchitis); and NOx can also transform into ozone causing several respiratory problems to 
affected populations.  
The total monetized benefits of the proposed rule, as will be shown in more detail in 
Chapter 7, range from $0.9 to $2.0 billion (2007 dollars). The monetized benefits are comprised 
primarily of the benefits from reductions in directly emitted PM2.5 and PM2.5 created from 
transformation of NOx and SO2. We cannot provide a monetary estimate for the benefits 
associated with reductions of HAP and CO due to a lack of scientific knowledge of the links 
between the reductions in incidence of the health and environmental effects listed and a value 
that can be placed on them. EPA currently has research going on to provide such monetized 
estimates. We are also unable to quantify and monetize all categories of benefits of NOx 
reductions (ecosystem and environmental effects), and to monetize reduction in premature 
mortalities associated with ozone reductions. The methodology for estimating monetized benefits 
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 of the RIA.

5.5.3 Future and Disproportionate Costs 
The UMRA requires that we estimate, where accurate estimation is reasonably feasible, 
future compliance costs imposed by the rule and any disproportionate budgetary effects. Our 
estimates of the future compliance costs of the proposed rule are discussed previously in Chapter 
4 of this RIA. We do not believe that there will be any disproportionate budgetary effects of the 
proposed rule on any particular areas of the country, State or local governments, types of 
communities (e.g., urban, rural), or particular industry segments.  
5.5.4 Effects on the National Economy 
 The UMRA requires that we estimate the effect of the proposed rule on the 
national economy. To the extent feasible, we must estimate the effect on productivity, economic 
growth, full employment, creation of productive jobs, and international competitiveness of the 
U.S. goods and services if we determine that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible and that 
such effect is relevant and material. The nationwide economic impact of the proposed rule is 
presented earlier in this RIA chapter. This analysis provides estimates of the effect of the 
proposed rule on most of the categories mentioned above, and these estimates are presented 
earlier in this RIA chapter. In addition, we have determined that the proposed rule contains no 
regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. 
Therefore, today’s rule is not subject to the requirements of section 203 of the UMRA.

SECTION 6  
SMALL ENTITY SCREENING ANALYSIS 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act as amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit enterprises. 
After considering the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, the 
screening analysis indicates that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities (or “SISNOSE”).  
6.1  Small Entity Data Set 
The industry sectors covered by the proposed rule were identified during the development 
of the cost analysis (Nelson and Parise, 2008). The SUSB provides national information on the 
distribution of economic variables by industry and enterprise size (U.S. Census, 2008a, b).1 The 
Census Bureau and the Office of Advocacy of the SBA supported and developed these files for 
use in a broad range of economic analyses.2 Statistics include the total number of establishments 
and receipts for all entities in an industry; however, many of these entities may not necessarily be 
covered by the proposed rule. SUSB also provides statistics by enterprise employment and 
receipt size.  
The Census Bureau’s definitions used in the SUSB are as follows: 
 Establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 
conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.  
 Receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes.  
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
                                                 
1The SUSB data do not provide establishment information for the national security NAICS code (92811) or irrigated 
farms. Since most national security installations are owned by the federal government (e.g., military bases), EPA 
assumes these entities would not be considered small. For irrigated farms, we relied on receipt data provided in 
the 2003 Farm and Irrigation Survey (USDA, 2004).

OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009

enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008) apply to an establishment’s 
“ultimate parent company,” we assumed in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is 
consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for SBREFA 
screening analyses and the terms are used interchangeably.  
6.1 Small Entity Economic Impact Measures 
The analysis generated a set of establishment sales tests (represented as cost-to-receipt 
ratios)3 for NAICS codes associated with sectors listed in Table 6-1. Although the appropriate 
SBA size definition should be applied at the parent company (enterprise) level, we can only 
compute and compare ratios for a model establishment owned by an enterprise within an SUSB 
size range (employment or receipts). Using the SUSB size range helps us account for receipt 
differences between establishments owned by large and small enterprises and also allows us to 
consider the variation in small business definitions across affected industries. Using 
establishment receipts is also a conservative approach, because an establishment’s parent 
company (the “enterprise”) may have other economic resources that could be used to cover the 
costs of the proposed rule. 
6.1.1 Model Establishment Receipts and Annual Compliance Costs 
The sales test compares a representative establishment’s total annual engine costs to the 
average establishment receipts for enterprises in several size categories.4 For industries with SBA 
employment size standards, we calculated average establishment receipts for each enterprise 
employment range (Table 6-2). For industries with SBA receipt size standards, we  
                                                 
3The following metrics for other small entity economic impact measures (if applicable) would potentially include 
• small governments (if applicable): “revenue” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
government revenues and 
• small nonprofits (if applicable): “expenditure” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
operating expenses, 
4For the 1 to 20 employee category, we excluded SUSB data for enterprises with zero employees. These enterprises 
did not operate the entire year.

(NAICS 111 and 112) also have an SBA receipt size standard that defines a small business as 
receiving $750,000 or less in receipts per year. However, SUSB data were not available for these 
industries. Therefore, we conducted the sales test using the following range of establishment 
receipts: farms with annual receipts of $25,000 or less, farms with annual receipts of $100,000 or 
less, farms with annual receipts of $500,000 or less, and farms with annual receipts of $750,000 
or less.

Annual entity compliance costs vary depending on the size of the diesel engines used at 
the affected establishment. Absent facility-specific information, we computed per-entity 
compliance costs based for three different cases based on representative establishments—Cases 
1, 2, and 3 (see Table 6-4). Each representative establishment differs based on the size and 
number of diesel engines being used. Compliance costs are calculated by summing the total 
annualized compliance costs for the relevant engine categories, dividing the sum by the total 
existing population of those engines, and multiplying the average engine cost by the number of 
engines assumed to be at the establishment. Since NAICS 2211, 48621, and 622110 are 
fundamentally different than other industries considered in this analysis, we used different 
assumptions about what constitutes the representative establishment and report these 
assumptions separately.  
 Case 1: The representative establishment for all industries uses three 750+ hp engines 
with an average compliance cost of $1,603 per engine, resulting in a total annualized 
compliance cost of approximately $4,810 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 2: The representative establishment in NACIS 2211, 48621, and 622110 uses 
two 50 to 750+ hp engines with an average compliance cost of $352 per engine, 
resulting in a total annualized compliance cost of $704 for this representative 
establishment. For all other industries, the representative establishment uses two 50 to 
300 hp engines with an average compliance cost of $141 per engine, resulting in a 
total compliance cost of $281 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 3: The representative establishment for all industries uses two 50 to 100 hp 
engines with an average compliance cost of $58 per engine, resulting in a total 
compliance cost of $115 for this representative establishment.  
EPA believes that small entities are most likely to face costs similar to Case 2 (columns 
shaded in gray in Table 6-4) because most of the engines to be affected by this proposal in 
NAICS 111, 112, 238, 211111, and 211112 are under 300 hp capacity, and most small entities in 
these industries will own engines of this size or smaller. However, it is difficult to make a similar 
claim for NAICS 2211, 48621, and 622110 based on the existing distribution of engines in these 
industries.  
For the sales test, we divided the representative establishment compliance costs reported 
in Table 6-4 by the representative establishment receipts reported in Tables 6-2 and 6-3. This is 
known as the cost-to-receipt (i.e., sales) ratio, or the “sales test.” The “sales test” is the impact 
methodology EPA employs in analyzing small entity impacts as opposed to a “profits test,” in 
which annualized compliance costs are calculated as a share of profits.

aCase 2 is the one used to determine the small entity impacts (and to provide the SISNOSE determination) for this 
proposed rule.  
This is because revenues or sales data are commonly available data for entities normally 
impacted by EPA regulations and profits data normally made available are often not the true 
profit earned by firms because of accounting and tax considerations. Revenues as typically 
published are usually correct figures and are more reliably reported when compared to profit 
data. The use of a “sales test” for estimating small business impacts for a rulemaking such as this 
one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on compliance with SBREFA5 and is consistent 
with guidance published by the U.S. SBA’s Office of Advocacy that suggests that cost as a 
percentage of total revenues is a metric for evaluating cost increases on small entities in relation 
to increases on large entities.6  
If the cost-to-receipt ratio is less than 1%, then we consider the proposed rule to not have 
a significant impact on the establishment company in question. We summarize the industries 
with cost-to-receipt ratios exceeding 1% below:

 Case 3: No industries 
Sensitivity Analysis (unlikely): 
 Case 1: NAICS 211112 with less than 20 employees, NAICS 2211, 48621, and 238 
with receipts less than $500,000 per year, and irrigated farms with receipts of 
$100,000 or less per year 
In the Case 2 primary analysis, only establishments in NAICS 2211 with receipts less 
than $100,000 per year have cost-to-receipt ratios above 1%. However, establishments earning 
this level of receipts are likely to be using smaller engines than those assumed in Case 2, such as 
50 to 100 hp engines. The results of our Case 3 analysis demonstrate that these establishments 
are not significantly impacted when taking this engine size into account.  
6.2 Small Government Entities 
The rule also covers sectors that include entities owned by small and large governments. 
However, given the uncertainty and data limitations associated with identifying and 
appropriately classifying these entities, we computed a “revenue” test for a model small 
government, where the annualized compliance cost is a percentage of annual government 
revenues (U.S. Census, 2005a, b). The use of a “revenue test” for estimating impacts to small 
governments for a rulemaking such as this one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on 
compliance with SBREFA,7 and is consistent with guidance published by the US SBA’s Office 
of Advocacy.8 For example, from the 2002 Census (in 2007 dollars), the average revenue for 
small governments (counties and municipalities) with populations fewer than 10,000 are $3 
million per entity, and the average revenue for local governments with populations fewer than 
50,000 is $7 million per entity. For the smallest group of local governments (<10,000 people), 
the cost-to-revenue ratio would be 0.2% or less under each case. For the larger group of 
governments (<50,000 people), the cost-to-revenue ratio is 0.1% or less under all cases.

SECTION 7  
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
7.1 Calculation of Human Health Benefits 
To estimate the PM2.5-related human health benefits of reducing emissions from the 
proposed NESHAP for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE), EPA used the 
benefits transfer approach it created for the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) accompanying the 
recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone.1, 2 In that RIA, EPA 
developed and applied PM2.5 benefit-per-ton coefficients to estimate the PM2.5 co-benefits 
resulting from reductions in emissions of NOX. EPA has followed that same approach to estimate 
the health benefits for the projected emission reductions of PM2.5 precursor pollutants associated 
with this proposal. 
EPA did not perform an air quality modeling assessment of the emission reductions 
resulting from installing controls on these RICE because of the time and resource constraints and 
the limited value of such an analysis for the purposes of developing the regulatory approach for 
this proposal. This lack of air quality modeling limited EPA’s ability to perform a 
comprehensive benefits analysis for this proposal because our benefits model BenMAP requires 
either air quality modeling or monitoring data. In the absence of formal air quality modeling, we 
applied PM2.5 benefit-per-ton (BPT) coefficients to estimate benefits. In addition to the 2008 
Ozone NAAQS RIA, this benefit-per-ton approach has been used in RIAs prepared for a number 
of previous EPA rulemakings, e.g. the 2002 large industrial spark ignition engine and 
recreational vehicles rule, the 2004 Industrial Boilers and Process Heaters MACT, and the 2008 
Petroleum Refineries NSPS. 
The PM2.5 precursor pollutant benefit per-ton estimates provide the total monetized 
human health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and morbidity related benefits) of 
reducing one ton of PM2.5 or PM2.5 precursor emissions from a specified source. We include

direct PM2.5 as PM2.5 precursor emissions (SOX, NOX, and VOCs).3  These PM benefits are 
actually co-benefits, which result from the installing controls to limit hazardous air pollutants 
(HAPs).  Unfortunately, we are unable to quantify the human health benefits of reducing the 
13,000 tons of HAPs, 510,000 tons of carbon monoxide (CO), or ozone precursor pollutants in 
this analysis because benefit-per-ton estimates are not available for these pollutants. The PM co-
benefits estimates in this proposal analysis utilize the concentration-response functions as 
described in the PM NAAQS RIA analysis.4   Specifically, we present two estimates reported in 
the epidemiology literature, as well as a set of 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation 
study.  Each data source is described below: 
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the study of the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort reported in Pope et al. 
(2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary benefits 
estimate.  
 One estimate is based on Laden et al.’s (2006) reporting of the extended Six Cities 
cohort study; this study is a more recent PM epidemiological study that was used as 
an alternative in the PM NAAQS RIA.  
 The source for the other twelve estimates are based on the results of EPA's expert 
elicitation study5,6 on the PM-mortality relationship and interpreted for benefits 
analysis in EPA's final RIA for the PM NAAQS, published in September 2006 (U.S. 
EPA, 2006). For that study, twelve experts (labeled A through L) provided 
independent estimates of the PM-mortality concentration-response function. EPA 
practice has been to develop independent estimates of PM-mortality estimates 
corresponding to the concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve

3 In this analysis, the monetized benefits of reducing VOCs only reflect their effects as a PM2.5 precursor pollutant, 
not as a precursor to ozone. The benefit-per-ton estimate for VOCs includes more uncertainty than the other 
PM2.5 precursor pollutants because the underlying photochemical modeling systematically underpredicts the 
secondary formation of organic carbon due to uncertainties in science of secondary organic carbon formation. 
EPA's modeling system has been peer reviewed, represents the state of science, and uses the best available and 
most comprehensive data sets to characterize meteorology and emissions. Because the relative effectiveness of 
VOC controls are underestimated in the modeling, the benefits of reducing VOCs as a PM2.5 precursor may also 
be underestimated.

EPA considers the benefit-per-ton estimates derived from the expert elicitation to be 
indicative of the range of uncertainty associated with the health functions, whereas the range of 
benefits represented by benefit-per-ton estimates generated using the Pope et al. and Laden et al. 
functions represent the best epidemiology based estimates of PM co-benefits.  
To develop the estimate of benefits of reducing emissions from the proposal, we 
calculated the monetized benefits-per-ton of emission reductions estimates for direct PM2.5 and 
each PM2.5 precursor pollutant.  Readers interested in the complete methodology for creating the 
benefit-per-ton estimates used in this analysis may consult the Technical Support Document 
(TSD) accompanying the final Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008). In the TSD, we describe 
in detail how we generated the benefit-per-ton estimates. In summary, we used a model to 
convert emissions of direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (i.e., SO2, NOX, and VOCs) into changes 
in PM2.5 air quality. Next, we used the benefits model (BenMAP) to estimate the changes in 
human health based on the change in PM2.5 air quality. Finally, the monetized health benefits 
were divided by the emission reductions to create the benefit-per-ton estimates. Even though all 
fine particles are assumed to have equivalent health effects, the benefit-per-ton estimates vary 
between precursors because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form 
PM2.5. For example, NOX has a lower benefit-per-ton estimate than direct PM2.5 because it does 
not form as much PM2.5, thus the exposure would be lower, and the monetized health benefits 
would be lower. For this analysis, we assumed that 40% of the emission reductions were from 
non-EGU point sources and 60% were from area sources for PM and SOX, which are the only 
pollutants for which we have separate benefit-per-ton estimates for non-EGU sources and area 
sources.7  After generating the benefit-per-ton estimate, we then multiply this estimate by the 
number of tons of each pollutant reduced to derive an overall monetary value of benefits.  
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits 
modeling assumptions. Use of these $/ton values to estimate benefits associated with different 
emission control programs (e.g., for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) 
may lead to higher or lower benefit estimates than if benefits were calculated based on direct air 
quality modeling. Great care should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions 
occurring in any specific location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission 
reduction programs and therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United 
                                                 
7 These emission assumptions are taken from the compliance cost analysis memo prepared for the proposed rule 
entitled Impacts Associated with NESHAP for Existing Stationary RICE by Ec/R, Inc. on February 19, 2009.  
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
7-4 
States. The benefits- per-ton for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different 
from the national average. 
7.2 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Benefits Estimates 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 
are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs, it may be possible to provide a statistical 
representation of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the 
necessary information is not available. 
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5), there is a variety 
of uncertainties associated with these PM benefits. Therefore, the estimates of annual benefits 
should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of benefits expected, rather than the actual 
benefits that would occur every year. 
Below we present the estimates of the total benefits, based on our interpretation of the 
best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-HES and the NAS 
(NRC, 2002). The benefits estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. 
For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for premature mortality, which 
typically account for at least 90% of the total PM benefits, we were able to identify the following 
uncertainties: 
1. Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature death at 
concentrations near those experienced by most Americans on a daily basis. Although 
biological mechanisms for this effect have not been established definitively yet, the 
weight of the available epidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality.  
2. All fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in 
causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, because PM produced 
via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ significantly from direct 
PM released from diesel engines and other industrial sources, but no clear scientific 
grounds exist for supporting differential effects estimates by particle type.  
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
7-5 
 
3. The impact function for fine particles is approximately linear within the range of 
ambient concentrations under consideration. Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard.  
4. The forecasts for future emissions and associated air quality modeling are valid. 
Although recognizing the difficulties, assumptions, and inherent uncertainties in the 
overall enterprise, these analyses are based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and 
up-to-date assessment tools, and we believe the results are highly useful in assessing 
this proposal.  
5. Benefits estimated here reflect the application of a national dollar benefit-per-ton 
estimate of the benefits of reducing directly emitted fine particulates from point 
sources. Because they are based on national-level analysis, the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used here do not reflect local variability in population density, meteorology, 
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an 
over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted 
fine particulates.  
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the 
benefits model (BenMAP). Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and 
associated estimates of uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the 
significant differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. 
However, the results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in 
Chapter 5 of the PM RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the benefits 
results presented in this analysis. In this analysis, we provide benefits estimates using 
concentration-response functions based on two epidemiology studies as well as twelve benefits 
estimates based on the concentration-response functions from the expert elicitation.  While this 
captures only a fraction of the overall uncertainty, the magnitude of the mortality C-R function is 
a critical parameter in the analysis and the uncertainty in that parameter is likely to contribute a 
large fraction of the overall uncertainty in the benefits estimates. 
7.3 Updating the Benefits Data Underlying the Benefit-per-Ton Estimates 
As described above, the estimates provided are derived through a benefits transfer 
technique that adapts monetized benefits from reductions in PM2.5 precursor pollutants that were 
estimated for the Ozone RIA utilizing nationally distributed emissions reductions. The benefit-
per-ton estimates for this analysis have been updated since the Ozone RIA was completed. They 
OMB Review Draft – February 23, 2009 
7-6 
have been updated to reflect a new population dataset, a more recent currency year.8 EPA is 
currently in the process of generating localized benefit-per-ton estimates to better account for the 
spatial heterogeneity of benefits for a small number of urban areas. EPA believes that these 
estimates may better represent the localized benefits than estimates that use national averages. 
However, because the engines affected by this rule should be widely distributed nationally, we 
believe that the national estimates are most appropriate for this analysis. 
In addition to generating local benefit-per-ton estimates, EPA is also exploring other 
updates to the national benefit-per-ton estimates.  Technical updates would incorporate a new 
population dataset and expand the geographic scope of the national estimates.  EPA is also 
exploring changing the assumption regarding thresholds in the health impact function.  In 
previous RIAs, EPA has included sensitivity analyses for premature mortality, with alternative 
cutpoints at 0 µg/m3, 7.5 µg/m3, 12 µg/m3, and 14 µg/m3.  As a sensitivity analysis for this 
analysis, EPA explored the implication of replacing the threshold assumption with log-linear no-
threshold models similar to the authors of those original studies. 9  The health impact functions 
applied for our premature mortality benefits estimates are based on an assumed cutpoint at 10 
µg/m3 in the long-term mortality concentration-response function and short-term morbidity 
concentration-response functions.  Removing the threshold assumption for this proposed rule 
increases the benefits based on Pope et al by 30% and increases the benefits based on Laden at al 
by 50% over the numbers presented in the tables below.  Because this analysis uses benefit-per-
ton estimates, we are unable to do a sensitivity analysis using the other alternative cutpoints 
analyzed previously.   
EPA is considering this policy change in light of the results of the expert elicitation on 
PM mortality (Roman et al, 2008).  Specifically, of the 12 experts included in the expert 
elicitation, only one expert elected to specify a threshold, as the rest cited a lack of empirical 
and/or theoretical basis for a population threshold.  Furthermore, that one expert only specified a 
50% probability of a threshold (most likely at or below 5 µg/m3), which is below the cut-point 
that EPA has historically assumed.   
                                                 
8 Previous RIAs reported the benefit-per-ton estimates using 2006$. However, to be consistent with the cost 
estimates, we also updated the benefits estimates in this analysis to 2007$. Updating the currency year does not 
affect the comparison of costs and benefits because each is adjusted consistently.

Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (External Review Draft) (U.S. EPA, 2008).  Available on the Internet

assumed to have equivalent health effects, but the benefit per ton estimates vary between precursors because each 
ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form PM2.5. The monetized benefits incorporate the 
conversion from precursor emissions to ambient fine particles.

7.5 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
In the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates the range13 of annualized 
benefits of this proposal to be $930 million to $2.0 billion ($2007) at a 3% discount rate14 and 
$850 million to $1.8 billion ($2007) at a 7% discount rate with annualized costs of $345 million 
($2007) at a 7% interest rate as mentioned in Chapter 4 of this RIA. Thus, the net benefits of the 
                                                 
13 This range represents benefits estimates derived from the Pope et al. study to the Laden et al. study, not the entire 
range of the expert elicitation. This range captures most of the expert opinion, while preserving the empirical 
basis of our estimates. Uncertainty goes beyond the range shown here.  
14 The benefits are discounted to account for the cessation lag in PM2.5 benefits from premature mortality and acute 
myocardial infarctions (AMIs), rather than a discounted stream of future benefits; whereas discounting the costs 
reflects the lifetime costs of the equipment. For this reason, it is appropriate in this context to use two different 
discount rates for the benefits and costs.

RICE NESHAP are $590 million to $1.6 billion at a 3% discount rate and $500 million to $1.5 
billion at a 7% discount rate. Figures 7.2 and 7.3 show the all net benefits estimates (i.e., annual 
benefits in 2013 minus annualized costs) utilizing all 14 different PM2.5 mortality functions. EPA 
believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the costs by a substantial margin under this 
proposal even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has characterized the facilities and 
companies potentially affected by the proposed reciprocating internal combustion engines 
(RICE) National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) by examining 
existing sources and the companies that own them.  
EPA estimates that complying with the proposed RICE rule will have an annualized cost 
of approximately $345 million per year (2007 dollars) at a discount rate of 7 percent and $331 
million per year at a discount rate of 3 percent (also 2007 dollars) in the year of full 
implementation of the rule (2013). Using these costs, EPA estimates in its economic impact 
analysis that the NESHAP will have limited impacts on the eight industries affected and their 
consumers. Using sales data obtained for affected small entities in an analysis of the impacts of 
this proposal on small entities, EPA expects that the proposed NESHAP will not result in a 
SISNOSE (a significant economic impacts for a substantial number of small entities). EPA also 
does not expect significant adverse energy impacts based on Executive Order 13211, an 
Executive Order that requires analysis of energy impacts for rules such as this one that are 
economically significant under Executive Order 12866.  
The proposed RICE rule is also considered subject to the requirements of the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Circular A-4 because EPA expects that either the benefits 
or the costs are potentially $1 billion or higher.  EPA estimates the monetized benefits of this 
proposed NESHAP to be $930 million to $2.0 billion (2007$, at a 3 percent discount rate) in the 
year of full implementation (2013); higher or lower estimates are plausible according to alternate 
models identified by experts describing the relationship between PM2.5 and premature mortality 
(Roman et al. 2008). The benefits at a 7 percent discount rate are $850 million to $1.8 billion 
(2007$). EPA believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the annualized costs of $345 million 
by a substantial margin under this rulemaking even when taking into account uncertainties in the 
cost and benefit estimates.

SECTION 2  
INTRODUCTION  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently preparing a proposed National 
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) to reduce hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) emissions from existing reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE). This 
rulemaking is on a court-ordered schedule to be proposed by February 25, 2009, and then 
promulgated by February 10, 2010. Regulations affecting new and reconstructed stationary 
diesel HAP and criteria pollutant emissions were issued in March 2004, July 2006, and 
December 2007. This latest rulemaking is meant to target those emissions sources (HAP, 
primarily) in the same industries that were not affected by these three different regulations. This 
rulemaking consists of a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard that will 
be applied to major sources of HAP emissions and a Generally Available Control Technology 
(GACT) standard that will be applied to area sources of HAP emissions. The proposed rule is 
economically significant according to Executive Order 12866. As part of the regulatory process 
of preparing these standards, EPA has prepared an economic impact analysis (RIA). This 
analysis includes an analysis of impacts to small entities as part of compliance with the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) and an analysis of impacts on energy 
consumption and production to comply with Executive Order 13211 (Statement of Energy 
Effects).

SECTION 3  
INDUSTRY PROFILE 
This section provides an introduction to the industries affected by the proposed rule. The 
purpose is to give the reader a general understanding of the economic aspects of the industry; 
their relative size, relationships with other sectors in the economy, trends for the industries, and 
financial statistics. The sectors discussed are 
 electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, 
 oil and gas extraction (including marginal wells), 
 pipeline transportation of natural gas, 
 general medical and surgical hospitals, and 
 irrigation sets and welding equipment. 
3.1 Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution 
3.1.1 Overview 
Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution (NAICS 2211) is an industry 
group within the utilities sector (NAICS 22). It includes establishments that produce electrical 
energy or facilitate its transmission to the final consumer.  
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from electric power grew about 10% to over $373 billion 
($2007) (Table 3-1). At the same time, payroll rose about 6.5% and the number of employees 
decreased by over 5%. The number of establishments rose by over 15%, resulting in a decrease 
in average establishment revenue of almost 7%. Industrial production within NAICS 2211 has 
increased 25% since 1997 (Figure 3-1).  
Electric utility companies have traditionally been tightly regulated monopolies. Since 
1978, several laws and orders have been passed to encourage competition within the electricity 
market. In the late 1990s, many states began the process of restructuring their utility regulatory 
framework to support a competitive market. Following market manipulation in the early 2000s, 
however, several states have suspended their restructuring efforts. The majority (58%) of diesel 
power generators controlled by combined heat and power (CHP) or independent power 
producers are located in states undergoing active restructuring (Figure 3-2).

 Receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes. 
 Firm: A firm is a business organization consisting of one or more domestic 
establishments in the same state and industry that were specified under common 
ownership or control. The firm and the establishment are the same for single-
establishment firms. For each multiestablishment firm, establishments in the same 
industry within a state are counted as one firm; the firm employment and annual 
payroll are summed from the associated establishments. 
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise; the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
In 2002, Texas had almost 1,000 power establishments, while California, Georgia, and 
Ohio all had between 400 and 500 (Figure 3-3). Hawaii, Nebraska, and Rhode Island all had 
fewer than 20 establishments in their states.

As shown in Table 3-3, the four largest firms owned over 1,200 establishments and 
accounted for about 16% of total industry receipts/revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for 
almost 6,000 establishments and about 78% of total receipts/revenue.  
Investor-owned energy providers accounted for 67.5% of retail electricity sold in the 
United States in 2006 (Table 3-4). In 2007, less regulated investor-owned electric utility 
companies were on average more profitable than companies with greater regulation (Table 3-5). 
In 2006, enterprises within NAICS 2211 had a pre-tax profit margin of only 0.9% (Table 3-6). 
In 2002, about 82% of firms generating, transmitting, or distributing electric power had 
receipts of under $50 million (Table 3-7). However, these firms accounted for only 11% of 
employment, with 89% of employees working for firms with revenues in excess of $100 million.

through such activities as exploring for oil and gas, drilling and equipping wells, operating on-
site equipment, and conducting other activities up to the point of shipment from the property.  
Oil and gas extraction consists of two industries: crude petroleum and natural gas 
extraction (NAICS 211111) and natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112). Crude petroleum 
and natural gas extraction is the larger industry; in 2002, it accounted for 93% of establishments 
and 75% of oil and gas extraction revenues. 
Industrial production in this industry is particularly sensitive to hurricanes in the Gulf 
Coast. In September of both 2005 and 2008, production dropped 14% from the previous month. 
Production is currently 6% lower than it was in 1997 (Figure 3-4). 
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from crude petroleum and natural gas extraction (NAICS 
211111) grew less than 1% to almost $100 billion ($2007) (Table 3-8). At the same time, payroll 
dropped almost 8% and the number of employees dropped by almost 6%. The number of 
establishments dropped by over 8%; as a result, the average establishment revenue increased by 
2.5%. Materials costs were approximately 25% of revenue over the period. 
From 1997 to 2002, revenue from natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112) grew 
over 7% to about $34 billion (Table 3-9). At the same time, payroll dropped 12% and the number 
of employees dropped by almost 9%. The number of establishments dropped by over 3%, 
resulting in an increase of revenue per establishment of about 10%.

3.2.2 Goods and Services Used 
The oil and gas extraction industry has similar labor and tax requirements as the electric 
power generation sector. Extraction, support, power, and equipment requirements potentially 
associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines (oil and gas extraction, support 
activities, electric power generation, machinery and equipment rental and leasing, and pipeline 
transportation) represent around 8% of the value of services (Table 3-10).

designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
In 2002, Texas had almost 3,000 crude petroleum and natural gas extraction 
establishments, Oklahoma had about 1,000, and every other state had under 450 (Figure 3-5). 
Twenty states had fewer than 10 establishments. Similarly, Texas had 180 natural gas liquid 
extraction establishments, Louisiana had 76, and every other state had under 40 (Figure 3-6). 
Only nine states had 10 or more establishments, and 17 had no establishments. 
According to the SUSB, 89% of crude petroleum and natural gas extraction firms had 
fewer than 500 employees in 2002 (Table 3-11). Sixty-three percent of natural gas liquid 
extraction firms had fewer than 500 employees in 2002 (Table 3-12). 
Enterprises within this industry generated $165 billion in total receipts in 2006. Including 
those enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after-tax profit margin of 18.3% 
(Table 3-13).

This industry includes small-volume wells that are mature in age, are more difficult to extract oil 
or natural gas from than other types of wells, and generally operate at very low levels of 
profitability. As a result, well operations can be quite responsive to small changes in the benefits 
and costs of their operation. 
In 2006, there were approximately 420,000 marginal oil wells and 300,000 marginal gas 
wells (Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission [IOGCC], 2007). These wells provide the 
United States with 18% of oil and 9% of natural gas (IOGCC, 2007). Data for 2006 show that 
revenue from the over 700,000 wells was approximately $31.3 billion (Table 3-14). 
Historical data show marginal oil production fluctuated between 1997 and 2006, 
reflecting the industry’s sensitivity to changes in economic conditions of fuel markets (see

Figure 3-7). In contrast, the number of marginal gas wells has continually increased during the 
past decade; the IOGCC estimates that daily production levels from these wells reached a 
10-year high in 2005. Although we have been unable to find data on what fraction of these 
marginal wells are operated by small businesses, the IOGCC states that many are run by “mom 
and pop operators” (IOGCC, 2007). 
3.3 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas 
3.3.1 Overview 
Pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 48621) is an industry group within the 
transportation and warehousing sector (NAICS 48-49), but more specifically in the pipeline 
transportation subsector (486). It includes the transmission of natural gas as well as the 
distribution of the gas through a local network to participating businesses.  
From 1997 to 2002, natural gas transportation revenues fell by 7% to just under $23 
billion ($2007) (Table 3-15). At the same time, payroll decreased by 7%, while the number of 
paid employees decreased by nearly 9%. However, the number of establishments increased by 
17% from 1,450 establishments in 1997 to 1,701 in 2002. 
3.3.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports pipeline transportation of natural gas only for total pipeline 
transportation (3-digit NAICS 486). In addition to pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 
4862), this industry includes pipeline transportation of crude oil (NAICS 4861) and other 
pipeline transportation (NAICS 4869. However, the BEA data are likely representative of the 
affected sector since pipeline transportation of natural gas accounts for 68% of NAICS 486 
establishments and 72% of revenues (Figures 3-8 and 3-9).

3.3.3 Business Statistics 
The pipeline transportation of natural gas is clearly concentrated in the two states closest 
to the refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2002, Texas and Louisiana contributed to 31% of all 
pipeline transportation establishments in the United States (Figure 3-10) and 41% of all U.S. 
revenues. Other larger contributors with over 50 establishments in their states include Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

(November 10, 2008). 
According to 2002 U.S. Census data, about 86% of transportation of natural gas 
establishments were owned by corporations and about 8% were owned by individual 
proprietorships. About 6% were owned by partnerships (Figure 3-11). As shown in Table 3-17, 
the four largest firms accounted for nearly half of the establishments with 698, and just over half, 
51%, of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,354 establishments and about 
99% of total revenue. The average number of employees per establishment was approximately 
17 across all groups of firms.  
Enterprises within pipeline transportation (NAICS 486) generated $6.6 billion in total 
receipts in 2006. Including those enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after-
tax profit margin of 7.9% (Table 3-18). 
The 2002 SUSB shows that 47% of all firms in this industry made under $5 million in 
revenue. Enterprises with revenue over $100 million provided an overwhelming share of 
employment in this industry (98%) (Table 3-19).

3.4 General Medical and Surgical Hospitals 
3.4.1 Overview 
General medical and surgical hospitals (NAICS 6221) is an industry group within the 
health care and social assistance sector (NAICS 62). It includes hospitals engaged in diagnostic 
and medical treatment (both surgical and nonsurgical) for inpatients with a broad range of 
medical conditions. They usually provide other services as well, including outpatient care, 
anatomical pathology, diagnostic X-rays, clinical laboratory work, and pharmacy services.  
From 1997 to 2002, hospital revenues grew about 18% to over $500 billion ($2007) 
(Table 3-20). At the same time, payroll rose about 14%, while the number of employees 
increased by only 5%. The number of establishments declined during this period by almost 6%, 
resulting in an increase in revenue per establishment of almost 22%. 
3.4.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports hospital expenditures only for hospitals (3-digit NAICS 622). In 
addition to general hospitals (NAICS 6221), this industry includes psychiatric and substance 
abuse hospitals (NAICS 6222) and specialty hospitals (NAICS 6223). However, these data 
should be representative of the affected sector since in 2002, general medical and surgical 
hospitals accounted for 92% of NAICS 622 establishments and 94% of revenues. 
In Table 3-21, we use the latest detailed benchmark input-output data report by the BEA 
(2002) to identify the goods and services used by hospitals (NAICS 622). As shown, labor and 
land requirements represent a significant share of the value of hospital services. Power and 
equipment requirements potentially associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines 
(electric power generation and commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair and 
maintenance) represent less than 2% of the value of services.

According to 2002 Census data, 79.6% of general hospitals were owned by corporations, 
19.5% were individual proprietorships, and about 0.7% were partnerships (Figure 3-13). As 
shown in Table 3-22, the four largest firms accounted for almost 400 establishments and about 
10% of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,100 establishments and about 
30% of total revenue. In addition, about 27% of all general hospitals are owned or controlled by 
the government, with most of those at the local level (Table 3-23). 
In 2006, the United States had 4,927 community hospitals (Table 3-24); 
nongovernmental not-for-profit hospitals accounted for 59% of these hospitals, and 75% of the 
expenses of all community hospitals.  
Enterprises including hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities, and social 
assistance (NAICS 622-4) generated $108 billion in total receipts in 2006. Including those 
enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after- tax profit margin of 3.1% (Table 
3-25).

The SUSB reports 27% of general hospitals have receipts of less than $10 million and 
41% report receipts above $50 million (Table 3-26). Large hospitals employ a significant share 
of the people working in this industry.  
3.5 Irrigation Sets and Welding Equipment 
3.5.1 Overview 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies irrigation equipment under the farm machinery and 
equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333111). This U.S. industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing agricultural and farm machinery and 
equipment and other turf and grounds care equipment, including planting, harvesting, and grass-
mowing equipment (except lawn and garden type).  
From 1997 to 2002, farm machinery and equipment manufacturing revenues fell by $3 
billion from $18 billion to $15 billion (Table 3-27). At the same time, payroll decreased by 19% 
and the number of paid employees decreased by nearly 19%. The number of establishments 
dropped by 9% from 1,339 establishments in 1997 to 1,214 in 2002. Industrial production in the 
industry is currently 13% lower than in 1997 (Figure 3-14). 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies welding equipment under the welding and 
soldering equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333992). This U.S. industry 
comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing welding and soldering equipment 
and accessories (except transformers), such as welding electrodes, welding wire, and soldering 
equipment (except handheld). 
From 1997 to 2002 welding and soldering equipment manufacturing revenue fell by 
about 22% to $1 billion (Table 3-28). At the same time, payroll decreased by 21% and the 
number of paid employees decreased by nearly 28%. The number of establishments dropped by 
8% from 250 establishments in 1997 to 231 in 2002. 
3.5.2 Irrigation and Welding Services 
The demand for equipment is derived from the demand for the services the equipment 
provides. We describe uses and industrial consumers of this equipment. 
3.5.2.1 Irrigation 
Demand for irrigation equipment is driven by farm operation decisions, optimal 
replacement considerations, and climate and weather conditions. The National Agriculture 
Statistics Service (NASS) 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (USDA-NASS, 2004) shows

that the top five states ranked by total acres irrigated are California, Nebraska, Texas, Arkansas, 
and Idaho. Approximately 32 million of the 53 million, or 68%, of U.S. irrigated acres are used 
to support oilseed and grain farming and other crop farming (tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and 
other). 
The survey reported that approximately 500,000 pumps were used on U.S. farms in 2003 
with energy expenses totaling $1.6 billion. Electricity is the dominant form of energy expense for 
irrigation pumps, accounting for 60% of total energy expenses. Diesel fuel is second (18%), 
followed by natural gas (18%) and other forms of energy such as gasoline (4%).  
Per-acre operating costs for these irrigation systems vary by fuel type, and natural gas 
was the most expensive in 2003 ($57 per acre for well systems and $34 per acre for surface water 
systems) (Table 3-29). Systems using diesel fuel were operated at approximately half of these 
per-acre costs ($25 per acre for well systems and $16 per acre for surface water systems). 
Gasoline- and gasohol-powered systems offered the least expensive operating costs ($12 per acre 
for well systems and $18 per acre for surface water systems).  
As shown in Table 3-30, the number of on-farm pumps fell from 508,727 to 497,443 
(2%) between 1998 and 2003. However, the use of electric- and diesel-powered pumps increased 
during this period (3% and 4%, respectively), while other fuel sources such as gasoline declined 
significantly. Pumps powered by gasoline and gasohol, for example, declined from 8,965 to 
6,178, a 31% change during this period. Pumps powered by natural gas, LP gas, propane, and 
butane also declined by 26% to 29%. Although 1998 operating cost data are not available, the 
change in relative costs of operation across fuels between 1998 and 2003 may partly explain

these patterns. Although no information is available on the use and construction of on-farm 
pumps specifically, their use is tied to the amount of agricultural land in production. USDA 
reports that planted acres of the eight major crops hit a 5-year high of 252 million acres in 2008 
but will fall and level off to around 244 million acres over the next 2 to 4 years (USDA, 2008). 
3.5.2.2 Welding  
Welding is used in a wide variety of applications. One of the biggest manufacturers of 
welding products identifies the following key end-user segments: 
 general metal fabrication; 
 infrastructure including oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges, 
and power generation;

 transportation and defense industries (automotive, trucks, rail, ships, and 
aerospace); 
 equipment manufacturers in construction, farming, and mining; 
 retail resellers; and 
 rental market (Lincoln Electric Holdings, 2006). 
Lincoln Electric further describes the following key applications: power generation and process 
industries, offshore production of oil and gas, pipelines/pipemills, and heavy fabrication 
(earthmoving and construction equipment and agricultural and farm equipment. 
3.5.3 Business Statistics 
In 2003, California and Texas each had more than 5 million irrigated acres (Figure 3-15). 
Midwest states like Arkansas and Nebraska had more than 2.5 million irrigated acres. Heavy and 
civil engineering construction establishments are spread throughout the United States, 
particularly in areas such as California, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida (Figure 3-16). Each 
of these states has more than 2,000 establishments.

As shown in Table 3-31, the market value of agriculture products sold was less than 
$25,000 per year on almost half the irrigated farms in the 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation 
Survey. Over 90% of the irrigated farms had agricultural product revenue below $750,000. It is 
not clear what fraction of these farms use stationary diesel engines or are owned by corporate 
farming operations. However, SUSB data also suggest 65% of firms in NAICS 11 have receipts 
less than $500,000 per year.

As noted earlier, welding equipment is used in heavy fabrication such as earthmoving and 
construction equipment. We focus on the size distribution for a representative sector in this 
section (NAICS 327, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction); other subsections in Section 2 
cover other sectors that potentially use equipment powered by diesel engines (e.g., power 
generation and offshore gas distribution). As shown in Table 3-33, SUSB data suggest 60% of 
firms in this industry have receipts less than $1 million per year; 90% are below the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) threshold on $50 million per year. However, it is not clear what 
fraction of these firms use stationary diesel engines.

SECTION 4  
REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES, COSTS, AND EMISSION IMPACTS 
4.1 Background 
This action proposes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) 
from existing stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) with a site rating of 
less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources, and existing stationary RICE located at 
area sources.  The final NESHAP for stationary RICE would be promulgated under 40 CFR part 
63, subpart ZZZZ, which already contains standards applicable to new stationary RICE and 
existing stationary RICE with a site rating above 500 hp located at major sources.    In addition, 
EPA is proposing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for existing stationary 
compression ignition engines greater than 500 brake horsepower that are located at major 
sources, based on a new review of these engines following the first RICE NESHAP rulemaking 
in 2004.  Also,  this action proposes NESHAP for existing stationary RICE of any power rating 
located at area sources. In addition, EPA is proposing to amend the previously promulgated 
regulations regarding operation of stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines during 
periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction. EPA is proposing these requirements to meet its 
statutory obligation to address hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions from these sources 
under sections 112(d) and 112(k) of the CAA. 
EPA promulgated NESHAP (in this case, a MACT standard) for existing, new, and 
reconstructed stationary RICE greater than 500 hp located at major sources on June 15, 2004 
(69 FR 33474). EPA promulgated NESHAP for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that are 
located at area sources of HAP emissions and for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that 
have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 hp that are located at major sources of HAP 
emissions on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 3568). At that time, EPA did not promulgate a final 
decision for existing stationary RICE that are located at area sources of HAP emissions or for 
existing stationary RICE that have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 hp that are located at 
major sources of HAP emissions due to comments received indicating that the proposed MACT 
determinations for existing sources were inappropriate and because of a U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling on March 13, 2007, involving litigation on the “Brick 
MACT,” which set emission standards for major sources in that source category (40 CFR part 
63, subpart JJJJJ), that appeared to impact EPA’s ability to finalize its proposed “no reduction” 
MACT standards for existing sources. Sierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875 (DC Cir 2007). Among

other things, the D.C. Circuit found that EPA’s no emission reduction MACT determination in 
the challenged rule was unlawful. Because in the proposed stationary RICE rule EPA used a 
MACT floor methodology similar to the methodology used in the Brick MACT, EPA decided to 
re-evaluate the MACT floors for existing major sources that have a site rating of less than or 
equal to 500 brake hp consistent with the Court’s decision in the Brick MACT case. EPA has 
also re-evaluated the standards for existing area sources in light of the comments received on the 
proposed rule.  
This proposal initiates a separate rulemaking process that focuses on existing sources. 
EPA has gathered further information on existing engines and has considered comments it 
received on the original proposed rule and the intervening court decision in creating this 
proposed rulemaking.  
In addition, stakeholders have encouraged the Agency to review whether there are further 
ways to reduce emissions of pollutants from existing stationary diesel engines. In its comments 
on EPA’s 2006 proposed rule for new stationary diesel engines,1
 
Environmental Defense Fund 
suggested several possible avenues for the regulation of existing stationary diesel engines, 
including use of diesel oxidation catalysts or catalyzed diesel particulate filters (CDPF), as well 
as the use of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. Environmental Defense Fund suggested that 
such controls can provide significant pollution reductions at reasonable cost. EPA issued an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in January 2008, where it solicited comment 
on several issues concerning options to regulate emissions of pollutants from existing stationary 
diesel engines, generally, and specifically from larger, older stationary diesel engines. EPA 
solicited comment and collected information to aid decision-making related to the reduction of 
HAP emissions from existing stationary diesel engines and specifically from larger, older 
engines under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 authorities. The Agency sought comment on the 
larger, older engines because available data indicate that those engines emit the majority of 
particulate matter (PM) and toxic emissions from non-emergency stationary engines as a whole.  
EPA has taken several actions over the past several years to reduce exhaust pollutants 
from stationary diesel engines, but believes that further reducing exhaust pollutants from 
stationary diesel engines, particularly existing stationary diesel engines that have not been 
subject to Federal standards, are justified. Therefore, EPA is proposing emissions reductions 
from existing stationary diesel engines.

4.2 Summary of the Proposed Rule 
4.2.1 What Is the Source Category Regulated by this Proposed Rule?  
This proposed rule addresses emissions from existing stationary engines less than or 
equal to 500 hp located at major sources and all stationary engines located at area sources. A 
major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single 
HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate 
of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a 
major source of HAP emissions is determined for each surface site. An area source of HAP 
emissions is a source that is not a major source. This proposed rule also addresses emissions 
from existing compression ignition (CI) engines greater than 500 hp located at major sources. 
4.2.1.1 Stationary RICE ≤500 hp at Major Sources 
This action proposes to revise 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, to address HAP emissions 
from existing stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources. For 
stationary engines less than or equal to 500 hp at major sources, EPA must determine what is the 
appropriate MACT for those engines under section 112(d)(3) of the CAA. 
EPA has divided the source category into the following subcategories: stationary RICE 
less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, CI 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, and spark ignition (SI) stationary RICE greater 
than or equal to 50 hp. The CI stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp subcategory was 
further subcategorized into emergency and non-emergency engines, as was the subcategory of SI 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp. Spark ignition non-emergency stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 50 hp were then subcategorized into 2-stroke lean burn (2SLB), 4-stroke 
lean burn (4SLB), and 4-stroke rich burn (4SRB) stationary RICE. The 2SLB and 4SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp subcategories were further subcategorized into 
below 250 hp and greater than or equal to 250 hp. 
4.2.1.2 Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
This action proposes to revise 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, in order to address HAP 
emissions from existing stationary RICE located at area sources. For stationary engines located 
at area sources, EPA has the flexibility to promulgate standards based on generally available 
control technology or management practices (GACT) under CAA section 112(d)(5). EPA is 
required to address HAP emissions from stationary RICE located at area sources under section 
112(k) of the CAA, based on criteria set forth by EPA in the Urban Air Toxics Strategy.

The subcategories for area sources are the same as those for major sources and are: 
stationary RICE less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal 
to 50 hp, CI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, CI non-emergency 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp, SI emergency stationary RICE greater than or 
equal to 50 hp, SI non-emergency 2SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less 
than 250 hp, SI non-emergency 2SLB greater than or equal to 250 hp, SI non-emergency 4SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, SI non-emergency 4SLB 
greater than or equal to 250 hp, and SI non-emergency 4SRB stationary RICE greater than or 
equal to 50 hp.  
4.2.1.3 Stationary CI RICE >500 hp at Major Sources 
In addition, EPA is proposing emission standards for stationary CI engines greater than 
500 hp at major sources under its authority to review and revise emission standards as necessary 
under section 112(d)(6) of the CAA. 
4.2.2 What Are the Pollutants Regulated by this Proposed Rule? 
The rule being proposed in this action would regulate emissions of HAP. Available 
emissions data show that several HAP, which are formed during the combustion process or 
which are contained within the fuel burned, are emitted from stationary engines. The HAP which 
have been measured in emission tests conducted on natural gas fired and diesel fired RICE 
include: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,3-butadiene, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, acetaldehyde, acrolein, 
benzene, chlorobenzene, chloroethane, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, methanol, methylene 
chloride, n-hexane, naphthalene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic organic matter, 
styrene, tetrachloroethane, toluene, and xylene. Metallic HAP from diesel fired stationary RICE 
that have been measured are: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and 
selenium.   Although numerous HAP may be emitted from RICE, only a few account for 
essentially all of the mass of HAP emissions from stationary RICE. These HAP are: 
Formaldehyde, acrolein, methanol, and acetaldehyde. 
EPA described the health effects of these HAP and other HAP emitted from the operation 
of stationary RICE in the preamble to 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, published on June 15, 
2004 (69 FR 33474). These HAP emissions are known to cause, or contribute significantly to air 
pollution, which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. 
EPA is proposing to limit emissions of HAP through emissions standards for 
formaldehyde for non-emergency 4SRB engines, emergency SI engines, and engines less than 50

HP, and through emission standards for carbon monoxide (CO) for all other engines. For the 
RICE NESHAP promulgated in 2004 (69 FR 33474) for engines greater than 500 HP located at 
major sources, EPA chose to select formaldehyde to serve as a surrogate for HAP emissions. 
Formaldehyde is the hazardous air pollutant present in the highest concentration in the exhaust 
from stationary engines. In addition, emissions data show that formaldehyde emission levels are 
related to other HAP emission levels.  
For the NESHAP promulgated in 2004, EPA also found that there is a relationship 
between CO emissions reductions and HAP emissions reductions from 2SLB, 4SLB, and CI 
stationary engines. Therefore, because testing for CO emissions has many advantages over 
testing for formaldehyde, CO emissions were chosen as a surrogate for HAP emissions 
reductions for 2SLB, 4SLB, and CI stationary engines operating with oxidation catalyst systems 
for that rule. However, EPA could not confirm the same relationship between CO and 
formaldehyde for 4SRB engines, so emission standards for such engines were provided in terms 
of formaldehyde.  
For the standards being proposed in this action, EPA believes that previous decisions 
regarding the appropriateness of using formaldehyde and CO both in concentration (ppm) levels 
as has been done for stationary sources before as surrogates for HAP are still valid.2 
Consequently, EPA is proposing emission standards for formaldehyde for 4SRB engines and 
emission standards for CO for lean burn and CI engines in order to regulate HAP emissions. 
Information EPA has received from stationary engine manufacturers indicate that most SI 
emergency engines and engines below 50 HP are and will be 4SRB engines. As discussed above, 
EPA could not confirm a relationship between CO and formaldehyde emissions for 4SRB 
engines. Therefore, EPA is proposing standards for formaldehyde for those engines. EPA is 
interested in receiving comments on the use of formaldehyde as a surrogate for HAP and 
information on any other surrogates that may be better indicators of total HAP emissions and 
their reductions. 
We recognize that stationary diesel engines emit trace amounts of metal HAP that remain 
in the particle phase. EPA believes that formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total 
HAP. Although metal HAP emissions from existing diesel engines are very small – about 130 
                                                 
2 In contrast, mobile source emission standards for diesel engines (both nonroad and on-highway) are promulgated 
on a mass basis rather than concentration.

 4-6 
tons per year – we are interested in receiving comments and data about more appropriate 
surrogates, if any, for the metallic HAP emissions. 
In addition to reducing HAP and CO, the proposed rule would likely result in the 
reduction of PM emissions from existing diesel engines. The aftertreatment technologies 
expected to be used to reduce HAP and CO emissions also reduce emissions of PM from diesel 
engines. Furthermore, this proposed rule would also result in nitrogen oxides (NOx) reductions 
from rich burn engines since these engines would likely need to install non-selective catalytic 
reduction (NSCR) technology that helps reduce NOx in addition to CO and HAP emissions. 
Also, we propose the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for stationary non-emergency CI 
engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder that use diesel 
fuel, which would result in lower emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and sulfate particulate by 
reducing the sulfur content in the fuel. It should be noted that SO2 emission reduction estimates 
expected from the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel and shown later in this RIA chapter 
assume that affected stationary diesel engines will switch from fuel containing 500 ppm sulfur to 
fuel containing 15 ppm sulfur.  The compliance cost estimates for the proposed rule do not 
account for fuel price increases that may result from using ULSD. 
4.2.3 What Are the Proposed Standards? 
4.2.3.1 Existing Stationary RICE at Major Sources  
The emission standards proposed in this action for stationary RICE less than or equal to 
500 hp located at major sources and stationary CI RICE greater than 300 hp located at major 
sources are shown in Table 4-1.  Note that EPA is also co-proposing that the same standards 
apply during both normal operation and periods of startup and malfunctions.

In addition, certain existing stationary RICE located at major sources are subject to fuel 
requirements. Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI engines greater 
than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder located at major sources that 
use diesel fuel must use only diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 80.510(b), which 
requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 parts per million (ppm) and either 
a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent. 
4.2.3.2 Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
The emission standards and requirements proposed in this action for stationary RICE 
located at existing area sources are shown in Table 4-2. Note that EPA is also co-proposing that

4.2.3.3 Operating Limitations 
The EPA is proposing operating limitations for stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 
4SRB, and CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source, and stationary 
non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at a major source. Owners 
and operators of engines that are equipped with oxidation catalyst or NSCR must maintain the

catalyst so that the pressure drop across the catalyst does not change by more than 2 inches of 
water from the pressure drop across the catalyst that was measured during the initial performance 
test. Owners and operators of these engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary 
RICE exhaust so that the catalyst inlet temperature is between 450 and 1,350°F for engines with 
an oxidation catalyst and 750 to 1,250°F for engines with NSCR. Owners and operators of 
engines that are not using oxidation catalyst or NSCR must comply with any operating 
limitations approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.3.4 Fuel Requirements 
In addition to emission standards and management practices, certain stationary CI RICE 
located at existing area sources are subject to fuel requirements. These fuel requirements are 
proposed in order to reduce the potential formation of sulfate compounds that are emitted when 
high sulfur diesel fuel is used in combination with oxidation catalysts and to assist in the efficient 
operation of the oxidation catalysts. Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency CI 
engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder located at 
existing area sources that use diesel fuel must only use diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 
CFR 80.510(b), which requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm and 
either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent.  
4.2.3.5 New or Reconstructed Stationary RICE >500 HP at Major Sources, New or 
Reconstructed 4SLB Stationary RICE ≥ 250 HP at Major Sources and Existing 4SRB 
Stationary RICE >500 HP at Major Sources 
 
 The EPA is co-proposing, in the alternative, as explained below, to amend the existing 
regulations for new and reconstructed non-emergency 2SLB and CI stationary RICE >500 HP at 
major sources, new and reconstructed non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE ≥ 250 HP at major 
sources, and existing 4SRB stationary RICE >500 HP at major sources, in order to set limits 
during periods of startup and malfunction.  These emission limitations are shown in Table 4-3.  
Note that EPA is also co-proposing that the same standards apply during both normal operation 
and periods of startup and malfunctions. 
4.2.3.6  Operating Limitations and Management Practices 
 The EPA is proposing operating limitations for existing stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 
4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE that are greater than 500 HP and are located at an area source, and 
stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 HP and are located at a major 
source. These are large sources that are subject to proposed standards that would require the use

NSCR must maintain the catalyst so that the pressure drop across the catalyst does not change by 
more than 2 inches of water from the pressure drop across the catalyst that was measured during 
the initial performance test.

Limit concentration of CO in the stationary RICE exhaust

Owners and operators of these engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary 
RICE exhaust so that the catalyst inlet temperature is between 450 and 1350 degrees Fahrenheit 
(°F) for engines with an oxidation catalyst and 750 to 1250°F for engines with NSCR. Owners 
and operators of engines that are not using oxidation catalyst or NSCR must comply with any 
operating limitations approved by the Administrator. 
 As shown in Table 4-2 above, the EPA is also proposing management practices for 
several subcategories of engines located at area sources. Such management practices include 
maintenance requirements that are expected to ensure that emission control systems are working 
properly. EPA asks for comments on these management practices and requests suggestions of 
additional maintenance requirements that may be needed for some of these engine subcategories.

4.2.4 What Are the Requirements for Demonstrating Compliance? 
The following sections describe the requirements for demonstrating compliance under the 
proposed rule. 
4.2.4.1   Stationary RICE at Major Sources  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are less than 100 hp and stationary emergency RICE located at major sources must operate and 
maintain their stationary RICE and aftertreatment control device (if any) according to the 
manufacturer’s emission-related written instructions or develop their own maintenance plan. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are less 
than 100 hp and stationary emergency RICE located at major sources do not have to conduct any 
performance testing.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are greater than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp must conduct an initial 
performance test to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that 
are greater than 500 hp must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 8,760 hours 
of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are achieving the 
required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp 
and are located at a major source must continuously monitor and record the catalyst inlet 
temperature if an oxidation catalyst is being used on the engine. The pressure drop across the 
catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation catalyst is not being used on the engine, 
the owner or operator must continuously monitor and record the operating parameters (if any)

4.2.4.2  Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
Owners and operators of stationary emergency RICE located at existing area sources and 
stationary RICE that are located at existing area sources that are not subject to any numerical 
emission standards, as shown in Table 4-2, must operate and maintain their stationary RICE and 
after-treatment control device (if any) according to the manufacturer’s emission-related written 
instructions or develop their own maintenance plan. Owners and operators of stationary RICE 
that are located at existing area sources that are not subject to any numerical emission standards 
do not have to conduct any performance testing.

Owners and operators of stationary RICE that are located at existing area sources subject 
to numerical emission standards, as shown in Table 4-2, must conduct an initial performance test 
to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency RICE located at existing area sources 
that are greater than 500 hp must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 8,760 
hours of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are achieving the 
required emission standards. 
In addition to emission standards and management practices, certain stationary CI RICE 
located at existing area sources are subject to fuel requirements.  These fuel requirements are 
proposed in order to reduce the potential formation of sulfate compounds that are emitted when 
high sulfur diesel fuel is used in combination with oxidation catalysts and to assist in the efficient 
operation of the oxidation catalysts. Thus, owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 
diesel-fueled CI engines greater than 300 HP with a displacement of less than 30 liters per 
cylinder located at existing area sources must only use diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 
CFR 80.510(b), which requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm and 
either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent.  
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE 
that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source must continuously monitor and 
record the catalyst inlet temperature if an oxidation catalyst or NSCR is being used on the 
engine. The pressure drop across the catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation 
catalyst or NSCR is not being used on the engine, the owner or operator must continuously 
monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.5 What Are the Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements? 
The following sections describe the reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are 
required under the proposed rule. 
Owners and operators of stationary emergency RICE that do not meet the requirements 
for non-emergency engines are required to keep records of their hours of operation. Owners and 
operators of stationary emergency RICE must install a non-resettable hour meter on their engines 
to record the necessary information. Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for the 
purpose of maintenance checks and readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended 
by the Federal, State or local government, the manufacturer, the vendor, or the insurance

company associated with the engine. Maintenance checks and readiness testing of such units is 
limited to 100 hours per year. Owners and operators can petition the Administrator for additional 
hours, beyond the allowed 100 hours per year, if such additional hours should prove to be 
necessary for maintenance and testing reasons. A petition is not required if the hours beyond 100 
hours per year for maintenance and testing purposes are mandated by regulation such as State or 
local requirements. There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary engines in 
emergency situations, however, the owner or operator is required to record the length of 
operation and the reason the engine was in operation during that time. Records must be 
maintained documenting why the engine was operating to ensure the 100 hours per year limit for 
maintenance and testing operation is not exceeded. In addition, owners and operators are allowed 
to operate their stationary emergency RICE for non-emergency purposes for 50 hours per year, 
but those 50 hours are counted towards the total 100 hours provided for operation other than for 
true emergencies and owners and operators may not engage in income-generating activities 
during those 50 hours. The 50 hours per year for non-emergency purposes cannot be used to 
generate income for a facility, for example, to supply power to an electric grid or otherwise 
supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE located at area sources, that are subject 
to management practices as shown in Table 4-2, are required to keep records that show that 
management practices that are required are being met.  Such records are to be kept on-site by 
owners and operators.  These records must include, but may not be limited to: oil and filter 
change dates, oil amounts added and corresponding hour on the hour meter, fuel consumption 
rates, air filter change dates, records of repairs and other maintenance performed. 
In terms of reporting requirements, owners and operators of existing stationary RICE, 
except stationary RICE that are less than 100 hp, existing emergency stationary RICE, and 
existing stationary RICE that are not subject to any numerical emission standards, must submit 
all of the applicable notifications as listed in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A), including initial an initial notification, notification of performance test, and a 
notification of compliance for each stationary RICE which must comply with the specified 
emission limitations.  
4.3 Rationale for Proposed Rule 
4.3.1    Which Control Technologies Apply to Stationary RICE? 
EPA reviewed various control technologies applicable to stationary engines. For detailed 
information on the control technology review that EPA conducted, refer to information in the

 4-15 
docket for this proposed rule. The following sections provide general descriptions of currently 
available controls that can be used to reduce emissions from stationary engines. 
Non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) has been commercially available for many 
years and has been widely used on stationary engines. The technology can be applied to rich 
burn stationary engines and is capable of significantly reducing HAP emissions from stationary 
RICE. The technology is also capable of considerably reducing CO and NOx emissions from rich 
burn stationary RICE. Based on available information, NSCR appears to be technically feasible 
for rich burn engines down to 25 hp. 
Oxidation catalyst is another type of aftertreatment that can be applied to stationary 
engines and is typically used with lean burn engines. The technology can be applied to either 
diesel or gas fired lean burn engines. Significant reductions in HAP and CO are achieved with 
oxidation catalyst and applying the technology to diesel fired engines also yields PM emissions 
reductions. Oxidation catalyst control has been widely used and has been available for decades 
for use with lean burn stationary engines. While oxidation catalysts are very effective at reducing 
HAP and CO emissions, there is some concern about increasing NO2 emissions as a result of 
using highly catalyzed devices. Thus, EPA requests comments and information on the potential 
increase in NO2 emissions and any strategies to help reduce their formation. 
Catalyzed diesel particulate filters (CDPF) are applicable to CI engines using diesel fuel 
and are primarily used to reduce PM emissions.  Applying CDPF can significantly reduce PM 
emissions, while also limiting emissions of HAP and CO. Catalyzed diesel particulate filters are 
the basis for the Tier 4 emission standards for PM for most nonroad CI engines regulated by 40 
CFR part 1039 and also for most new non-emergency stationary CI engines regulated under 40 
CFR part 60, subpart IIII. Recently finalized standards for stationary CI engines in California are 
also based on the use of particulate filters in some cases. 
4.3.2  How Did EPA Determine the Basis and Level of the Proposed Standards? 
4.3.2.1  Stationary RICE at Major Sources 
Section 112 of the CAA requires that EPA establish NESHAP for the control of HAP 
from new and existing sources in regulated source categories. The CAA requires the NESHAP 
for major sources to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP that is 
achievable. This level of control is commonly referred to as the MACT.

The MACT floor is the minimum control level allowed for NESHAP and is defined 
under section 112(d)(3) of the CAA. In essence, the MACT floor ensures that the standards are 
set at a level that assures that all major sources achieve the level of control at least as stringent as 
that already achieved by the better controlled and lower emitting sources in each source category 
or subcategory. 
The MACT floor standards for existing sources must be no less stringent than the average 
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of existing sources in the category or 
subcategory (or the best performing 5 sources for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 
sources). The MACT standard must be no less stringent than the MACT floor.  
In developing MACT, EPA also considers control options that are more stringent than the 
floor. EPA may establish standards more stringent than the floor (or, “beyond-the-floor”) based 
on the consideration of cost of achieving the emissions reductions, any non-air quality health and 
environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Section 112 of the CAA allows EPA to 
establish subcategories among a group of sources, based on criteria that differentiate such 
sources. The subcategories that have been developed for stationary RICE were previously listed 
and are necessary in order to capture the distinct differences, which could affect the emissions of 
HAP from these engines. The complete rationale explaining the development of these 
subcategories is provided in the memorandum titled “Subcategorization and MACT Floor 
Determination for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines ≤500 hp at Major 
Sources” and is available from the docket.  
For the MACT floor determination, EPA reviewed the data in its Office of Air Quality 
Planning and Standards’ RICE Population Database (hereafter referred to as the “Population 
Database”) and RICE Emissions Database (hereafter referred to as the “Emissions Database”). 
The Population and Emissions Databases represent the best information available to EPA. 
Information in the Population and Emissions Database was obtained from several sources and is 
further described in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the RICE NESHAP for engines 
greater than 500 hp at major sources (67 FR 77830, December 19, 2002) and in the docket for 
the RICE NESHAP rulemaking (EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0059). EPA queried the Population 
Database to determine how many stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 hp in each 
subcategory have catalyst type controls to determine the relevant technology for the MACT 
floor. In order to establish the emission standard for each subcategory of stationary existing 
RICE, EPA referred to the Emissions Database. The following sections describe the MACT floor 
review and proposed MACT determinations for each subcategory of stationary RICE. 
Deleted: OMB Review Draft – 
February 23, 2009
 4-17 
a. Stationary RICE <50 hp. According to the Population Database there are no existing 
stationary RICE less than 50 hp using catalyst type controls. Therefore, EPA determined that the 
MACT floor is the emission level that is achievable by existing engines of this size operating 
without add-on controls. EPA is not expecting any stationary CI engines less than 50 hp since 
such engines are typically considered nonroad mobile engines. Also, EPA does not expect any 
lean burn engines in this subcategory as lean burn engines tend to be found in larger engine size 
segments. Therefore, EPA believes that engines less than 50 hp would be 4SRB engines. 
Subsequently, EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions from 4SRB engines and averaged the best 
performing 12% without add-on controls. As a result, the MACT floor for engines below 50 hp 
is 2 parts per million by volume, dry basis (ppmvd) of formaldehyde at 15% oxygen (O2). 
EPA considered regulatory options more stringent than the MACT floor, specifically 
NSCR. However, the cost per ton of HAP reduced for engines less than 50 hp equipped with 
NSCR is substantial,  particularly when considered the potential HAP reductions that would be 
expected. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor. For details on the cost per ton 
analysis, refer to the memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary 
RICE,” included in the docket.  
b. Stationary Landfill/Digester Gas ≥50 hp. According to the Population Database 
there are no existing landfill or digester gas engines using catalyst type controls. Therefore, EPA 
determined that the MACT floor for this subcategory is the level achievable by existing landfill 
and digester gas engines operating without add-on controls. EPA consulted several sources, 
including the Emissions Database, in order to determine the level being achieved by the best 
performing 12 percent of landfill and digester gas engines.  
Based on reviewing recently obtained test reports for landfill and digester gas engines, 
EPA concluded that the latest information obtained on the current levels being achieved by 
landfill gas engines is the most appropriate and representative information and therefore was 
used to determine the MACT floor limit. EPA analyzed the CO emissions from landfill and 
digester gas test reports. EPA has previously discussed the appropriateness of using CO 
emissions as a surrogate for HAP emissions and therefore reviewed CO emissions from landfill 
and digester gas engines without add-on controls. EPA selected the best performing 12% and 
averaged those 12% to determine the MACT floor. As a result, the MACT floor for landfill and 
digester gas stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp is 177 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
Currently, there are no viable above-the-floor options for engines that combust landfill or 
digester gas. Aftertreatment controls could theoretically be applied to engines burning waste gas;

however, numerous studies have shown that a family of silicon-based compounds named 
siloxanes can foul add-on catalyst controls. Such fouling can render the catalyst inoperable 
within short periods of time. Pre-treatment systems could be applied to clean the fuel prior to 
combustion theoretically allowing catalysts to be used, but has not shown to be a reliable 
technology at this time. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor.  
c. Stationary Emergency CI 50≥hp≤500.  EPA reviewed CO emissions from CI engines 
without add-on controls and selected the best performing 12% without add-on controls. As a 
result, the MACT floor for CI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less 
than or equal to 500 hp is 40 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
As part of the analysis to consider beyond-the-floor options, EPA considered add-on 
controls for emergency engines. However, due to the limited operation of emergency engines 
(about 50 hours per year on average), the cost per ton of HAP removed by such controls is high. 
The estimated cost of oxidation catalyst per ton of HAP reduced ranges from $1 million to $2.8 
million for emergency CI engines in this size range. For CDPF, the estimated cost per ton of 
HAP reduced for emergency CI engines between 50 and 500 HP ranges from $3.7 million to 
$8.7 million. In addition, the total reductions achieved by applying aftertreatment controls would 
be minimal since stationary emergency engines are operated only an average of about 50 hours 
per year. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor. EPA’s analysis of regulatory 
alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor 
Determination for Stationary RICE.” 
d. Stationary Non-Emergency CI 50≥hp≤500.. As a result of our review of the 
Emissions Database , the MACT floor for CI non-emergency stationary RICE greater than or 
equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 40 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
As part of analysis of going beyond the MACT floor,EPA considered add-on controls for 
this subcategory of engines. The applicable add-on controls that yield significant HAP reductions 
are oxidation catalyst and CDPF. Diesel oxidation catalysts are capable of reducing HAP 
emissions by significant amounts in excess of 90% in some cases. Diesel oxidation catalysts also 
reduce emissions of CO as well as PM emissions. Achievable reductions of PM are on the order 
of 30% for oxidation catalyst. Catalyzed diesel particulate filters are capable of reducing HAP 
and CO emissions by similar amounts, but are more efficient in reducing PM. Achievable PM 
reductions are on the order of 90% or more with CDPF. However, CDPF is considerably more 
expensive than diesel oxidation catalysts.

EPA estimated the cost per ton of HAP removal by potentially applying oxidation 
catalysts and CDPF to existing non-emergency CI engines. The specific costs associated with 
add-on controls can be found in memoranda available from the rulemaking docket. The cost per 
ton of HAP removed for CDPF is in general significantly higher than the cost per ton of HAP 
removed for oxidation catalyst, but the cost per ton for both options dramatically increases as the 
size of the engine decreases and is more favorable towards larger size engines. EPA requests data 
and other information on the ability of oxidation catalysts to remove HAP compared to CDPF.  
In addition, we request comment on the performance capability of these control devices to 
remove metallic HAP.   
Considering the HAP emission reductions capable from oxidation catalysts, the cost of 
oxidation catalyst control compared to CDPF, and the low capital costs associated with oxidation 
catalyst make oxidation catalysts a favorable option for reduction of HAP emissions from larger 
existing non-emergency stationary diesel engines.  However, going above-the-floor and requiring 
oxidation catalyst on all non-emergency stationary CI engines would require significant total 
capital investment and total annual control costs. For the greater than 300 hp segment the cost 
per ton removed, which includes a mixture of organic and metallic HAP, is estimated to be 
$51,973.  This cost is almost a third less than the estimated cost per ton of $140,395 for 
stationary engines 50 to 100 hp.  
Stationary existing diesel engines were largely uncontrolled at the Federal level prior to 
the promulgation of EPA’s emission standards for stationary diesel engines in 2004, which 
affected engines constructed beginning in 2002. Non-emergency diesel engines are estimated to 
emit 90% of total combined PM and NOx emissions from all existing stationary diesel engines, 
with emergency engines emitting the remaining 10%. Of the non-emergency diesel engines, 
about 50,000 non-emergency engines rated 300 hp or higher were built prior to 2002, which is 
about 29% of the existing population of non-emergency stationary diesel engines. These 50,000 
non-emergency diesel engines emit approximately 72% of the total HAP emissions, 66% of the 
total PM emissions, and 62% of the total NOx emissions from existing non-emergency stationary 
diesel engines. This information is based on data from the Power Systems Research Database 
that was presented in Tables 1-4 of EPA’s January 24, 2008 ANPRM for stationary diesel 
engines emission standards (73 FR 4136).  
For these reasons, EPA concluded that it can achieve the highest level of emission 
reduction relative to cost, while requiring controls where appropriate, by requiring more stringent 
emission standards on non-emergency stationary diesel engines with a power rating greater than 
300 hp. For these reasons and considering the higher level of HAP reductions achievable from

 4-20 
engines greater than 300 hp and the reduced annual cost of control, EPA believes that requiring 
above-the-floor levels that rely on oxidation catalyst control is appropriate for engines greater 
than 300 hp. EPA solicits comments and data on whether 300 hp is the appropriate size division 
for setting beyond-the-floor MACT standards requiring the use of add-on controls.  Specifically, 
EPA is soliciting comment on whether it would be appropriate to extend the more stringent 
standards to engines that are less than 300 hp.   
Of further consideration are the co-benefits that would be achieved by the use of 
oxidation catalyst as it will reduce other pollutants such as CO and PM,.   Taking into account 
the reductions in CO and PM associated with applying oxidation catalyst to non-emergency CI 
engines, the cost per ton of pollutants reduced if one sums the reductions together decreases. The 
total co-benefits of this proposed regulation are presented in a separate memorandum titled 
““Impacts Associated with NESHAP for Existing Stationary RICE,” which provides the costs 
and emissions impacts of this regulation. These emission estimates are also summarized later in 
this RIA chapter. 
EPA believes that the emission reductions associated with use of oxidation catalysts, 
taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified under section 112(d). Therefore, EPA 
is proposing MACT to be the level that is achieved by applying oxidation catalyst to non-
emergency CI engines greater than 300 HP, which is 4 ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2, or 90 
percent CO efficiency. A fuller discussion of EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives above-
the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for 
Stationary RICE.” 
While these proposed HAP emission standards would not require the use of CDPFs, EPA 
notes that when compared to oxidation catalysts, CDPFs provide significantly greater reductions 
in levels of PM from diesel engines, which are a significant health concern. PM emissions from 
these engines contain several constituents, including black carbon and trace amounts of metallic 
HAP.  EPA estimates that the range of PM2.5 emission reductions would increase from 2,600 
tons to 7,600 tons if CDPFs are used rather than oxidation catalysts.

regulatory and non-regulatory approaches that could help address black carbon emissions from 
existing stationary diesel engines. 
Sources may wish to review whether it is appropriate for some existing CI engines to use 
CDPFs to meet the requirements of this rule, given the considerable co-benefits of using CDPF.   
For example, the cost effectiveness associated with reducing PM2.5 with oxidation catalysts on a 
300 HP diesel engine is $27,000 per ton, while using a CDPF improves the cost effectiveness to 
about $9,000 per ton.  These cost effectiveness numbers include any potential reductions of 
metallic HAP which would be emitted in the particle phase.  EPA notes, however, that some 
have suggested that the use of CDPF on older uncontrolled engines may be more problematic 
than for newer engines that already have some level of engine control. 
One of the potential problems raised by industry are the difficulties with retrofitting 
CDPFs on mechanically-controlled engines versus those that use electronic controls. 
Furthermore, the diesel PM levels from older engines are, according to some, too high for 
efficient operation of a CDPF. EPA is requesting comment on the use of CDPF to meet the HAP 
standards for this rule and on the benefits generally of using CDPFs on older stationary CI 
engines. EPA also asks for comment on technical feasibility issues that might preclude the use of 
such devices on older diesel engines. 
Stationary diesel engines also emit trace amounts of metallic HAP.  EPA believes that 
formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total HAP, including these very small trace 
emissions of metals.  Nonetheless, EPA is taking comment on whether there are more 
appropriate surrogates for metallic HAP from stationary diesel engines.  EPA does not have data 
regarding the use of other surrogates for these emissions from stationary diesel engines, so EPA 
is soliciting data on any other such surrogates. 
The proposed rule requires the use of ULSD for existing non-emergency stationary diesel 
engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder. The use of 
ULSD is necessary due to concerns about oxidation catalysts simultaneously oxidizing SO2 to 
form sulfate particulate. A limit on the diesel fuel sulfur level of 15 ppm will reduce the potential 
for increased sulfate emissions from diesel engines equipped with oxidation catalysts and will 
improve the efficiency of the catalyst. The use of ULSD will also enable stationary diesel

engines to utilize CDPF if desired. EPA has already promulgated similar diesel fuel sulfur 
standards for highway and nonroad diesel engines and for new stationary diesel engines. 
e. Stationary Non-Emergency CI >500 hp.  A regulation covering existing stationary 
diesel engines was promulgated in 2004. However, based on the MACT floor analysis conducted 
at that time, the regulation subjected diesel engines greater than 500 hp at major sources to 
emission standards of no further emission control. 
However, due to the availability of technically feasible and reasonably cost-effective 
technologies to control emissions from these existing large stationary CI engines, and the 
potential of reducing exhaust HAP (as well as PM), EPA is proposing to address HAP emissions 
from these existing diesel engines > 500 HP pursuant to its authority under CAA section 112(d). 
As a result of our review of the Emissions Database, the MACT floor for CI non-
emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 40 
ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of our analysis of going beyond the MACT floor, EPA considered the emissions 
associated with the use of oxidation catalysts. Similar to EPA’s analysis of the emission 
reductions and costs associated with the use of oxidation catalysts for diesel engines from 300-
500 HP, EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use of oxidation catalysts, 
taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified under section 112(d). A fuller 
discussion of EPA’s analysis of regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the 
memorandum entitled “Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.”  
EPA is proposing to address emissions from existing non-emergency CI engines greater 
than 500 HP located at major sources by limiting the CO to 4 ppmvd at 15 percent O2 or by 
reducing CO by 90 percent or more. The proposed standards are based on what is achieved by 
applying oxidation catalyst controls. Oxidation catalyst controls reduce HAP, CO, and PM from 
diesel engines. The proposed emission standard is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be 
an appropriate surrogate for HAP.  Stationary diesel engines also emit trace amounts of metallic 
HAP.  EPA believes that formaldehyde and CO are reasonable surrogates for total HAP, 
including these very small trace emissions of metals.  Nonetheless, EPA is taking comment on 
whether there are more appropriate surrogates for metallic HAP from stationary diesel engines.  
EPA does not have data regarding the use of other surrogates for these emissions from stationary 
diesel engines, so EPA is soliciting data on any other such surrogates.

on what is achievable by

For the same reasons provided above for non-emergency diesel engines between 300-500 
HP, EPA is requiring the use of ULSD for non-emergency diesel engines above 500 HP.  
f. Stationary Emergency SI 50≥hp≤500. As a result of our review of the Emissions 
Database and industry estimates, EPA determined the MACT floor for SI emergency stationary 
RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 2 ppmvd of 
formaldehyde at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered add-on controls for 
this subcategory. However, the same issues apply to emergency SI engines as to emergency CI 
engines; in particular, the cost-effectiveness of such controls on emergency engines and 
questions about the feasibility of such controls on emergency engines. According to the 
Population Database there are no SI emergency stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP 
and less than or equal to 500 HP using catalyst type controls. Therefore, it is not appropriate to 
require add-on controls on emergency SI engines. EPA also found no other techniques 
appropriate to go beyond the MACT floor. MACT is therefore equivalent to the MACT floor. 
g. Stationary Non-Emergency 2SLB 50≥HP≤500. EPA selected the best performing 12 
percent of engines for formaldehyde, identified the corresponding CO tests, and averaged the CO 
emissions from the corresponding tests. As a result, the MACT floor for non-emergency 2SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 85 ppmvd of 
CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst controls to this subcategory and estimated the cost per ton of HAP removed. EPA 
believes the costs to be reasonable for engines 250 HP and above equipped with oxidation 
catalyst and can be justified in light of the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved. 
For example, the cost effectiveness of reducing HAP from 2SLB engines in the 300 to 500 HP 
size range is about $2,900 per ton.  Oxidation catalysts can reduce HAP and CO from 
stationary spark-ignition engines by approximately 90 percent.  The Emissions Database did not 
indicate any other proven and cost-effective control technologies or other methods that can 
reduce HAP emissions from 2SLB engines to levels lower than those achieved by oxidation 
catalysts. The proposed emission limit is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be an 
appropriate surrogate for HAP. EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use 
of oxidation catalysts, taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified. Therefore, 
MACT for engines 250 HP and above is the level that is achievable by applying oxidation

catalyst and is 8 ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2 or 90 percent CO efficiency. MACT for engines 
below 250 HP is equivalent to the MACT floor. 
g. Non-Emergency 2SLB 50≥hp≤500. According to the Population Database, there are 
no non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or equal 
to 249 HP using catalyst type controls.  
EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions tests from 4SLB engines. EPA selected the best 
performing 12 percent of engines for formaldehyde and identified the corresponding CO values 
from the top 12 tests for formaldehyde. The corresponding CO values were then averaged. As a 
result, the MACT floor for 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 HP and less than or 
equal to 249 HP is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst controls to this subcategory. However the cost per ton of HAP removed was determined 
to be too significant and to outweigh the expected HAP reductions from these stationary engines. 
Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor. 
h. Non-Emergency 4SLB 50≥hp≤249. According to the Population Database, there are 
no non-emergency 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 
249 hp using catalyst type controls. Therefore, the MACT floor for this subcategory is the level 
achieved by 4SLB engines 50 to 249 hp operating without add-on controls. 
EPA reviewed formaldehyde emissions tests from 4SLB engines without add-on controls. 
EPA selected the best performing 12% of engines for formaldehyde and identified the 
corresponding CO values from the top 12 tests for formaldehyde. The corresponding CO values 
were then averaged. As a result, the MACT floor for 4SLB stationary RICE greater than or equal 
to 50 hp and less than or equal to 249 hp is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15% O2. 
EPA considered applying oxidation catalyst controls to this subcategory as part of the 
beyond-the-floor analysis. However, the cost per ton of HAP removed was determined to 
outweigh the potential reductions. Therefore, MACT is equivalent to the MACT floor. 
i. Non-Emergency 4SLB 250≥hp≤500. For non-emergency 4SLB engines between 250 
and 500 hp, EPA found that 5.7% of the population is controlled with aftertreatment that yields 
HAP reductions, particularly oxidation catalysts. EPA analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 
4SLB tests for engines without add-on controls. EPA took the average of the best performing 
12% of engines for formaldehyde and identified the corresponding CO values from the best

performing 12% of tests. The corresponding CO values were then averaged. The result for 4SLB 
stationary RICE greater than or equal to 250 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 95 ppmvd of 
CO at 15% O2. 
As part of EPA’s beyond-the-floor MACT analysis, EPA considered applying oxidation 
catalyst and estimated the cost per ton of HAP removed. The use of oxidation catalysts on these 
engines can achieve 90 percent HAP reductions. EPA concluded that the control costs associated 
with installing oxidation catalysts are reasonable for this type of stationary engine, and thus can 
be justified considering the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved by using 
oxidation catalysts. Oxidation catalysts can reduce HAP and CO from stationary spark-ignition 
engines. The proposed emission limit is in terms of CO, which has been shown to be an 
appropriate surrogate for HAP. EPA believes the HAP emission reductions associated with use 
of oxidation catalysts, taking into account the costs of such controls, are justified. The Emissions 
Database did not indicate any other proven and cost-effective control technologies or other 
methods that can reduce HAP emissions from 4SLB engines to levels lower than those achieved 
by oxidation catalysts.   
EPA determined that the appropriate numerical MACT level could be determined by 
analyzing uncontrolled levels of HAP and reducing the levels by the expected reductions from 
oxidation catalysts. EPA analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 4SLB tests for engines without 
add-on controls. EPA took the average of the best performing 12 percent of engines for 
formaldehyde and identified the corresponding CO values from the best performing 12 percent 
of tests. The corresponding CO values were then averaged. The result for 4SLB stationary RICE 
greater than or equal to 250 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP is 95 ppmvd of CO at 15 
percent O2. 
Given an expected 90 percent reduction from the use of oxidation catalysts, MACT is 9 
ppmvd of CO at 15 percent O2 or 90 percent CO efficiency. A fuller discussion of EPA’s 
analysis of regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled 
“Above-the-Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.” 
 
j. Non-Emergency 4SRB 50≥hp≤500. For SI non-emergency stationary 4SRB engines

population are using catalyst type controls, according to the Population Database. The add-on 
controls that apply to this subcategory of engines is NSCR.    
As part of the beyond-the-floor analysis, EPA considered the application of NSCR to this 
engine subcategory. The Emissions Database provided no other proven and cost effective 
emission control methods currently available which can reduce HAP emissions from 4SRB 
engines to levels lower than that achieved through NSCR control.  
 
The technology is proven, has been applied to thousands of rich burn engines, and is 
efficient at reducing HAP emissions. EPA considered applying NSCR and estimated the cost per 
ton of HAP removed. EPA believes the costs are reasonable and appropriate and can be justified 
considering the significant reductions of HAP that would be achieved by using NSCR on this 
subcategory of engines. For example, the cost effectiveness of reducing HAP from stationary 
4SRB engines in the 300 to 500 HP size range is about $5,000 per ton. 
 
Other pollutants are also reduced through the use of NSCR including significant 
reductions in NOx and CO emissions. Taking into consideration the emission reductions 
achieved by applying NSCR to 4SRB engines greater than 50 hp, the cost per ton of emissions 
reduced is favorable for this type of stationary engines. A fuller discussion of EPA’s analysis of 
regulatory alternatives above-the-floor is presented in the memorandum entitled “Above-the-
Floor Determination for Stationary RICE.” 
 
EPA determined that the appropriate numerical MACT level could be determined by 
analyzing uncontrolled levels of HAP and reducing the levels by the expected reductions from 
NSCR. EPA analyzed formaldehyde emissions from 4SRB engines without add-on controls and 
averaged the emissions from the best performing 12% of engines. The result for 4SRB stationary 
RICE greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp is 2 ppmvd of formaldehyde 
at 15% O2. 
Therefore, MACT is the level that is achievable by applying NSCR and is 200 ppbvd of 
formaldehyde at 15% O2 or 90% formaldehyde efficiency.

4.4 Engines at Area Sources  
Under section 112(k) of the CAA, EPA developed a national strategy to address air toxic 
pollution from area sources. The strategy is part of EPA’s overall national effort to reduce toxics, 
but focuses on the particular needs of urban areas. Section 112(k) requires EPA to list area 
source categories and to ensure 90% of the emissions from area sources are subject to standards 
pursuant to section 112(d) of the CAA. Under section 112(k), the CAA specifically mandated 
that EPA develop a strategy to address public health risks posed by air toxics from area sources 
in urban areas. Section 112(k) also mandates that the strategy achieve a 75% reduction in cancer 
incidence attributable to HAP emitted by stationary sources. As mentioned, stationary RICE are 
listed as a source category under the Urban Air Toxics Strategy developed under the authority of 
sections 112(k) and 112(c)(3) of the CAA. These area sources are subject to standards under 
section 112(d).  
Section 112(d)(5) of the CAA indicates that EPA may elect to promulgate standards or 
requirements to area sources “which provide for the use of generally available control 
technologies or management practices by such sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air 
pollutants.” For determining emission limitations, GACT standards can be more flexible 
requirements than MACT standards. For example, the CAA provisions for setting GACT do not 
require setting a control baseline or “floor” that is equal to the average emission levels achieved 
by the best performing 12% of a type of facility, for existing sources, or the emission control 
achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, for new sources. EPA is permitted to 
consider costs and other factors during each phase of the GACT analysis. Control technology 
options available to stationary RICE located at area sources are the same as those discussed for 
engines located at major sources. 
The requirements being proposed in this action are applicable to stationary RICE located 
at area sources of HAP emissions. EPA has chosen to propose national requirements, which not 
only focus on urban areas, but address emissions from area sources in all areas (urban and rural). 
For stationary RICE, it would not be practical or appropriate to limit the applicability to 
urban areas and EPA has determined that national standards are appropriate. Stationary RICE are 
located in both urban and rural areas. In fact, there are some rural areas with high concentrations 
of stationary RICE. Stationary RICE are employed in various industries used for both the private 
and public sector for a wide range of applications such as generator sets, irrigation sets, air and 
gas compressors, pumps, welders, and hydro power units. Stationary RICE may be used by 
private entities for agricultural purposes and be located in a rural area, or it may be used as a

standby generator for an office building located in an urban area. Other stationary RICE may 
operate at large sources for electric power generation, transmission, or distribution purposes. 
In previous rulemakings, EPA had determined that stationary RICE are located all over 
the U.S., and EPA cannot say that these sources are more prevalent in certain areas of the 
country. Therefore, for the source category of stationary RICE, EPA is proposing national 
requirements without a distinction between urban and non-urban areas. However, EPA would 
like to ask for comment on this approach, which does not distinguish between urban and rural 
areas, in order to determine whether it continues to be valid for today’s population of stationary 
RICE. 
For subcategories of larger engines, particularly those above 500 hp and those for which 
EPA has based MACT on the use of add-on controls, the proposed GACT requirement for area 
sources is equal to MACT for similar engines at major sources. The control technologies that 
create the basis for the emission standards for engines located at major sources are readily 
available and feasible for all engines. Further, for those cases where EPA is basing the MACT 
emission standards on add-on controls, EPA determined that costs associated with implementing 
HAP-reducing technologies are reasonable and justified. Hence, there is no reason why GACT 
should be any different than MACT for larger engines located at area sources. Consequently, 
EPA has determined that for area sources that are non-emergency 2SLB engines greater than or 
equal to 250 hp, non-emergency 4SLB engines greater than or equal to 250 hp, non-emergency 
4SRB greater than or equal to 50 hp, emergency CI engines greater than 500 hp, non-emergency 
CI engines greater than 300 hp, landfill and digester gas engines greater than 500 hp, and 
emergency SI engines greater than 500 hp, GACT is equal to MACT. 
As discussed, GACT provides EPA more flexibility in setting requirements than MACT 
and can include available control technologies or management practices to reduce HAP 
emissions. EPA has determined that for area sources that are non-emergency 2SLB engines 
greater than or equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, non-emergency 4SLB engines greater than or 
equal to 50 hp and less than 250 hp, emergency CI engines greater than or equal to 50 hp and 
less than or equal to 500 hp, non-emergency CI engines greater than or equal to 50 hp and less 
than or equal to 300 hp, engines less than 50 hp, landfill and digester gas engines greater than or 
equal to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp, and emergency SI engines greater than or equal 
to 50 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp, EPA proposes that GACT is management practices.  
Management practices include requiring owners and operators to operate and maintain their 
stationary RICE and aftertreatment control device (if any) according to the manufacturer’s

February 23, 2009
 4-29 
emission-related written instructions. Alternatively, owners and operators may develop their own 
maintenance plans to follow. Owners and operators using such maintenance plans must, to the 
extent practicable, maintain and operate the engine in a manner consistent with good air 
pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Add-on controls are feasible for some 
engines located at area sources, but control costs are high and EPA believes that it is possible to 
achieve reasonable controls using management practices. For example, capital costs associated 
with installing an oxidation catalyst on a 200 HP diesel engine are about $2,100 with annual 
costs of $700.  Such costs are significant particularly when one considers that the cost per ton of 
this option is on the order of $72,000 per ton of HAP reduced.  Considering the high cost per ton 
of HAP reduced, it is difficult to justify requiring add-on controls on these engines. 
EPA is also attempting to minimize the burden of the proposed rule, specifically on small 
businesses and individual owners and operators. EPA does not believe that management 
practices would be a substantial burden on owners and operators such as private owners and 
small entities.  
4.5.  Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction Limits 
 With respect to the exemption from emission standards during periods of Startup, 
Shutdown and Malfunction in the General Provisions (see, e.g., 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1)(exemption 
from non-opacity emission standards) and (h)(1)(exemption from opacity and visible emission 
standards)), we note that on December 19, 2008, in a decision addressing a challenge to the 
2002, 2004 and 2006 amendments to those provisions, the Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit vacated the SSM exemption. Sierra Club v. EPA 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 
25578 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 19, 2008).  We are still evaluating the recent court decision, and the time 
for appeal of that decision has not yet run.  However, in light of the court decision, EPA is 
proposing not to apply the SSM exemption for non-opacity standards set forth in 40 CFR § 
63.6(f)(1) to this NESHAP.  The SSM exemption for opacity and visible emissions standards in 
40 CFR § 63.6(h)(1) is not relevant here because the standards proposed in this action do not 
constitute opacity or visible emission standards.   
 EPA recognizes that there are different modes of operation for any stationary source, and 
those modes generally include start-up, normal operations, shut-down, and malfunctions.  EPA 
does not believe that emissions should be different during periods of shutdown compared to

normal operations, but EPA does believe that emissions will likely be different during periods of 
startup and malfunction, particularly for engines relying on catalytic controls. 
 EPA is proposing two options in this action for subcategories where the proposed 
emission standard is based on the use of catalytic controls.  The first option is to have the same 
standards apply during both normal operation and periods of startup and malfunctions.  While 
EPA is aware of the general properties of engine catalytic controls, our Emissions Database has 
no specific data showing that emissions during periods of startup and malfunction are different 
than during normal operation.  Furthermore, EPA does not have substantial information 
regarding the specific parameters (e.g. timing, temperature) of such differences in emissions.   
 Although we lack specific data on emissions during start-up and malfunction, EPA 
recognizes that emissions are likely to differ during these periods for engines relying on catalytic 
controls.  Accordingly, for subcategories where the proposed emission standard is based on the 
use of catalytic controls, EPA is also co-proposing emission limitations that would apply to 
stationary RICE during periods of startup and malfunction in order to account for the different 
emissions characteristics of stationary internal combustion engines during startup and 
malfunction periods, compared to other periods of operation.   
 During startup operation with an OC, engine exhaust temperatures must reach about 250 
to 300 degrees C in order to work effectively.  In the case of NSCR, exhaust gas temperatures 
must reach between 425 to 650 degrees C in order to work effectively.   It can take about 15 to 
30 minutes of operation – depending on engine size – for exhaust temperatures to reach those 
temperature levels.  Thus, for the subcategories of stationary RICE discussed above where the 
proposed emission standard is based on the use of catalytic controls, EPA is co-proposing that 
the standards during periods of startup and malfunction will be based on emissions expected 
from the best controlled sources prior to the full warm-up of the catalytic control.    
Under either co-proposal, for the subcategories of stationary RICE discussed above 
where the proposed emission limitations during normal operation are not based on the use of 
oxidation catalyst or NSCR, we are proposing the same emission limitations during startup and 
malfunction as during periods of normal operation.    
For more information on these startup, shutdown, and malfunction options, please refer to  
the preamble.

4.6   How Did EPA Determine the Compliance Requirements? 
EPA discussed the specific compliance requirements that are being proposed earlier in 
this chapter. In general, EPA has attempted to reduce the burden on affected owners and 
operators. The following presents the rationale for the proposed compliance requirements. 
Stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are less than 100 hp, 
stationary RICE located at area sources that are not subject to numerical emission standards, and 
all stationary emergency RICE are only subject to minimal compliance requirements in the form 
of management practices to minimize emissions and are not subject to performance testing. EPA 
does not believe that following the manufacturer’s instructions is a burdensome requirement, and 
it is expected that most owners and operators are already doing so. It is in the owner’s best 
interest to operate and maintain the engine and aftertreatment device (if one is installed) 
properly. This proposed requirement minimizes the burden on individual owners and operators 
and small entities, while ensuring that the engine and aftertreatment device is operated and 
maintained correctly. Further, EPA does not believe that it is reasonable to subject small 
stationary RICE and stationary emergency RICE to performance testing. Subjecting the engines 
to maintenance requirements will assist in minimizing and maintaining emissions below the 
emission standards. The cost of requiring performance testing on these engines would be too 
significant when compared to the cost of the unit itself and to the benefits of such testing. 
Subjecting stationary RICE located at area sources that are not subject to numerical emission 
standards to performance testing would not serve a meaningful purpose. 
For stationary non-emergency RICE located at major sources that are greater than or 
equal to 100 hp and stationary RICE located at area sources that are subject to numerical 
emission standards, EPA determined that performance testing is necessary to confirm that the 
emission standards are being met. Again, EPA has attempted to reduce compliance requirements 
and is proposing a level of performance testing commensurate with ensuring that the emission 
standards are being met. Therefore, for non-emergency stationary RICE located at major sources 
that are greater than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp and stationary RICE 
located at area sources that are subject to numerical emission standards, EPA chose to require an 
initial performance test only. However, if the engine is rebuilt or overhauled, the engine must be 
re-tested to demonstrate that it meets the emission standards. 
For non-emergency stationary RICE greater than 500 hp, testing every 8,760 hours of 
operation of 3 years, whichever comes first, is also required. EPA believes such a requirement is 
appropriate for these size engines, but does not believe that further testing is necessary for

 4-32 
smaller engines, i.e., those less than or equal to 500 hp. Subsequent performance testing is 
appropriate for engines greater than 500 hp due to their size and frequency of operation. Plus, 
many States mandate more stringent compliance requirements for large engines. Finally, the 
RICE NESHAP for engines greater than 500 hp located at major sources also required further 
performance testing following the initial compliance demonstration. 
Owners and operators of stationary non-emergency 2SLB, 4SLB, 4SRB, and CI RICE 
that are greater than 500 hp and are located at an area source, and stationary non-emergency CI 
RICE that are greater than 500 hp and are located at a major source must continuously monitor 
pressure drop across the catalyst and catalyst inlet temperature if the engine is equipped with 
oxidation catalyst or NSCR. These parameters serve as surrogates of the catalyst performance. 
The pressure drop across the catalyst can indicate if the catalyst is damaged or fouled, in which 
case, catalyst performance would decrease. If the pressure drop across the catalyst deviates by 
more than two inches of water from the pressure drop across the catalyst measured during the 
initial performance test, the catalyst might be damaged or fouled. If the catalyst is changed, the 
pressure drop across the catalyst must be reestablished. The catalyst inlet temperature is a 
requirement for proper performance of the catalyst. In general, the catalyst performance will 
decrease as the catalyst inlet temperature decreases. In addition, if the catalyst inlet temperature 
is too high, it might be an indication of ignition misfiring, poisoning, or fouling, which would 
decrease catalyst performance. In addition, the catalyst requires inlet temperatures to be greater 
than or equal to the specified temperature for the reduction of HAP emissions. 
4.7    How Did EPA Determine the Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements? 
EPA discussed the specific reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are being 
proposed earlier in this report. In general, EPA has attempted to reduce the reporting and 
recordkeeping burden on affected owners and operators. The following presents the rationale for 
the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  
Owners and operators of emergency engines are required to keep records of their hours of 
operation (emergency and non-emergency). Owners and operators must install a non-resettable 
hour meter on their engines to record the necessary information. The owner and operators are 
required to record the time of operation and the reason the engine was in operation during that 
time. EPA believes these requirements are appropriate for emergency engines. The requirement 
to maintain records documenting why the engine was operating will ensure that regulatory 
agencies have the necessary information to determine if the engine was in compliance with the 
maintenance and testing hour limitation of 100 hours per year.

 4-33 
EPA does not believe the recordkeeping requirements being placed upon owners and 
operators of stationary emergency engines are onerous. Emergency engines are often equipped 
with the equipment necessary to record hours of operation and operators may already be 
recording the information. Even as a brand new requirement, recording the time and reason of 
operation should take minimal time and effort. Further, recording the hours and reason for 
operation is necessary to assure that the engine is in compliance. Finally, these requirements are 
consistent with previously promulgated requirements affecting the same or similar engines, 
namely under the CI and SI NSPS. 
The reporting requirements being proposed in this rule are consistent with those required 
for engines subject to the 2004 rule, i.e., stationary RICE greater than 500 hp located at major 
sources and are based on the General Provisions. Owners and operators of existing emergency 
stationary RICE, existing stationary RICE that are less than 100 hp and existing stationary RICE 
that are not subject to any numerical emission standards, do not have to submit the notifications 
listed in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A). Owners and operators of 
all other engines must submit an initial notification, notification of performance test, and a 
notification of compliance for each stationary RICE which must comply with the specified 
emission limitations.  
4.8  How Cost Estimates Are Derived 
4.8.1  Introduction 
The cost impacts associated with the proposed rule consist of different types of costs, 
which include the annual and capital costs of controls, costs associated with keeping records of 
information necessary to demonstrate compliance, costs associated with reporting requirements 
under the General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, costs of purchasing and operating 
equipment associated with continuous parametric monitoring, and the cost of conducting 
performance testing to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards. The costs presented 
in this section are calculated based on the control cost methodology presented in the EPA (2002) 
Air Pollution Control Cost Manual prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.6F7 This 
methodology sets out a procedure by which capital and annualized costs are defined and 
estimated, and this procedure is often used to estimate the costs of rulemakings such as this one. 
The capital costs presented in this section are annualized using a 7% interest rate, a rate that is 
consistent with the guidance provided in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s)

(2003) Circular A-4.7F8 The following sections describe how the various cost elements were 
estimated.  
4.8.2  Control Costs 
For engines that will need to add control technology to meet the emission standards, the 
following equations were used to estimate capital and annual control costs: 
Cost Equations for RICE Add-on Control Technologies  
Technology Capital Cost Annual Cost 
NSCR $19.7 x hp + $1,799 $2.65 x hp + $657 
Oxidation catalyst $11.3 x hp - $170 $1.52 x hp + $393 
CDPF $7.48 x hp + $1,304 $6.27 x hp + $1,094 
 
The control costs were obtained from a memorandum of information developed for 
previous engine rulemakings and is available from Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0030. 8F9  
4.8.3   Recordkeeping 
No costs were attributed to the requirement of following the manufacturer’s emission-
related operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements or the owner or operator’s own 
maintenance plan. It is expected that the majority of owners and operators are already following 
some type of O&M requirements and minimal to no additional burden is expected. Costs 
associated with recording the hours of operation of emergency engines are based on labor rates 
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site (1Hhttp://www.bls.gov/news.release 
/ecec.toc.htm) and is $68 per hour for technical labor. The final total wage rate was based on the 
2005 compensation rates for professional staff and adjusted by an overhead and profit rate of 
167%. The year 2005 was used for consistency in order to have the same basis for all costs. All 
costs were later converted to 2007 dollars for purposes of presenting costs associated with the 
rule in present day terms. One hour per year is expected to be sufficient to records hours of 
operating for stationary emergency engines. No cost is attributed to purchasing and installing an 
hour-meter since most stationary engines already come equipped with such equipment.

4.8.4   Reporting 
Most engines affected by this rule will be subject to reporting requirements such as 
reading instructions, training personnel, submitting an initial notification, submitting a 
notification of performance test(s), and submitting a compliance report. Owners and operators of 
engines less than 100 hp, emergency engines, and engines that are not subject to any numerical 
emission standards (e.g., 2SLB less than or equal to 249 hp located at area sources) are not 
subject to any reporting requirements. The reporting requirements are based on $68 per hour for 
technical labor to comply with the reporting requirements. It is estimated that a total of 14 hours 
will be needed. 
4.8.5 Monitoring 
The cost of monitoring includes the purchase of a continuous parametric monitoring 
system (CPMS). Non-emergency engines greater than 500 hp that have add-on controls are 
required to use a CPMS to monitor the catalyst inlet temperature and pressure drop across the 
catalyst to ensure those parameters do not exceed the operating limitations. The cost of 
purchasing and operating a CPMS was obtained from vendor quotes received for previous 
rulemaking and adjusted to 2007 dollars.9F10 The capital cost of  a CPMS for a large engine facility 
is $531. It is estimated that 30 hours per year is necessary to operate and maintain the CPMS and 
that 6 hours per year (or 0.5 hours per month) is needed to record information from the CPMS. It 
is assumed that all engines subject to continuous monitoring would be located at large engine 
facilities.  
4.8.6   Performance Testing 
The cost of conducting performance testing is based on the cost of portable analyzer 
testing and is $1,000 per engine. Since in most cases only an initial performance test is required, 
it is expected that a testing firm will be conducting the performance test. The cost of testing is 
based on testing two engines where facilities have engines less than 500 hp for a reduction in 
cost of testing per engine. The testing cost is based on testing three engines where facilities have 
engines larger than 500 hp. The testing costs are based on information previously obtained from 
engine testing firms 10F11 and recently obtained information summarized in the memorandum 
“Portable Analyzer Testing Costs.”

Summary of Cost Impacts. A summary of the total capital and annualized costs 
associated with the rule and a breakdown of the costs by NAICS codes are presented in Tables 4-
4 through 4-7. Costs are presented by type of cost (i.e., control device, or administrative), 
industry, and engine size category, and they are also listed with the number of affected engines 
by size category. These cost estimates do not account for fuel price increases that may result 
from affected RICE switching to ULSD fuel as part of compliance with this proposed rule.  In 
addition, these costs are not adjusted for retirement of existing RICE that may occur between the 
current year and 2013.  All of these estimates are taken from the memo “Impacts Associated with 
NESHAP for Existing Stationary RICE” that is found in the docket for this rulemaking.  
The total national capital cost for the proposed rule is estimated to be $528 million, and 
the total national annualized cost is $345 million (2007 dollars) in 2013. The total national 
capital costs for area sources are about four times higher than those for major sources, and the 
total national annualized costs for area sources are about twice that for major sources. The 
electric power generation and natural gas transmission industries are each expected to receive 
43% of the capital costs and 44 and 33% of the annualized costs, respectively.  
Summary of Emission Reductions. The proposed rule is expected to reduce total HAP 
emissions from stationary RICE by approximately 13,000 tons per year (tpy) beginning in the 
year 2013 or the first year the rule will become effective. EPA estimates that approximately 
290,000 stationary SI engines will be subject to the rule and nearly 1 million stationary CI 
engines will be subject to the rule. These estimates include stationary engines located at major 
and area sources; however, not all stationary engines are subject to numerical emission 
standards. As with the costs, these estimates are not adjusted for retirement of existing RICE that 
may occur between the current year and 2013.  Further information regarding the estimated 
reductions of the proposed rule can be found in the memorandum entitled “Impacts Associated 
with NESHAP for Existing Stationary RICE,” which is available in the docket. 
In addition to HAP emissions reductions, the proposed rule will reduce other pollutants 
such as CO, NOx, PM, SOx, and VOC. The proposed rule is expected to reduce emissions of CO 
by more than 511,000 tpy in the year 2013. Emissions of NOx are expected to be reduced by 
79,000 tpy in the year 2013. Reductions of PM are estimated at close to 2,600 tpy in the year 
2013, and all of the PM is in the PM2.5 fraction. SOx reductions are expected to be more than 
4,600 tpy in the year 2013. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are estimated to be 
reduced by 90,000 tpy in the year 2013. Table 4-8 provides a listing of these pollutant 
reductions.

4.9 Baseline Emissions and Emission Reductions 
  Tables 4-8 through 4-10 present the baseline emissions by pollutant, engine type (CI and 
SI, non-emergency and emergency), and engine size.  Tables 4-8 and 4-9 present this 
information for the CI engines; Table 4-10 presents this information for the SI engines.  As 
shown in these tables, there are no emission reductions from emergency CI engines.  Table 4-
11 presents the emission reductions by pollutant, engine type and engine size, and Table 4-12 
presents a summary of the emission reductions across all pollutants, engine types and sizes.   
All emission estimates are for the year in which full implementation of this proposal is 
required (2013).    More information on these emissions, emission reductions, and how these 
estimates are generated can be found in the memo “Impacts Associated with NESHAP for 
Existing Stationary RICE” that is available in the public docket for this rulemaking.

SECTION 5  
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS, ENERGY IMPACTS, AND SOCIAL COSTS 
The EIA provides decision makers with social cost estimates and enhances understanding 
of how the costs may be distributed across stakeholders (EPA, 2000). Although several 
economic frameworks can be used to estimate social costs for regulations of this size and sector 
scope, OAQPS has typically used partial equilibrium market models. However, the current data 
do not provide sufficient details to develop a market model; the data that are available have little 
or no sector/firm detail and are reported at the national level. In addition, some sectors have 
unique market characteristics (e.g., hospitals) that make developing partial equilibrium models 
difficult. Given these constraints, we used the direct compliance costs as a measure of total social 
costs. In addition, we also provide a qualitative analysis of the proposed rule’s impact on 
stakeholder decisions, a qualitative discussion on if unfunded mandates occur as a result of this 
proposed rule, and the potential distribution of social costs between consumers and producers. 
5.1 Compliance Costs of the Proposed Rule 
For the year 2013, EPA’s engineering cost analysis estimates the total annualized costs of 
the proposed rule are $345 million (in 2007 dollars) as found in the memo “Impacts Associated 
with Existing Stationary NESHAP,” which can be found in the docket for this rulemaking.  
As shown in Figure 5-1, the majority of the costs fall on the electric power sector (46%), 
followed by the natural gas transmission sector (31%). The remaining industries each account for 
less than 10% of the total annualized cost.  
The proposed rule will affect approximately 1.3 million existing stationary diesel 
engines. As shown in Figure 5-2, most of the affected engines fall within the 100 to 175 hp 
category (31%). The next highest categories are 50 to 100 hp (23%) and 175 to 300 hp (21%). 
The remaining engines are concentrated in the 300 to 600 hp category (16%). 
The annualized compliance costs per engine vary by the engine size (see Figure 5-3). For 
300 hp engines or less, the annualized per-engine costs are below $200 per engine. Per-engine 
costs for higher horsepower (hp) engines range between $600 and $1,600.

Figure 5-3. Average Annualized Cost per Engine by Horsepower Group: 2013 ($2007)  
 
To assess the size of the compliance relative to the value of the goods and services for 
industries using affected engines, we collected census data for selected industries. At the industry 
level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.7%) (Table 
5-1). These industry level cost-to-sales ratios can be interpreted as an average impact on 
potentially affected firms in these industries. Based on the cost-to-sales ratios, we can conclude 
that the annualized cost of this rule should be no higher than 1% of the sales for a firm in each of 
these industries. 
5.2 How Might People and Firms Respond? A Partial Equilibrium Analysis 
Markets are composed of people as consumers and producers trying to do the best they 
can given their economic circumstances. One way economists illustrate behavioral responses to 
pollution control costs is by using market supply and demand diagrams. The market supply curve 
describes how much of a good or service firms are willing and able to sell to people at a 
particular price; we often draw this curve as upward sloping because some production resources 
are fixed. As a result, the cost of producing an additional unit typically rises as more units are 
made. The market demand curve describes how much of a good or service consumers are willing

and able to buy at some price. Holding other factors constant, the quantity demand is assumed to 
fall when prices rise. In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium price (P0) and quantity (Q0) 
is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves (see Figure 5-4). 
5.2.1 Changes in Market Prices and Quantities  
To qualitatively assess how the regulation may influence the equilibrium price and 
quantity in the affected markets, we assumed the market supply function shifts up by the 
additional cost of producing the good or service; the unit cost increase is typically calculated by 
dividing the annual compliance cost estimate by the baseline quantity (Q0) (see Figure 5-4). As 
shown, this model makes two predictions: the price of the affected goods and services are likely 
to rise and the consumption/production levels are likely to fall.

The size of these changes depends on two factors: the size of the unit cost increase 
(supply shift) and differences in how each side of the market (supply and demand) responds to 
changes in price. Economists measure responses using the concept of price elasticity, which 
represents the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. This 
dependence has been expressed in the following formula:11F1 
( )Demand) of Elasticity Price -Supply  of Elasticity Price
Supply of Elasticity Pricecost  uniter-Share of p =  
 
As a general rule, a higher share of the per-unit cost increases will be passed on to 
consumers in markets where  
 goods and services are necessities and people do not have good substitutes that they 
can switch to easily (demand is inelastic) and

 suppliers have excess capacity and can easily adjust production levels at minimal 
costs, or the time period of analysis is long enough that suppliers can change their 
fixed resources; supply is more elastic over longer periods.  
Short-run demand elasticities for energy goods (electricity and natural gas), agricultural 
products, and construction are often inelastic. Specific estimates of short-run demand elasticities 
for these products can be obtained from existing literature. For the short-run demand of energy 
products, the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) buildings module uses values between 
0.1 and 0.3; a 1% increase in price leads to a 0.1 to 0.3% decrease in energy demand (Wade, 
2003). For the short-run demand of agriculture and construction, the EPA has estimated 
elasticities to be 0.2 for agriculture and approximately 1 for construction (EPA, 2004). As a 
result, a 1% increase in the prices of agriculture products would lead to a 0.2% decrease in 
demand for those products, while a 1% increase in construction prices would lead to 
approximately a 1% decrease in demand for construction. Given these demand elasticity 
scenarios (shaded in gray), approximately a 1% increase unit costs would result in a price 
increase of 0.1 to 1% (Table 5-2). As a result, 10 to 100% of the unit cost increase could be 
passed on to consumers in the form of higher goods/services prices. This price increase would 
correspond to a 0.1 to 0.8% decline in consumption in these markets (Table 5-3).

Given that the electric power sector bears close to half of the estimated compliance costs

United States (EIA, 2000), the competitive model is not necessarily applicable for this industry.

Although the electricity industry continues to go through a process of restructuring, whereby the 
industry is moving toward a more competitive framework (see Figure 5-5 for the status of 
restructuring by state),12F2 in many states, electricity prices continue to be fully regulated by Public 
Service Commissions. As a result, the rules and processes outlined by these agencies would 
ultimately determine how these additional regulatory costs would be recovered by affected 
entities. 
5.2.3.  Partial Equilibrium Measures of Social Cost: Changes Consumer and Producer 
Surplus  
In partial equilibrium analysis, the social costs are estimated by measuring the changes in 
consumer and producer surplus, and these values can be determined using the market supply and 
demand model (Figure 5-4). The change in consumer surplus is measured as follows: 
 )CS = – [)Q1 × )p] + [0.5 × )Q × )p]. (5.1) 
Higher market prices and lower quantities lead to consumer welfare losses. Similarly, the change 
in producer surplus is measured as follows: 
 )PS = [)Q1 × )p] – [)Q1 × t] – [0.5 × )Q × ()p – t)]. (5.2) 
Higher unit costs and lower production level reduce producer surplus because the net price 
change ()p – t) is negative. However, these losses are mitigated because market prices tend to 
rise.

5.3 Social Cost Estimate 
Differences between social cost estimates derived from a perfect competition partial 
equilibrium models and engineering direct compliance cost methods may be small. As shown in 
Table 5-1 the compliance costs are only a small fraction of the affected product value; this 
suggests that, assuming a relatively inelastic change of supply in response to the compliance 
costs, the shift of the supply curve may also be small and result in small changes in market prices 
and consumption. Based on the assumption of relatively inelastic supply and the small size of 
compliance cost compared to affected product value, EPA believes the national annualized 
compliance cost estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the social cost of this proposed 
rule. 
5.4 Energy Impacts 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) provides that agencies will prepare 
and submit to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, a Statement of Energy Effects for certain actions identified as 
“significant energy actions.” Section 4(b) of Executive Order 13211 defines “significant energy

  5-9
actions” as any action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including 
notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking: 
(1) (i) that is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order, 
and (ii) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; 
or (2) that is designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
as a significant energy action. 
This rule is not a significant energy action as designated by the Administrator of the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs because it is not likely to have a significant adverse 
impact on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. EPA has prepared an analysis of energy 
impacts that explains this conclusion as follows below. 
With respect to energy supply and prices, the analysis in Table 5-1 suggests at the 
industry level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.7%). 
As a result, we can conclude supply and price impacts should be small.  
To enhance understanding regarding the regulation’s influence on energy consumption, 
we examined publicly available data describing energy consumption for the electric power sector 
that will be affected by this rule. The Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (EIA, 2008) provides energy 
consumption data. As shown in Table 5-4, this industry account for less than 0.5% of the U.S. 
total liquid fuels and less than 6.5% of natural gas. As a result, any energy consumption changes 
attributable to the regulatory program should not significantly influence the supply, distribution, 
or use of energy. 
5.5 Unfunded Mandates 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, 
requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their 
regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. This rule 
contains a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. 
Accordingly, EPA has prepared under section 202 of the UMRA a written statement which is 
summarized below in this section.

5.5.1 Statutory Authority 
As discussed previously in this RIA the statutory authority for the proposed rule is 
section 112 of the CAA. Section 112(b) lists the 189 chemicals, compounds, or groups of 
chemicals deemed by Congress to be HAP. These toxic air pollutants are to be regulated by 
NESHAP. Section 112(d) of the CAA directs us to develop NESHAP based on MACT, which 
require existing and new major sources to control emissions of HAP. These NESHAP apply to 
existing stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 HP located at major sources of HAP 
emissions, existing non-emergency stationary CI RICE greater than 300 HP, and existing 
stationary RICE located at area sources of HAP emissions, however, only certain existing 
stationary RICE have substantive regulatory requirements. EPA promulgated NESHAP for 
existing, new, and reconstructed stationary RICE greater than 500 HP located at major sources 
on June 15, 2004 (69 FR 33474). EPA promulgated NESHAP for new and reconstructed 
stationary RICE that are located at area sources of HAP emissions and for new and reconstructed 
stationary RICE that have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 HP that are located at major 
sources of HAP emissions on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 3568). EPA is required to address HAP 
emissions from stationary RICE located at area sources under section 112(k) of the CAA.

In compliance with section 205(a), we identified and considered a reasonable number of 
regulatory alternatives that are shown and discussed in Chapter 4 of this RIA. The regulatory 
alternative upon which the rule is based represents the MACT floor for stationary RICE less than 
or equal to 500 HP located at major sources and GACT for stationary RICE located at area 
sources and, as a result, it is the least costly and least burdensome alternative. 
5.5.2 Social Costs and Benefits 
The Agency’s assessment of costs and benefits is detailed in this RIA. Based on 
estimated compliance costs on all sources associated with the proposed rule and the predicted 
change in prices and production in the affected industries, the estimated social costs of the 
proposed rule are $345 million (2007 dollars). It is estimated that by 2013, HAP will be reduced 
by 13,000 tpy due to reductions in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, methanol and other 
HAP from existing stationary RICE. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have been classified as 
“probable human carcinogens.” Acrolein, methanol and the other HAP are not considered 
carcinogenic, but produce several other toxic effects. The proposed rule will also achieve 
reductions in 511,000 tons of CO, approximately 79,000 tons of NOx per year, about 90,000 tons 
of VOC per year, about 4,600 tons per year of SO2,   and approximately 2,600 tons of PM per 
year, in the year 2013. Exposure to CO can affect the cardiovascular system and the central 
nervous system. Emissions of NOx and SO2  can transform into PM, which can result in fatalities 
and many respiratory problems (such as asthma or bronchitis); and NOx can also transform into 
ozone causing several respiratory problems to affected populations.  
The total monetized benefits of the proposed rule, as will be shown in more detail in 
Chapter 7, range from $0.9 to $2.0 billion (2007 dollars). The monetized benefits are comprised 
primarily of the benefits from reductions in directly emitted PM2.5 and PM2.5 created from 
transformation of NOx and SO2. We cannot provide a monetary estimate for the benefits 
associated with reductions of HAP and CO due to a lack of scientific knowledge of the links 
between the reductions in incidence of the health and environmental effects listed and a value 
that can be placed on them. EPA currently has research going on to provide such monetized 
estimates. We are also unable to quantify and monetize all categories of benefits of NOx 
reductions (ecosystem and environmental effects), and to monetize reduction in premature 
mortalities associated with ozone reductions. The methodology for estimating monetized benefits 
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 of the RIA.

5.5.3 Future and Disproportionate Costs 
The UMRA requires that we estimate, where accurate estimation is reasonably feasible, 
future compliance costs imposed by the rule and any disproportionate budgetary effects. Our 
estimates of the future compliance costs of the proposed rule are discussed previously in Chapter 
4 of this RIA. We do not believe that there will be any disproportionate budgetary effects of the 
proposed rule on any particular areas of the country, State or local governments, types of 
communities (e.g., urban, rural), or particular industry segments.  
5.5.4 Effects on the National Economy 
 The UMRA requires that we estimate the effect of the proposed rule on the 
national economy. To the extent feasible, we must estimate the effect on productivity, economic 
growth, full employment, creation of productive jobs, and international competitiveness of the 
U.S. goods and services if we determine that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible and that 
such effect is relevant and material. The nationwide economic impact of the proposed rule is 
presented earlier in this RIA chapter. This analysis provides estimates of the effect of the 
proposed rule on most of the categories mentioned above, and these estimates are presented 
earlier in this RIA chapter. In addition, we have determined that the proposed rule contains no 
regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. 
Therefore, today’s rule is not subject to the requirements of section 203 of the UMRA.

Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit enterprises. 
After considering the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, the 
screening analysis indicates that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities (or “SISNOSE”).  
6.1   Small Entity Data Set 
The industry sectors covered by the proposed rule were identified during the development 
of the cost analysis found in the memorandum “Impacts Associated with NESHAP for Existing 
Stationary RICE.”   The SUSB provides national information on the distribution of economic 
variables by industry and enterprise size (U.S. Census, 2008a, b).13F1 The Census Bureau and the 
Office of Advocacy of the SBA supported and developed these files for use in a broad range of 
economic analyses.14F2 Statistics include the total number of establishments and receipts for all 
entities in an industry; however, many of these entities may not necessarily be covered by the 
proposed rule. SUSB also provides statistics by enterprise employment and receipt size.  
The Census Bureau’s definitions used in the SUSB are as follows: 
 Establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 
conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.  
 Receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes.  
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
                                                 
1The SUSB data do not provide establishment information for the national security NAICS code (92811) or irrigated 
farms. Since most national security installations are owned by the federal government (e.g., military bases), EPA 
assumes these entities would not be considered small. For irrigated farms, we relied on receipt data provided in 
the 2003 Farm and Irrigation Survey (USDA, 2004).

enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008) apply to an establishment’s 
“ultimate parent company,” we assumed in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is 
consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for SBREFA 
screening analyses and the terms are used interchangeably.  
6.1 Small Entity Economic Impact Measures 
The analysis generated a set of establishment sales tests (represented as cost-to-receipt 
ratios)15F3 for NAICS codes associated with sectors listed in Table 6-1. Although the appropriate 
SBA size definition should be applied at the parent company (enterprise) level, we can only 
compute and compare ratios for a model establishment owned by an enterprise within an SUSB 
size range (employment or receipts). Using the SUSB size range helps us account for receipt 
differences between establishments owned by large and small enterprises and also allows us to 
consider the variation in small business definitions across affected industries. Using 
establishment receipts is also a conservative approach, because an establishment’s parent 
company (the “enterprise”) may have other economic resources that could be used to cover the 
costs of the proposed rule. 
6.1.1 Model Establishment Receipts and Annual Compliance Costs 
The sales test compares a representative establishment’s total annual engine costs to the 
average establishment receipts for enterprises in several size categories.16F4 For industries with SBA 
employment size standards, we calculated average establishment receipts for each enterprise 
employment range (Table 6-2). For industries with SBA receipt size standards, we  
                                                 
3The following metrics for other small entity economic impact measures (if applicable) would potentially include 
• small governments (if applicable): “revenue” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
government revenues and 
• small nonprofits (if applicable): “expenditure” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
operating expenses, 
4For the 1 to 20 employee category, we excluded SUSB data for enterprises with zero employees. These enterprises 
did not operate the entire year.

Annual entity compliance costs vary depending on the size of the diesel engines used at 
the affected establishment. Absent facility-specific information, we computed per-entity 
compliance costs based for three different cases based on representative establishments—Cases 
1, 2, and 3 (see Table 6-4). Each representative establishment differs based on the size and 
number of diesel engines being used. Compliance costs are calculated by summing the total 
annualized compliance costs for the relevant engine categories, dividing the sum by the total 
existing population of those engines, and multiplying the average engine cost by the number of 
engines assumed to be at the establishment. Since NAICS 2211, 48621, and 622110 are 
fundamentally different than other industries considered in this analysis, we used different 
assumptions about what constitutes the representative establishment and report these 
assumptions separately.  
 Case 1: The representative establishment for all industries uses three 750+ hp engines 
with an average compliance cost of $1,603 per engine, resulting in a total annualized 
compliance cost of approximately $4,810 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 2: The representative establishment in NACIS 2211, 48621, and 622110 uses 
two 50 to 750+ hp engines with an average compliance cost of $352 per engine, 
resulting in a total annualized compliance cost of $704 for this representative 
establishment. For all other industries, the representative establishment uses two 50 to 
300 hp engines with an average compliance cost of $141 per engine, resulting in a 
total compliance cost of $281 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 3: The representative establishment for all industries uses two 50 to 100 hp 
engines with an average compliance cost of $58 per engine, resulting in a total 
compliance cost of $115 for this representative establishment.  
EPA believes that small entities are most likely to face costs similar to Case 2 (columns 
shaded in gray in Table 6-4) because most of the engines to be affected by this proposal in 
NAICS 111, 112, 238, 211111, and 211112 are under 300 hp capacity, and most small entities in 
these industries will own engines of this size or smaller. However, it is difficult to make a similar 
claim for NAICS 2211, 48621, and 622110 based on the existing distribution of engines in these 
industries.  
For the sales test, we divided the representative establishment compliance costs reported 
in Table 6-4 by the representative establishment receipts reported in Tables 6-2 and 6-3. This is 
known as the cost-to-receipt (i.e., sales) ratio, or the “sales test.” The “sales test” is the impact 
methodology EPA employs in analyzing small entity impacts as opposed to a “profits test,” in 
which annualized compliance costs are calculated as a share of profits.

aCase 2 is the one used to determine the small entity impacts (and to provide the SISNOSE determination) for this 
proposed rule.  
This is because revenues or sales data are commonly available data for entities normally 
impacted by EPA regulations and profits data normally made available are often not the true 
profit earned by firms because of accounting and tax considerations. Revenues as typically 
published are usually correct figures and are more reliably reported when compared to profit 
data. The use of a “sales test” for estimating small business impacts for a rulemaking such as this 
one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on compliance with SBREFA17F5 and is consistent 
with guidance published by the U.S. SBA’s Office of Advocacy that suggests that cost as a 
percentage of total revenues is a metric for evaluating cost increases on small entities in relation 
to increases on large entities.18F6  
If the cost-to-receipt ratio is less than 1%, then we consider the proposed rule to not have 
a significant impact on the establishment company in question. We summarize the industries 
with cost-to-receipt ratios exceeding 1% below:

 Case 3: No industries 
Sensitivity Analysis (unlikely): 
 Case 1: NAICS 211112 with less than 20 employees, NAICS 2211, 48621, and 238 
with receipts less than $500,000 per year, and irrigated farms with receipts of 
$100,000 or less per year 
In the Case 2 primary analysis, only establishments in NAICS 2211 with receipts less 
than $100,000 per year have cost-to-receipt ratios above 1%. However, establishments earning 
this level of receipts are likely to be using smaller engines than those assumed in Case 2, such as 
50 to 100 hp engines. The results of our Case 3 analysis demonstrate that these establishments 
are not significantly impacted when taking this engine size into account.  
6.2 Small Government Entities 
The rule also covers sectors that include entities owned by small and large governments. 
However, given the uncertainty and data limitations associated with identifying and 
appropriately classifying these entities, we computed a “revenue” test for a model small 
government, where the annualized compliance cost is a percentage of annual government 
revenues (U.S. Census, 2005a, b). The use of a “revenue test” for estimating impacts to small 
governments for a rulemaking such as this one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on 
compliance with SBREFA,19F7 and is consistent with guidance published by the US SBA’s Office 
of Advocacy.20F8 For example, from the 2002 Census (in 2007 dollars), the average revenue for 
small governments (counties and municipalities) with populations fewer than 10,000 are $3 
million per entity, and the average revenue for local governments with populations fewer than 
50,000 is $7 million per entity. For the smallest group of local governments (<10,000 people), 
the cost-to-revenue ratio would be 0.2% or less under each case. For the larger group of 
governments (<50,000 people), the cost-to-revenue ratio is 0.1% or less under all cases.

SECTION 7  
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
7.1 Calculation of Human Health Benefits 
To estimate the PM2.5-related human health benefits of reducing emissions from the 
proposed NESHAP for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE), EPA used the 
benefits transfer approach it created for the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) accompanying the 
recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone.21F1, 22F2 In that RIA, EPA 
developed and applied PM2.5 benefit-per-ton coefficients to estimate the PM2.5 co-benefits 
resulting from reductions in emissions of NOX. EPA has followed that same approach to estimate 
the health benefits for the projected emission reductions of PM2.5 precursor pollutants associated 
with this proposal. 
EPA did not perform an air quality modeling assessment of the emission reductions 
resulting from installing controls on these RICE because of the time and resource constraints and 
the limited value of such an analysis for the purposes of developing the regulatory approach for 
this proposal. This lack of air quality modeling limited EPA’s ability to perform a 
comprehensive benefits analysis for this proposal because our benefits model BenMAP requires 
either air quality modeling or monitoring data. In the absence of formal air quality modeling, we 
applied PM2.5 benefit-per-ton (BPT) coefficients to estimate benefits. In addition to the 2008 
Ozone NAAQS RIA, this benefit-per-ton approach has been used in RIAs prepared for a number 
of previous EPA rulemakings, e.g. the 2002 large industrial spark ignition engine and 
recreational vehicles rule, the 2004 Industrial Boilers and Process Heaters MACT, and the 2008 
Petroleum Refineries NSPS. 
The PM2.5 precursor pollutant benefit per-ton estimates provide the total monetized 
human health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and morbidity related benefits) of 
reducing one ton of PM2.5 or PM2.5 precursor emissions from a specified source. We include

direct PM2.5 as PM2.5 precursor emissions (SOX, NOX, and VOCs).23F3  These PM benefits are 
actually co-benefits, which result from the installing controls to limit hazardous air pollutants 
(HAPs).  Unfortunately, we are unable to quantify the human health benefits of reducing the 
13,000 tons of HAPs, 510,000 tons of carbon monoxide (CO), or ozone precursor pollutants in 
this analysis because benefit-per-ton estimates are not available for these pollutants. The PM co-
benefits estimates in this proposal analysis utilize the concentration-response functions as 
described in the PM NAAQS RIA analysis.24F4   Specifically, we present two estimates reported in 
the epidemiology literature, as well as a set of 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation 
study.  Each data source is described below: 
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the study of the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort reported in Pope et al. 
(2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary benefits 
estimate.  
 One estimate is based on Laden et al.’s (2006) reporting of the extended Six Cities 
cohort study; this study is a more recent PM epidemiological study that was used as 
an alternative in the PM NAAQS RIA.  
 The source for the other twelve estimates are based on the results of EPA's expert 
elicitation study25F5, 26F6 on the PM-mortality relationship and interpreted for benefits 
analysis in EPA's final RIA for the PM NAAQS, published in September 2006 (U.S. 
EPA, 2006). For that study, twelve experts (labeled A through L) provided 
independent estimates of the PM-mortality concentration-response function. EPA 
practice has been to develop independent estimates of PM-mortality estimates 
corresponding to the concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve 
experts, to better characterize the degree of variability in the expert responses. 
                                                 
3 In this analysis, the monetized benefits of reducing VOCs only reflect their effects as a PM2.5 precursor pollutant, 
not as a precursor to ozone. The benefit-per-ton estimate for VOCs includes more uncertainty than the other 
PM2.5 precursor pollutants because the underlying photochemical modeling systematically underpredicts the 
secondary formation of organic carbon due to uncertainties in science of secondary organic carbon formation. 
EPA's modeling system has been peer reviewed, represents the state of science, and uses the best available and 
most comprehensive data sets to characterize meteorology and emissions. Because the relative effectiveness of 
VOC controls are underestimated in the modeling, the benefits of reducing VOCs as a PM2.5 precursor may also 
be underestimated.

EPA considers the benefit-per-ton estimates derived from the expert elicitation to be 
indicative of the range of uncertainty associated with the health functions, whereas the range of 
benefits represented by benefit-per-ton estimates generated using the Pope et al. and Laden et al. 
functions represent the best epidemiology based estimates of PM co-benefits.  
To develop the estimate of benefits of reducing emissions from the proposal, we 
calculated the monetized benefits-per-ton of emission reductions estimates for direct PM2.5 and 
each PM2.5 precursor pollutant.  Readers interested in the complete methodology for creating the 
benefit-per-ton estimates used in this analysis may consult the Technical Support Document 
(TSD) accompanying the final Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008). In the TSD, we describe 
in detail how we generated the benefit-per-ton estimates. In summary, we used a model to 
convert emissions of direct PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (i.e., SO2, NOX, and VOCs) into changes 
in PM2.5 air quality. Next, we used the benefits model (BenMAP) to estimate the changes in 
human health based on the change in PM2.5 air quality. Finally, the monetized health benefits 
were divided by the emission reductions to create the benefit-per-ton estimates. Even though all 
fine particles are assumed to have equivalent health effects, the benefit-per-ton estimates vary 
between precursors because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form 
PM2.5. For example, NOX has a lower benefit-per-ton estimate than direct PM2.5 because it does 
not form as much PM2.5, thus the exposure would be lower, and the monetized health benefits 
would be lower. For this analysis, we assumed that 40% of the emission reductions were from 
non-EGU point sources and 60% were from area sources for PM and SOX, which are the only 
pollutants for which we have separate benefit-per-ton estimates for non-EGU sources and area 
sources.27F7  After generating the benefit-per-ton estimate, we then multiply this estimate by the 
number of tons of each pollutant reduced to derive an overall monetary value of benefits.  
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits 
modeling assumptions. Use of these $/ton values to estimate benefits associated with different 
emission control programs (e.g., for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) 
may lead to higher or lower benefit estimates than if benefits were calculated based on direct air 
quality modeling. Great care should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions 
occurring in any specific location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission 
reduction programs and therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United

States. The benefits- per-ton for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different 
from the national average. 
7.2 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Benefits Estimates 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 
are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs, it may be possible to provide a statistical 
representation of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the 
necessary information is not available. 
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5), there is a variety 
of uncertainties associated with these PM benefits. Therefore, the estimates of annual benefits 
should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of benefits expected, rather than the actual 
benefits that would occur every year. 
Below we present the estimates of the total benefits, based on our interpretation of the 
best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-HES and the NAS 
(NRC, 2002). The benefits estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. 
For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for premature mortality, which 
typically account for at least 90% of the total PM benefits, we were able to identify the following 
uncertainties: 
1. Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature death at 
concentrations near those experienced by most Americans on a daily basis. Although 
biological mechanisms for this effect have not been established definitively yet, the 
weight of the available epidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality.  
2. All fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in 
causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, because PM produced 
via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ significantly from direct 
PM released from diesel engines and other industrial sources, but no clear scientific 
grounds exist for supporting differential effects estimates by particle type.

 7-5 
 
3. The impact function for fine particles is approximately linear within the range of 
ambient concentrations under consideration. Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard.  
4. The forecasts for future emissions and associated air quality modeling are valid. 
Although recognizing the difficulties, assumptions, and inherent uncertainties in the 
overall enterprise, these analyses are based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and 
up-to-date assessment tools, and we believe the results are highly useful in assessing 
this proposal.  
5. Benefits estimated here reflect the application of a national dollar benefit-per-ton 
estimate of the benefits of reducing directly emitted fine particulates from point 
sources. Because they are based on national-level analysis, the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used here do not reflect local variability in population density, meteorology, 
exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an 
over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted 
fine particulates.  
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the 
benefits model (BenMAP). Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and 
associated estimates of uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the 
significant differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. 
However, the results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in 
Chapter 5 of the PM RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the benefits 
results presented in this analysis. In this analysis, we provide benefits estimates using 
concentration-response functions based on two epidemiology studies as well as twelve benefits 
estimates based on the concentration-response functions from the expert elicitation.  While this 
captures only a fraction of the overall uncertainty, the magnitude of the mortality C-R function is 
a critical parameter in the analysis and the uncertainty in that parameter is likely to contribute a 
large fraction of the overall uncertainty in the benefits estimates. 
7.3 Updating the Benefits Data Underlying the Benefit-per-Ton Estimates 
As described above, the estimates provided are derived through a benefits transfer 
technique that adapts monetized benefits from reductions in PM2.5 precursor pollutants that were 
estimated for the Ozone RIA utilizing nationally distributed emissions reductions. The benefit-
per-ton estimates for this analysis have been updated since the Ozone RIA was completed. They 
Deleted: OMB Review Draft – 
February 23, 2009
 7-6 
have been updated to reflect a new population dataset, a more recent currency year.28F8 EPA is 
currently in the process of generating localized benefit-per-ton estimates to better account for the 
spatial heterogeneity of benefits for a small number of urban areas. EPA believes that these 
estimates may better represent the localized benefits than estimates that use national averages. 
However, because the engines affected by this rule should be widely distributed nationally, we 
believe that the national estimates are most appropriate for this analysis. 
In addition to generating local benefit-per-ton estimates, EPA is also exploring other 
updates to the national benefit-per-ton estimates.  Technical updates would incorporate a new 
population dataset and expand the geographic scope of the national estimates.  EPA is also 
exploring changing the assumption regarding thresholds in the health impact function.  In 
previous RIAs, EPA has included sensitivity analyses for premature mortality, with alternative 
cutpoints at 0 µg/m3, 7.5 µg/m3, 12 µg/m3, and 14 µg/m3.  As a sensitivity analysis for this 
analysis, EPA explored the implication of replacing the threshold assumption with log-linear no-
threshold models similar to the authors of those original studies. 29F9  The health impact functions 
applied for our premature mortality benefits estimates are based on an assumed cutpoint at 10 
µg/m3 in the long-term mortality concentration-response function and short-term morbidity 
concentration-response functions.  We estimate that incorporating this suite of updates for this 
proposed rule would increase the benefits presented in Table 7.1 by 30% to 50%.  Because this 
analysis uses benefit-per-ton estimates, we are unable to do a sensitivity analysis using the other 
alternative cutpoints analyzed previously.   
EPA is considering this policy change in light of the results of the expert elicitation on 
PM mortality (Roman et al, 2008).  Specifically, of the 12 experts included in the expert 
elicitation, only one expert elected to specify a threshold, as the rest cited a lack of empirical 
and/or theoretical basis for a population threshold.  Furthermore, that one expert only specified a 
50% probability of a threshold (most likely at or below 5 µg/m3), which is below the cut-point 
that EPA has historically assumed.   
                                                 
8 Previous RIAs reported the benefit-per-ton estimates using 2006$. However, to be consistent with the cost 
estimates, we also updated the benefits estimates in this analysis to 2007$. Updating the currency year does not 
affect the comparison of costs and benefits because each is adjusted consistently.

7.5 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
In the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates the range33F13 of annualized 
benefits of this proposal to be $930 million to $2.0 billion ($2007) at a 3% discount rate34F14 and 
$850 million to $1.8 billion ($2007) at a 7% discount rate with annualized costs of $345 million 
($2007) at a 7% interest rate as mentioned in Chapter 4 of this RIA. Thus, the net benefits of the 
                                                 
13 This range represents benefits estimates derived from the Pope et al. study to the Laden et al. study, not the entire 
range of the expert elicitation. This range captures most of the expert opinion, while preserving the empirical 
basis of our estimates. Uncertainty goes beyond the range shown here.  
14 The benefits are discounted to account for the cessation lag in PM2.5 benefits from premature mortality and acute 
myocardial infarctions (AMIs), rather than a discounted stream of future benefits; whereas discounting the costs 
reflects the lifetime costs of the equipment. For this reason, it is appropriate in this context to use two different 
discount rates for the benefits and costs.

RICE NESHAP are $590 million to $1.6 billion at a 3% discount rate and $500 million to $1.5

benefits in 2013 minus annualized costs) utilizing all 14 different PM2.5 mortality functions. EPA 
believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the costs by a substantial margin under this 
proposal even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.
