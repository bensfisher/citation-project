3487 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
For State Regulatory Agencies 
108. What current laws or regulations 
does your State have regarding the 
disposal of dispensed controlled 
substances and noncontrolled 
substances by ultimate users? 
109. What laws or regulations, if any, 
is your State considering regarding the 
disposal of dispensed controlled or 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users? 
110. Does your State agency 
participate in any initiatives (e.g., take- 
back or mail-back programs) regarding 
the disposal of dispensed controlled and 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users at this time? If so, please describe. 
111. Is your State agency aware of any 
cases of diversion regarding take-back 
programs? If so, did the diversion result 
in the arrest or prosecution of any 
individuals? 
112. If your State agency does not 
participate in any initiatives regarding 
the disposal of dispensed controlled or 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users, why not? 
113. If your State agency participates 
in any initiatives regarding the disposal 
of dispensed controlled and

users, what would you estimate to be 
the percentage, quantity, or other 
measurable unit of controlled 
substances as compared to 
noncontrolled substances received? 
114. If your State agency participates 
in any initiatives regarding the disposal 
of dispensed controlled and 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users, does your agency fund all or part 
of the initiative? If other funding is 
received, who provides the other 
funding? 
115. If your State agency participates 
in any initiatives regarding the disposal 
of dispensed controlled and 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users, what successes have you seen 
regarding these initiatives? 
116. If your State agency participates 
in any initiatives regarding the disposal 
of dispensed controlled and 
noncontrolled substances by ultimate 
users, what challenges or difficulties 
have you encountered? 
For All Interested Parties 
117. DEA also seeks comment from all 
interested parties regarding the funding 
of the disposal of unwanted or outdated 
controlled substances held by DEA 
nonregistrants. 
Regulatory Certifications 
This action is an Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). 
Accordingly, the requirement of 
Executive Order 12866 to assess the 
costs and benefits of this action does not 
apply. Rather, among the purposes DEA 
has in publishing this ANPRM is to seek 
information from the public on the 
costs, benefits, and other impacts 
pertaining to the disposal of controlled 
substances dispensed to ultimate users 
and long term care facilities. Similarly, 
the requirements of section 603 of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply 
to this action since, at this stage, it is an 
ANPRM and not a ‘‘rule’’ as defined in 
section 601 of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. Following review of the comments 
received to this ANPRM, if DEA 
promulgates a Notice or Notices of 
Proposed Rulemaking regarding this 
issue, DEA will conduct all analyses 
required by the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, Executive Order 12866, and any 
other statutes or Executive Orders 
relevant to those rules and in effect at 
the time of promulgation.

SUMMARY: Recent changes to the 
Transportation Infrastructure Finance 
and Innovation Act (TIFIA) statute 
require changes in the TIFIA rule. In 
addition, the DOT has gained 
substantial administrative experience 
since the TIFIA rule was last amended 
in 2000. The DOT proposes to amend 
the TIFIA rule to implement the recent 
statutory changes and to incorporate 
certain other changes to the rule that it 
considers will improve the efficiency of 
the program and its usefulness to 
borrowers. In addition, the DOT seeks 
comment on policy issues with 
potentially significant impact on the 
TIFIA project selection process.

Background 
TIFIA was enacted in 1998 as part of 
the Transportation Equity Act for the 
21st Century (TEA–21) (Pub. L. 105– 
178, June 1998). TIFIA established a 
new Federal credit program under 
which the DOT may provide credit 
assistance to surface transportation 
investments of regional or national 
significance. To be selected for TIFIA 
assistance, projects must meet a number 
of statutorily specified criteria. As 
funding for this program is limited, 
projects obtaining assistance under the 
TIFIA program may be selected on a 
competitive basis. In 1999, the DOT 
promulgated a rule implementing TIFIA 
(64 FR 29742, June 2, 1999), and in 2000 
amended the rule (65 FR 44936, July 19, 
2000). In 2005, Congress enacted the 
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for 
Users (SAFETEA–LU) (Pub. L. 109–59, 
Aug. 10, 2005), which made a number 
of amendments to TIFIA. The DOT 
proposes to amend the TIFIA rule to 
implement the changes required by the 
SAFETEA–LU amendments and to 
incorporate a number of programmatic 
features that the DOT considers, based 
on its experience gained administering 
the program since the rule was last 
amended, would improve TIFIA. 
In enacting the original TIFIA 
legislation, Congress found that ‘‘a well- 
developed system of transportation 
infrastructure is critical’’ to the nation’s 
economy, and it sought to ‘‘attract new 
investment capital’’ to transportation 
infrastructure projects. Congress further 
found that TIFIA could fill ‘‘market 
gaps,’’ thereby leveraging additional 
capital from the private markets: ‘‘a 
Federal credit program for projects of 
national significance can complement 
existing funding resources by filling 
market gaps, thereby leveraging 
substantial private co-investment.’’ 
Based on this initial guidance from 
Congress, the DOT has viewed TIFIA as 
a means for the Federal Government to 
attract more private investment capital, 
to accelerate investment, to encourage a 
greater cost-beneficial approach to 
transportation infrastructure 
investments, and to more efficiently 
utilize infrastructure once constructed. 
This NPRM proposes to amend and 
partially restate the existing rule; it 
includes both proposed substantive 
changes and proposed changes of an 
editorial, clarifying, or organizational 
nature. Proposed substantive changes 
include both those mandated by 
SAFETEA–LU and those determined by 
the DOT, based upon several years of 
administrative experience with the 
TIFIA program, to improve the program. 
The DOT seeks comments particularly 
on proposed changes in the latter 
category. 
The proposed rule would amend the 
current TIFIA rule to incorporate 
changes made by SAFETEA–LU to the 
TIFIA statute. Major changes of this 
nature include a reduction in the 
minimum project size eligible for TIFIA 
assistance and a broadening of the 
categories of projects eligible to permit 
TIFIA assistance for private rail 
facilities providing public benefit to 
highway users, and surface 
transportation infrastructure 
modifications necessary to facilitate 
direct intermodal transfer and access 
into and out of a port terminal. Further 
changes to conform the rule to the 
statute would limit the amount of TIFIA 
assistance in certain instances to the 
amount of the senior project obligations, 
conform the interest rate setting 
mechanism for the line of credit to that 
for secured loans, and eliminate the 
annual 20 percent cap on line of credit 
draws. 
In the nature of non-statutory 
administrative improvements, we 
propose changing the way the DOT will 
use the term sheet in TIFIA transactions 
and in how we will apply the TIFIA 
statute’s eight selection criteria. For 
example, with regard to the selection 
criteria, the DOT proposes to change 
‘‘creditworthiness’’ to pass/fail and then 
reallocate weights for the other seven 
statutory criteria. 
In addition, we propose to reorganize 
the existing rule to make it more 
understandable to users. The 
reorganized rule would generally follow 
the steps a potential TIFIA user might 
follow in evaluating the program and 
applying for assistance. 
While the request for comments 
applies to the entire NPRM, the DOT 
seeks specific feedback on several key 
issues noted below. 
In order to accommodate emerging 
financing scenarios using TIFIA’s 
refinancing authority, DOT is seeking 
comments on the proposed definitions 
of ‘‘refinance,’’ the ‘‘maturity date’’ 
(both defined in section 80.3) associated 
with a refinancing, and DOT’s proposed 
refinancing procedures (section 80.23), 
which would require the participation 
of a guaranteed lender receiving a TIFIA 
loan guarantee. 
To facilitate the financing of projects 
that may result in significant lease 
payments or concession fees to a public 
entity, the proposed rule would clarify 
that such payments can be considered 
eligible project costs for the purpose of 
establishing the maximum amount of 
TIFIA credit assistance. Several 
provisons would apply: (1) Such 
payments must represent a fair market 
value of the asset acquired, (2) the 
proceeds of such payments must be 
dedicated to transportation projects 
eligible under title 23 or chapter 53 of 
title 49, United States Code, and (3) 
such payments must be part of a project 
in which new capital costs constitute a 
significant portion of project costs. In 
other words, the concession fee cannot 
comprise the only eligible project cost, 
as in a transaction seeking only to 
monetize an existing asset. To 
implement this policy, the DOT 
proposes to limit its consideration of 
such payments to no more than 25 
percent of total eligible project costs. 
To improve its internal credit analysis 
and capital allocation process, the 
proposed rule would require (see 
section 80.11) each applicant and 
borrower to provide a preliminary rating 
opinion letter and final investment- 
grade rating from at least two rating 
agencies. 
Finally, the DOT seeks comment on 
two additional policy issues with 
potentially significant impact on the 
TIFIA project selection process. These 
two issues are described immediately 
below. 
Use of Benefit-Cost Analysis in 
Selecting Projects for TIFIA Assistance 
In the years since TIFIA was enacted, 
borrowers have made use of the 
legislation’s inherent flexibility to 
accelerate creditworthy, public-private 
projects of regional or national 
significance. The DOT believes that 
TIFIA should be targeted to projects 
where the present value of benefits to 
the public that result from project 
completion exceed the costs of 
delivering the project, and that TIFIA be

targeted to advance user-financed 
projects instead of projects that rely 
solely or predominantly on grant 
assistance. Supporting large-scale 
projects that eliminate or reduce 
reliance on Federal grant assistance 
allows the States to target grant 
assistance on projects that cannot 
otherwise be financed. 
The National Surface Transportation 
Policy and Revenue Study Commission 
(Transportation for Tomorrow, 2008), 
the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO–04–744, 2004; GAO–05–172, 
2005; GAO–08–744T, 2008), the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (Refocus. 
Reform. Renew. A New Transportation 
Approach in America, 2008), the 
Brookings Institution (A Bridge to 
Somewhere, 2008) and other 
organizations have recommended 
greater use of benefit-cost analysis 
(BCA) to maximize the rate of return on 
Federal funds invested in transportation 
projects. These recommendations are 
primarily directed at State and 
municipal project selection, where 
application of BCA is currently limited. 
The Federal Transit Administration and 
the Federal Aviation Administration 
already require the use of BCA or 
similar economic analysis for projects 
with large capital costs that are subject 
to Federal funding discretion. 
Benefit-cost analysis is conducted by 
assigning monetary values to benefits 
(e.g., travel time saving) and costs, 
discounting future benefits and costs 
using an appropriate discount rate, and 
then comparing the sum total of 
discounted benefits to the sum total of 
discounted costs. Discounting benefits 
and costs transforms gains and losses 
occurring in different time periods to a 
common unit of measurement in the 
form of present day dollars. The 
organizations cited above recognize that 
BCA is a useful tool to help decision- 
makers identify projects with the 
greatest net benefits relative to invested 
public resources. In particular, the 
systematic process of BCA helps 
decision-makers organize information 
about, and determine trade-offs 
between, alternative transportation 
investments. 
The DOT has responsibility under 
Executive Order 12893, Principles for 
Federal Infrastructure Investments, 59 
FR 4233, to evaluate its programs using 
BCA. This requirement has not been 
construed to apply to individual 
investments made by States of formula 
funds, but is deemed to apply to overall 
programs and to discretionary Federal 
commitments of budget authority to 
individual projects. The DOT is 
considering a requirement that TIFIA 
applicants conduct BCA on their 
projects. These analyses would inform 
Federal decisions to provide TIFIA 
support to individual projects and 
would also enable the DOT to establish 
the cost-beneficial status of the overall 
TIFIA program, thereby providing a 
basis for future funding requests. The 
application of BCA to support TIFIA 
decisions would be subject to guidance 
in the Office of Management and 
Budget’s Circular A–94, Revised, 
SUBJECT: Guidelines and Discount 
Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of 
Federal Programs 1, and would follow 
other guidelines incorporated into the 
TIFIA application process. 
Æ The DOT therefore requests 
comment on the following options for 
applying BCA to TIFIA applications: 
Æ Require BCA as a threshold 
condition for TIFIA consideration. 
Under this option, projects must have 
public benefits that exceed their costs 
by a sufficient threshold level. The DOT 
seeks comment on the application of a 
threshold in general as well as the 
appropriate minimum sufficient ratio of 
benefits divided by costs that projects 
should be expected to demonstrate; or 
Æ Use BCA results to help prioritize 
projects for TIFIA selection by 
translating the existing TIFIA selection 
criteria into monetary values for 
purposes of project comparison, while 
eliminating criteria weights. For 
instance, BCA results could be used to 
assess the costs and benefits related to 
the project’s ‘‘regional or national 
significance’’, proposed in this rule as 
the highest weighted criteria. Comments 
are also requested on how this approach 
might best be applied to other criteria 
that do not readily lend themselves to 
such monetization. 
Interest Rate Policy 
OMB Circular A–129, Policies for 
Federal Credit Programs and Non-tax 
Receivables 2, states that Federal 
agencies with credit programs should 
establish interest and fee structures for 
direct loans and loan guarantees and 
should review these structures at least 
annually. In administering the TIFIA 
program, the DOT has set the rate, in all 
transactions to date, regardless of the 
perceived credit quality of the loan, at 
the minimum level allowed by the 
TIFIA statute: The rate on United States 
Treasury securities of a similar maturity 
as the loan. 
OMB Circular A–129 states that 
interest and fees should be set at levels 
that minimize default and other subsidy 
costs of the direct loan or loan 
guarantee, while supporting 
achievement of the program’s policy 
objectives. The OMB guidance goes on 
to state that, unless inconsistent with 
program purposes, riskier borrowers 
should be charged more than those who 
pose less risk. 
The DOT seeks comment regarding 
the use of its authority to offer different 
rates to different borrowers. For 
instance, the DOT could use the 
selection criteria, including benefit cost 
analysis, to weight applications by the 
social return to the public, consistent 
with Federal credit policies and TIFIA 
programmatic goals. Those projects with 
higher scores would receive the lower 
interest rates. Credit risk should also be 
factored into final interest rate 
determinations. Alternatively, some 
form of competitive loan pricing such as 
a reverse auction could be used to 
allocate TIFIA’s subsidized credit 
assistance in a manner that maximizes 
social returns while protecting the 
government’s interests. 
Section-by-Section Discussion of the 
Proposed Changes 
Section 80.1 Purpose 
The purpose of the proposed rule is 
to implement the TIFIA statute. Readers 
should refer to the statute as well as the 
rule for a complete understanding of the 
TIFIA program. 
Section 80.3 Definitions 
Definitions in the proposed rule 
generally follow the statutory 
definitions. Two exceptions are the 
proposed definitions for ‘‘guaranteed 
lender,’’ which would replace the 
statutory ‘‘lender,’’ and ‘‘borrower,’’ 
which would replace the statutory 
‘‘obligor’’; the DOT believes both of 
these proposed changes would enhance 
the rule’s clarity and more closely 
conform the regulatory language to 
industry convention. 
Other proposed changes to the 
definitions in the current rule and 
matters on which the DOT seeks 
comment include: 
‘‘Borrower’’: For the definition of the 
newly defined term ‘‘borrower,’’ we 
propose to use the current rule’s 
definition of ‘‘obligor,’’ which definition 
closely follows the language in the 
TIFIA statute’s definition of ‘‘obligor.’’ 
Additionally, we clarify that only non- 
Federal entities are eligible borrowers. 
‘‘Conditional term sheet’’: We propose 
to eliminate this definition in light of 
our proposed change in the use of the 
defined term ‘‘term sheet,’’ which 
proposed change is discussed in detail 
below in this section under the heading 
‘‘Term sheet.’’

3490 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
3 Public Law 109–291 (Sept. 29, 2006). 
4 The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 
mandated that firms desiring to be NRSROs register 
with the SEC and become subject to certain record- 
keeping and financial reporting requirements. The 
SEC’s Final Rule implementing the Credit Agency 
Reform Act of 2006 is found at 72 FR 33564 (June 
8, 2007). See 17 CFR 240.17g–1 through 240.17g– 
6. 
5 House of Representatives Report 109–203 
(2005), p. 874. 
‘‘Current credit evaluation’’: We 
propose to add a definition of current 
credit evaluation and provide 
clarification related to project 
monitoring requirements. 
‘‘Eligible project costs’’: We propose 
to add to the definition of ‘‘eligible 
project costs’’ explicit language 
implementing current Federal law 
excluding from eligibility certain project 
costs incurred prior to environmental 
clearance. (See 23 CFR 771.113). The 
proposed definition clarifies the 
eligibility of costs during construction 
associated with the operations of a 
special purpose entity formed solely to 
construct and operate the facility, in an 
amount not to exceed 5 percent of total 
eligible project costs (see 80.25, 
Limitations of Federal credit assistance). 
The proposed definition clarifies the 
eligibility of concession payments made 
to a government agency by a non- 
governmental concessionaire for the 
lease acquisition and right to operate a 
transportation facility, provided that the 
concessionaire and the State ensure that 
payments associated with lease 
acquisition represent fair market value 
and are dedicated to transportation 
projects eligible under title 23 or 
chapter 53 of title 49, United States 
Code (see 80.25, Limitations on Federal 
credit assistance). In addition, lease 
acquisition payments must be part of a 
project in which new capital costs 
constitute a significant portion of 
project costs. In other words, the 
concession payment, in and of itself, 
does not comprise an eligible project 
cost. In order to implement this policy, 
the DOT proposes to limit such 
payments to 25 percent of total eligible 
project costs and seeks public comment 
on this proposal. Further, the definition 
is expanded to include specifically the 
costs associated with refinancing long- 
term project obligations under 23 U.S.C. 
603(a)(1)(C). In the case of a refinancing, 
eligible project costs must be consistent 
with eligible project costs for any TIFIA 
project. In the case of a refinancing, 
existing debt would be considered an 
eligible project cost. Eligible project 
costs must also be consistent with the 
Federal cost principles applicable to the 
borrower: 2 CFR Part 225 (OMB Circular 
A–87 (State and local governments)), 2 
CFR Part 230 (OMB Circular A–122 
(non-profit organizations)), or 48 CFR 
Part 31 (commercial organizations). 
Lobbying costs would continue to be 
excluded under existing law. (See 31 
U.S.C. 1352, 2 CFR Part 225, App. B, 2 
CFR Part 230, App. B, 48 CFR 31.205– 
22, and 49 CFR 20.100.) 
‘‘Guaranteed lender’’: The proposed 
definition is identical to the current 
rule’s, and to the TIFIA statute’s, 
definition of ‘‘lender.’’ Applicants 
should note that the limitations the 
TIFIA statute imposes on the types of 
institutions which may qualify to be a 
‘‘guaranteed lender’’ do not affect or 
limit who may hold project obligations. 
‘‘Investment-grade rating’’: The 
proposed definition recognizes that 
some projects receiving TIFIA 
assistance, particularly those with 
private developers using bank financing 
rather than capital markets debt, may 
not have a public rating, and it makes 
clear that, although the investment- 
grade rating requirement still is 
imposed, the actual rating would not 
need to be published. The proposed 
definition also recognizes rating 
terminology used by rating agencies that 
have become identified by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) as 
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating 
Organizations (NRSROs) since the TIFIA 
rule was last published. The SEC 
engaged in a rulemaking, pursuant to 
the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 
2006,3 which modified the regulatory 
treatment of NRSROs.4 The TIFIA 
statute relies on the SEC’s determination 
of qualifications for NRSROs, 
irrespective of the regulatory regime the 
SEC uses for making such 
determination. 
‘‘Local servicer’’: The DOT services 
the TIFIA loan portfolio centrally and 
does not expect ever to use local 
servicers for TIFIA loans. In response, 
Congress eliminated the definition of 
‘‘local servicer’’ from the TIFIA statute 
and further expressed its intent that 
TIFIA loan servicing should be managed 
by a single entity 5; therefore, we 
propose to eliminate the definition of 
local servicer from the rule. 
‘‘Maturity date’’: The proposed 
definition recognizes that tying 
scheduled loan repayments to the date 
of substantial completion is not 
appropriate for credit assistance used to 
refinance long-term project obligations 
under 23 U.S.C. 603(a)(1)(C). Therefore, 
the proposed definition establishes the 
final maturity date for repayment of 
credit assistance used for refinancing 
purposes as the lesser of not later than 
35 years after the date the credit 
agreement is executed, or the useful life 
of the overall asset. 
‘‘Project’’: The proposed rule would 
expand the current rule’s definition to 
reflect the expanded definition 
contained in 23 U.S.C. 601(a)(8). In 
accordance with the SAFETEA-LU 
amendments, the proposed rule would 
permit TIFIA assistance for private 
freight-related rail facilities that serve a 
public benefit for highway users, which 
the proposed rule defines as the direct 
freight interchange between highway 
and rail carriers. In further accordance 
with the SAFETEA-LU amendments, the 
proposed rule would make eligible a 
group of such freight-related projects 
(e.g., bridge clearances throughout a rail 
corridor, traffic projects to improve port 
access) each of which separately might 
not be large enough to meet the 
threshold requirements, and surface 
transportation infrastructure 
improvements (e.g., road, rail, gate, 
equipment) necessary to facilitate direct 
intermodal transfer and access into and 
out of a port terminal. 
‘‘Project obligation’’: We propose to 
interpret the statutory definition 
contained in 23 U.S.C. 601(a)(9) to 
include a ‘‘loan’’ to make clear that a 
bank loan or other private debt, and not 
just capital markets debt, can be a 
‘‘project obligation’’ for purposes of the 
TIFIA program. With private entities 
now more frequently seeking TIFIA 
assistance, the DOT is sometimes 
presented with plans of finance relying 
on bank debt rather than capital markets 
debt for some or all of the non-TIFIA 
portion of the financing. Adding ‘‘loan’’ 
to the definition would make clear that 
in such financings bank debt would be 
treated as a project obligation. This is 
not intended to add any new forms of 
debt not currently available; rather it is 
intended to reflect TIFIA’s participation 
in bank financings. 
‘‘Project sponsor’’: The DOT believes 
that this definition no longer adequately 
characterizes those seeking or using 
TIFIA credit assistance. Generally, such 
an entity can be characterized as either 
an applicant or a borrower. If a public 
agency submits an application on behalf 
of multiple competing concessionaires, 
it can be characterized as an applicant. 
Therefore, we propose to eliminate this 
definition from the regulation. 
‘‘Rating agency’’: The proposed 
definition diverges from the statute only 
in its substitution of the word 
‘‘organization’’ for the words ‘‘rating 
agency’’ in order to eliminate the 
statutory language’s circularity. 
‘‘Refinance’’: The TIFIA statute at 23 
U.S.C. 603(a)(1)(c) uses ‘‘refinance’’ 
without defining the term; the DOT 
proffers a defined term. The proposed 
definition permits Borrowers to pay off 
existing project obligations and any

3491 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
6 ‘‘To be eligible to receive financial assistance 
under this chapter, a project shall meet the 
following criteria: Inclusion in transportation plans 
and programs.—The project shall satisfy the 
applicable planning and programming requirements 
of sections 134 and 135 at such time as an 
agreement to make available a Federal credit 
instrument is entered into under this chapter.’’ 23 
U.S.C 602(a)(1). 
7 ‘‘The project—(A) shall be included in the State 
transportation plan required under section 135; and 
(B) at such time as an agreement to make available 
a Federal credit instrument is entered into under 
this chapter, shall be included in the approved 
State transportation improvement program required 
under section 134.’’ Public Law 109–59, 
§ 1601(b)(1). 
8 Each State must develop a STIP that covers a 
period of 4 years and is updated at least every 4 
years. 23 U.S.C. 135(g)(1). 
9 While the House Bill does not make any change 
in threshold criteria, the Senate Bill says: ‘‘The 
change * * * clarifies the provision regarding 
statewide and metropolitan planning requirements. 
The existing provision contained language that 
could be misinterpreted to constrain TIFIA 
assistance in the case of a project with a 
construction timetable that extended beyond the 
typical three-year approved State Transportation 
Improvement Program (STIP).’’ H. Rept. 109–203 
(July 28, 2005) at H. 7458. The Conference 
Substitute accepts the Senate amendment without 
additional clarification: ‘‘Subsection (b) amends 
Section 182 of title 23 to clarify the requirements 
regarding statewide and metropolitan planning.’’ Id. 
at H. 7459. 
10 23 U.S.C. 602(a)(3). 
TIFIA credit assistance owed by the 
Borrower with funds acquired by the 
same Borrower (or its successor) 
through the creation of new project 
obligations and TIFIA credit assistance. 
‘‘Subsidy cost’’: The DOT proposes to 
change the defined term from ‘‘subsidy 
amount’’ to ‘‘subsidy cost’’ to reflect 
Federal credit terminology. 
‘‘Substantial completion’’: At 23 
U.S.C. 601(a)(14), the TIFIA statute 
defines this term to be ‘‘the opening of 
a project.’’ The DOT believes that the 
statute’s bare simplicity does not, in 
practice, always provide clear guidance, 
and that the Secretary has discretion to 
define, for a particular project, the 
circumstances constituting ‘‘substantial 
completion.’’ The current rule 
recognizes that discretion. Since 
publication of the current rule, the DOT 
has often, in individual TIFIA credit 
agreements, found it useful for both the 
DOT and the borrower to state explicitly 
in the credit agreement the precise 
circumstances the occurrence of which 
would constitute ‘‘substantial 
completion.’’ The proposed definition 
would continue to incorporate, with 
clarifying language changes, this 
beneficial use of Secretarial discretion. 
‘‘Term sheet’’: The proposed change 
in the definition of ‘‘term sheet’’ reflects 
a significant change in the procedure 
the DOT would use for entering into 
TIFIA agreements with borrowers. The 
term sheet would no longer be executed 
by both parties, but only by the DOT, 
and it would no longer serve as the 
instrument that the DOT uses to obligate 
Federal funds. The term sheet provides 
a transactional blueprint between the 
DOT and the borrower for the purposes 
of developing the credit agreement. The 
term sheet is subject to cancellation at 
any time for any reason at the discretion 
of the Secretary. Through this proposed 
administrative change, the DOT would 
create a single point—the execution of 
a credit agreement—when funds would 
be obligated. 
Section 80.5 Federal Requirements 
The current rule enumerates several 
specific Federal requirements set out in 
the TIFIA statute to which TIFIA funds 
are subject and adds to that list such 
other ‘‘requirements as applicable.’’ 
While carrying forward the statutorily 
specified requirements, the proposed 
rule would clarify the latter provision 
by providing that any such additional 
requirements would be imposed by 
Secretarial determination of 
applicability to a particular project. 
Each project would adhere to the 
requirements associated with the 
relevant DOT administration’s grant 
program. For example, under the 
Federal-aid highway program, most 
construction-related requirements apply 
only to those highway segments 
constructed with Federal assistance. A 
segment constructed without Federal 
assistance is not subject to these 
construction requirements. Because 
many TIFIA projects combine Federal 
grant and TIFIA assistance, adhering to 
the associated grant program 
requirements provides administrative 
efficiencies to the borrower and the 
relevant DOT administration. 
Section 80.7 Threshold Criteria for 
TIFIA Projects 
Eligibility for TIFIA financial 
assistance requires that the project 
satisfies the applicable planning and 
programming requirements of 23 U.S.C. 
134 and 135 at the time an agreement to 
make available a Federal credit 
instrument is entered into. 23 U.S.C. 
602(a)(1).6 Prior to the SAFETEA–LU 
amendments, eligibility required 
specifically that the project be included 
in an approved State Transportation 
Improvement Program (STIP) at the time 
an agreement to make available a 
Federal credit instrument was entered 
into.7 The NPRM proposes to conform 
the current threshold eligibility criteria 
for projects to changes mandated by the 
SAFETEA–LU amendments. 
The STIP is a multi-year 8, statewide 
listing of all transportation projects 
proposed for funding—Federal, State, 
and local. It must include all federally 
supported transportation expenditures 
within the State. 23 U.S.C. 123(g)(4)(A). 
Thus, a project funded by TIFIA 
financial assistance must be included in 
the STIP when an agreement to make 
available a Federal credit instrument is 
entered. 
Congress was apparently concerned 
that this requirement could be 
misinterpreted to constrain TIFIA 
assistance in the case of a project with 
a construction timetable that extended 
beyond the typical four-year approved 
STIP.9 We note that construction 
timetables for a project are not limited 
to the time horizon of a STIP; and multi- 
phase, large scale projects often appear 
on updated STIPs. There may be 
circumstances where the Department, 
on a case-by-case basis, should exercise 
the discretion to determine the 
applicable planning and programming 
requirements that apply to a TIFIA 
project at the time a credit assistance 
agreement is entered into, and we 
interpret the SAFETEA–LU 
amendments as providing this 
discretionary authority. 
The new provisions, mandated by the 
SAFETEA–LU amendments, would 
permit smaller projects to participate in 
the TIFIA program. SAFETEA–LU 
provided that the minimum size for 
TIFIA projects is $50 million or one- 
third of a State’s apportionment of 
Federal-aid funds, whichever is less; 
SAFETEA–LU also provided that the 
minimum size for TIFIA projects 
principally involving the installation of 
an intelligent transportation system is 
$15 million.10 The proposed rule would 
amend the current TIFIA rule to 
implement these new, lower minimum 
size thresholds, as applicable. 
The NPRM also proposes to amend 
the current rule to elaborate on the 
statutory language with respect to 
security to make clear that the term 
‘‘dedicated revenue sources’’ 
encompasses not just user fees, but also 
taxes pledged to secure the TIFIA 
instrument. The standard by which 
taxes are deemed pledged is the same as 
for any revenue pledged to secure the 
TIFIA loan, i.e., the legal and 
commercial terms of the credit 
agreement. The proposed rule 
essentially would retain the provision of 
the current rule under sections 
80.13(a)(4) and 80.13(c) permitting use 
of general obligation pledges or general 
corporate promissory pledges as 
security or ‘‘collateral’’ for TIFIA credit 
assistance. The policy of the 
Department, however, is that preference 
will be given to user financed projects. 
The proposed rule would continue the

current rule’s bar against securing a 
TIFIA instrument with a pledge of 
Federal funds from any source, 
including Federal-aid reimbursements. 
Section 80.9 Application Process 
The NPRM proposes to re-organize 
the existing rule’s various provisions 
relating to the TIFIA application and 
provides greater detail than the current 
rule about the application process. 
The NPRM proposes that, prior to 
submission of the TIFIA application, the 
applicant must have submitted a letter 
of interest satisfactory to the DOT. 
Although applications would be 
accepted only during prescribed 
periods, the DOT would continue to 
accept letters of interest at any time. 
The NPRM maintains the current 
rule’s requirement for the DOT to 
publish an annual Federal Register 
notice to solicit applications for credit 
assistance. In maintaining this 
provision, the DOT intends to return to 
the practice of specifying timeframes 
during which it will accept TIFIA 
applications. This use of application 
cycles will help DOT manage the TIFIA 
project pipeline and enable consistent 
use of the TIFIA selection criteria. This 
marks a departure from DOT practice 
since 2001 of accepting applications at 
any time during the year. 
The NPRM proposes to add a 
requirement that an applicant must 
submit with its application a working 
model of the project’s comprehensive 
plan of finance. The DOT’s current 
practice is to ask applicants to submit 
such models. As many applicants 
consider such models proprietary in 
nature, the DOT has not publicly 
disclosed them, and the DOT will 
continue to treat them as confidential 
commercial information. Applicants 
should prominently mark the model as 
confidential and proprietary 
information. Having access to the 
models has greatly enhanced the ability 
of the DOT and its financial advisors to 
analyze and understand the plans of 
finance for which TIFIA assistance is 
sought. The DOT believes that requiring 
applicants to include models with their 
application is necessary to evaluate 
applications, and will ensure our 
continued ability to conduct appropriate 
analysis of plans of finance for proposed 
TIFIA projects. 
The proposed rule would make clear 
that the preliminary rating opinion 
letters must be submitted with the 
application. The NPRM also proposes to 
include a provision that the Secretary 
may request such additional 
information as necessary to determine 
whether TIFIA assistance should be 
provided. 
Section 80.11 Preliminary Rating 
Opinion Letter and Investment-Grade 
Rating 
We propose to add a requirement that 
each applicant and borrower obtain a 
preliminary rating opinion letter and 
subsequent investment-grade rating 
from at least two rating agencies, and 
seek public comment on this proposal. 
We propose to add a requirement that 
the preliminary rating opinion letters 
and the subsequent ratings address the 
credit quality of the TIFIA instrument; 
i.e., the preliminary rating opinion letter 
must address the likely rating category 
of the TIFIA instrument, and the 
borrower must obtain a rating for the 
TIFIA instrument when it obtains the 
investment-grade rating for the project 
obligations. The DOT already draws 
substantially on the credit analysis work 
of the rating agencies, and this 
requirement would assist the internal 
capital allocation process that results in 
a subsidy cost estimate for each TIFIA 
transaction. 
To provide flexibility for a 
governmental agency seeking to make 
TIFIA assistance available to multiple 
potential borrowers as part of its 
solicitation of a private concession, the 
DOT is proposing to require submission 
of the credit ratings at a later stage in the 
process. In such an instance, the 
governmental agency must submit a 
TIFIA application that addresses the 
seven statutory criteria, and the selected 
concessionaire must provide the 
preliminary rating opinion letters with 
its submission of the project’s finance 
plan. 
The proposed rule would make clear 
that all debt senior to the TIFIA 
instrument must receive an investment- 
grade rating, not just the senior project 
obligations. While the DOT accepts 
multi-lien debt structures, it believes 
that a non-investment-grade lien senior 
to the TIFIA lien would not comport 
with the legislative intent underlying 
the investment-grade rating 
requirement. Thus, the DOT considers 
this proposed change a clarification of 
the TIFIA statute’s requirement. 
The proposed rule would require that 
the borrower deliver final ratings, and 
other such evidence related to the most 
current project financial plan upon 
which the rating evidence is based, to 
the DOT at least two weeks before the 
credit agreement closing in order to give 
the DOT adequate time to analyze any 
credit issues those ratings identify. This 
requirement will be restated in the 
project term sheet. 
The DOT believes that implicit in the 
statute’s investment-grade rating 
provision is a requirement that the 
TIFIA instrument itself attain an 
investment-grade rating if there are no 
project obligations senior to the TIFIA 
instrument. The statute, at 23 U.S.C. 
602(b)(2)(B), imposes such a 
requirement with respect to the 
preliminary rating opinion letter. The 
proposed rule would make that 
requirement explicit for both the 
preliminary rating opinion letter and the 
investment-grade rating. 
The proposed rule would elaborate 
and clarify the current rule’s 
specification that all TIFIA program 
credit rating requirements pertain to 
‘‘underlying’’ ratings. 
Section 80.13 Selection Criteria for 
TIFIA Projects 
As noted above, the DOT seeks 
comment on potential methods of 
incorporating benefit-cost analysis into 
the project selection process. 
The statute prescribes eight criteria 
for project evaluation, without 
specifying any relative weighting or 
whether any of the criteria is 
mandatory. The current rule assigns 
weights, ranging from 5 percent to 20 
percent, to each of the 8 statutory 
criteria. In the past, the DOT has 
assigned scores on a scale of zero to four 
to each of the eight criteria for all 
projects for which it has received 
applications and then weighted those 
scores to arrive at a composite score. 
The NPRM proposes to make several 
important changes to this framework: 
First, a project’s ‘‘creditworthiness’’ 
would now be evaluated separately. For 
every TIFIA project, the DOT analyzes 
the project economics and legal 
provisions supporting the Government’s 
credit security. This analysis is 
fundamentally important and should be 
treated separately from the other seven 
statutory criteria. The proposed rule 
would make creditworthiness a 
requirement. In order for a project to be 
selected for TIFIA assistance under the 
proposed rule, the Secretary must 
determine that it is creditworthy. This 
proposed requirement that a project 
must be determined to be creditworthy 
does not mean that a project’s TIFIA 
instrument, if subordinated to project 
obligations which are investment-grade 
itself, would be required to be 
investment-grade. Guidelines on how 
DOT will evaluate and determine 
creditworthiness will be published and 
updated regularly in the TIFIA program 
guidance. 
In addition, should project selection 
and ranking continue to consist of a 
weighted scoring of statutory criteria, 
the DOT proposes to realign the weights 
assigned to the remaining seven criteria 
to match national transportation

3493 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
11 See section V, paragraph 4 of OMB Circular A– 
129, ‘‘Managing Federal Credit Programs’’ 
(November 2000). This Circular is available at the 
following URL: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ 
circulars/a129/a129rev.html. 
12 The DOT publishes detailed guidance for TIFIA 
borrowers in a Program Guide. The Program Guide 
also includes the TIFIA application form and the 
text of both the TIFIA statute and the TIFIA rule, 
and will post a form loan template. The Program 
Guide may be found on the TIFIA Web site at: 
http://tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/. 
policies and the goals of reducing 
congestion and improving system 
performance. Because creditworthiness 
would be evaluated separately, the 
weights attached to these criteria would 
be changed so that the seven weightings, 
as revised, would total 100 percent. The 
DOT retains the discretion not to 
advance projects that rate low in these 
seven criteria even if the project is 
creditworthy. 
Under the current rule, the extent to 
which a project is nationally and 
regionally significant is weighted at 20 
percent of the total score, and is scored 
based on the extent to which a project 
generates economic benefits, supports 
international commerce, or otherwise 
enhances the national transportation 
system. The proposed change would 
increase the weight to 40 percent and 
reorganize the evaluation factors by 
creating 2 subcategories, and assigning 
each subcategory a percentage of the 
total weight for this criterion. Under the 
proposed revision, national and regional 
significance would be assessed based 
on: (A) The ability of a project to 
enhance the national or regional 
transportation system by reducing 
congestion and improving overall 
system performance on a sustainable 
basis (30 percent), and (B) the extent to 
which the project generates economic 
benefits beyond those captured under 
(A) and furthers interstate or 
international commerce (10 percent). 
To accommodate the increased 
emphasis on national and regional 
significance, the DOT proposes to 
reassign the weights given to the 
following criteria: Likelihood that 
Federal credit assistance would enable 
the project to proceed at an earlier date 
than the project would otherwise be 
able to proceed (5 percent; currently 
12.5 percent); extent to which the 
project helps maintain or protect the 
environment (10 percent; currently 20 
percent); extent to which the project 
uses new technologies (10 percent; 
currently 5 percent); and amount of 
budget authority required to fund the 
Federal credit instrument made 
available (10 percent; currently 5 
percent). The DOT proposes to evaluate 
the budget authority criterion by 
measuring the amount of TIFIA budget 
authority required to fund the Federal 
credit instrument relative to the total 
project investment. 
Weights for the remaining two 
criteria—private participation (20 
percent) and reduced Federal grant 
assistance (5 percent)—would remain as 
under the current rule. 
The proposed rule would clarify the 
DOT’s preference for applications for 
TIFIA loan guarantees over applications 
for secured loans and lines of credit. 
Such a preference is in accordance with 
Federal credit policies, as expressed in 
OMB Circular A–129, and is further 
reflected in proposed section 80.23(d)(6) 
below concerning refinancing of 
existing debt. The DOT seeks comments 
on how to increase the participation of 
private sector lenders in providing 
guaranteed loans consistent with the 
TIFIA statute and government-wide 
credit policy. 
Section 80.15 Term Sheet 
We propose to add a new section on 
term sheets that would make significant 
changes in how the DOT uses the TIFIA 
program term sheet and in how we 
obligate Federal funds for TIFIA 
projects. 
Currently, the term sheet is a letter 
contract between the DOT and the 
borrower, and the DOT uses it to 
obligate budget authority. The DOT 
proposes to streamline loan 
administration and use the term sheet as 
an expression of the DOT’s intent to 
proceed to negotiation of a credit 
agreement with the borrower. Budget 
authority would be obligated at the time 
the credit agreement is executed rather 
than, as is the current practice, at the 
time the term sheet is executed. 
Because the term sheet would no 
longer be used to obligate current year 
budget authority, we propose to 
eliminate the ‘‘conditional term sheet’’ 
provided for in the current rule. To aid 
budgetary planning, the DOT may issue 
future-year term sheets which, like 
current-year term sheets, also would be 
cancellable at any time by the DOT at 
its own discretion. 
Section 80.17 Interest Rate on Federal 
Credit Instruments 
The proposed rule contains language 
that would implement the TIFIA 
statute’s various interest rate provisions. 
Under the amended TIFIA statute, the 
interest rate on both TIFIA secured 
loans and TIFIA lines of credit is set at 
the time the credit agreement is 
executed, and this requirement is set 
forth in the proposed rule. The 
proposed rule provides that the rate on 
a guaranteed loan would be negotiated 
between the borrower and the 
guaranteed lender, but in accordance 
with the TIFIA statute, makes such 
negotiated rate subject to the Secretary’s 
approval. 
The proposed rule provides, in 
accordance with Federal credit 
policies,11 that all TIFIA credit 
agreements impose an interest rate 
penalty on outstanding loan balances in 
the event of a development default. DOT 
will publish guidelines on development 
default penalties in its program 
guidance. 
The TIFIA statute specifies only a 
lower bound on the interest rate for a 
TIFIA instrument: The rate on United 
States Treasury securities of a similar 
maturity. The current rule contains no 
provision implementing the statute’s 
rate-setting provisions. Under both the 
statute and the current rule, therefore, 
the DOT currently has broad discretion 
to set the interest rate so long as the rate 
is at or above the statutory minimum. In 
administering the TIFIA program, 
however, the DOT has set the rate, in all 
transactions to date, at the statutory 
minimum. As noted above, the DOT 
seeks comment regarding the use of its 
authority to charge different interest 
rates to different borrowers, on the basis 
of program policy goals and guidance in 
OMB Circular A–129. 
The current rule is silent on the 
calculation method by which the 
statutory minimum is determined. The 
DOT has determined the statutory 
minimum for a specific transaction by 
reference on the closing date to the rate 
table, published daily by the Treasury 
Department, for State and Local 
Government Series (SLGS) securities, 
and we have previously noted in the 
TIFIA Program Guide that we use this 
method of determining interest rate 
minimums. The NPRM proposes to 
incorporate into the regulation the 
calculation method for interest rate 
minimums heretofore noted in the 
Program Guide.12 
Section 80.19 Guaranteed Loans; 
Eligibility Requirements for Guaranteed 
Lenders 
The NPRM proposes to include a new 
section to provide that the terms of a 
guaranteed loan, including the interest 
rate, would be subject to approval by the 
Secretary. The proposed new section 
also specifies eligibility requirements 
for guaranteed lenders and would 
require that the Secretary approve all 
guaranteed lenders. Currently, eligibility 
standards for guaranteed lenders are set

forth in the TIFIA Program Guide.13 The 
DOT believes these eligibility standards 
should instead be incorporated in the 
regulation. 
Section 80.21 Draws on Line of Credit 
The proposed rule would move the 
current rule’s line of credit provisions, 
contained in 49 CFR 80.5, into a new 
section with modifications to 
implement the changes made by the 
SAFETEA–LU amendments to the TIFIA 
statute. The proposed rule would limit 
draws that are made to pay debt service 
on project obligations to the payment of 
debt service on those project obligations 
which financed eligible project costs, 
and it requires that draws for the 
purpose of paying debt service may not 
be made until any capitalized interest 
fund is exhausted. Consistent with the 
changes in SAFETEA–LU, the proposed 
rule would make clear that a draw for 
payment of debt service may be made 
even if a debt service reserve fund is 
available, thereby enabling borrowers to 
use a line of credit to avoid the default 
which usually arises when a debt 
service reserve fund is drawn. 
There would be no limitation in the 
amount that may be drawn under a line 
of credit in any one year, reflecting an 
amendment to the TIFIA statute. 
Section 80.23 Refinancing 
This proposed rule creates a new 
section on refinancing to implement the 
new TIFIA refinancing authority created 
by SAFETEA–LU and contained in 23 
U.S.C. 603(a)(1). In addition, the current 
rule’s provision dealing with 
refinancing of interim construction 
financing not more than one year after 
substantial completion is moved into 
this proposed new section. 
SAFETEA–LU amended TIFIA to 
permit the use of TIFIA secured loans 
and loan guarantees in certain 
refinancing transactions. In general, the 
new provision authorizes the Secretary 
to enter into TIFIA secured loan 
agreements, or loan guarantee 
agreements, to refinance long-term 
project obligations, or Federal credit 
instruments, if such refinancing will 
provide additional funding capacity that 
will be used to fund the completion, 
enhancement, or expansion of a project. 
This proposed new section provides 
guidance on the types of refinancing 
transactions the DOT will consider for 
TIFIA credit assistance and specifies 
application requirements and certain 
refinancing terms that the DOT believes 
are consistent with Federal credit 
policies. In addition, in order to 
minimize displacement of private sector 
credit markets while achieving program 
goals, the DOT proposes to participate 
in a qualified refinancing only by means 
of a TIFIA loan guarantee. As noted in 
the section 80.13 discussion above, the 
DOT seeks comments on how to 
increase the participation of private 
sector lenders in providing guaranteed 
loans consistent with the TIFIA statute 
and government-wide credit policy. 
The DOT’s new refinancing authority 
continues the TIFIA program’s principle 
emphasis: Stimulating investment in 
new transportation infrastructure. 
The DOT will require the applicant to 
demonstrate that the refinancing will 
increase available funding capacity for 
the completion, enhancement, or 
expansion of a project that qualifies for 
funding under 23 U.S.C. 602. The new 
improvement facilitated as part of the 
TIFIA refinancing must cost at least $50 
million (in eligible project costs) 
consistent with the SAFETEA–LU 
statutory minimum threshold for a new 
TIFIA project. The DOT notes that 
certain selection criteria tend to favor a 
project comprised entirely of new 
construction over one that includes the 
refinancing of existing project debt. 
While the new transportation project 
must follow the same Federal 
requirements as any TIFIA project, the 
DOT believes that an asset previously 
financed with the debt being refinanced 
under the TIFIA program is subject to 
those Federal requirements to which it 
was previously subject, including 
applicable Federal requirements 
concerning operations, maintenance, 
and design standards for future 
construction for a project receiving 
TIFIA refinancing assistance. 
A borrower will have the flexibility to 
apply the proceeds of a TIFIA 
guaranteed loan to the refinancing, the 
new project, or apportion an amount to 
each element of the transaction. It is not 
required that guaranteed loan proceeds 
be used to build the new project. If the 
guaranteed loan is made available for 
both the refinancing and the new 
project, the assistance will be structured 
in two tranches. The proposed rule 
establishes a maximum maturity date of 
35 years from the date the credit 
agreement is executed for the portion of 
credit assistance used for the 
refinancing. The maximum maturity 
date for the new project will be 35 years 
from the date of substantial completion, 
the same as for any new project 
receiving TIFIA credit assistance. In no 
case will the term of the loan guarantee 
exceed the useful life of the asset being 
financed. 
The DOT is proposing to provide 
credit assistance in connection with a 
refinancing in an amount no greater 
than the eligible project costs of the new 
transportation investment that is 
facilitated through the additional 
funding capacity provided by the 
refinancing. However, to provide an 
incentive to the private sector to invest 
in transportation infrastructure, 
consistent with the objectives of the 
TIFIA program, DOT may approve an 
increase in this limit up to an amount 
equal to the amount of equity actually 
committed at financial close. For any 
refinancing transaction, the maximum 
amount of credit assistance is limited to 
33 percent of the combined total of 
eligible project costs of the refunding 
and new project. 
The DOT considers that generating 
new investment in transportation is the 
essential purpose of a TIFIA-assisted 
refinancing transaction. For that reason, 
it will require that construction of the 
new project commence within a 
reasonable period of time. This 
requirement will apply even if the new 
construction is financed from sources 
other than TIFIA. To ensure timely 
advancement and completion of project 
construction, the DOT will require a 
penalty interest rate in the guaranteed 
loan in the event there is a development 
default. Guidelines on development 
default penalties for refinancing 
transactions will be published in the 
TIFIA program guidance. 
An applicant seeking TIFIA 
refinancing assistance must submit an 
application, including the new 
transportation asset construction 
project, using the TIFIA application 
form contained in the DOT’s TIFIA 
Program Guide. The application should 
describe in detail the refinancing plan of 
finance and demonstrate that it 
conforms to statutory and regulatory 
requirements. The fee for a refinancing 
application is proposed to be the same 
as the fee for a new TIFIA project 
application. 
Section 80.25 Limitations on Federal 
Credit Assistance 
The proposed rule would impose 
certain limitations on TIFIA assistance. 
Amount of credit assistance: The 
current rule incorporates the statutory 
limitation of 33 percent of reasonably 
anticipated eligible project costs, and 
the proposed rule would retain that 
provision. In addition, we propose to 
incorporate the new statutory provision, 
contained in 23 U.S.C. 603(b)(2), further 
limiting the amount of TIFIA credit 
assistance to the sum of project 
obligations senior to the TIFIA 
instrument when the TIFIA instrument

does not have an investment-grade 
rating. 
Look-back in determining project 
costs: The current rule permits costs 
incurred prior to submission of the 
TIFIA application to be included in the 
calculation of eligible project costs if 
approved by the Secretary. The 
proposed rule would permit costs 
incurred up to three years prior to the 
TIFIA application to be used in the 
calculation of eligible project costs, 
while allowing for further look-backs 
only in exceptional circumstances and if 
approved by the Secretary. However, the 
proposed rule would limit the 
consideration of such total costs to no 
more than 20 percent of total eligible 
project costs. 
Operating costs during construction: 
The proposed rule clarifies that the 
operating costs of a special purpose 
entity formed solely to construct and 
operate the facility for which the TIFIA 
credit assistance is provided would be 
included in the calculation of eligible 
project costs. The proposed rule would 
limit the consideration of such total 
costs to no more than 5 percent of total 
eligible project costs. 
Lease acquisition payments or 
concession fees: To be considered 
eligible project costs, payments to a 
public entity associated with the lease 
acquisition or concession fee must be 
dedicated to transportation projects 
eligible under title 23 or chapter 53 of 
title 49, United States Code. Lease 
acquisition payments must be part of a 
project in which new capital costs 
constitute a significant portion of 
project costs and represent fair market 
value. In other words, the concession 
fee, in and of itself, does not comprise 
an eligible project cost. In order to 
implement this policy, the DOT 
proposes to limit its consideration of 
such concession payments to 25 percent 
of total eligible project costs and seeks 
public comment on this proposal. 
Timing of funding of assistance: The 
current rule specifies that the DOT will 
fund a secured loan ‘‘based on a 
project’s funding needs.’’ In practice, 
the DOT has funded TIFIA loans on a 
reimbursement basis; i.e., borrowers 
may draw funds only for the payment of 
costs already incurred. This 
reimbursement practice aligns TIFIA 
assistance with assistance provided to 
Federal-aid grant-funded projects. In 
addition, the DOT has typically 
included in the credit agreement a 
provision specifying the maximum 
frequency (e.g., monthly or quarterly) 
with which draw requests can be 
submitted. Therefore, we propose to 
incorporate these practices into the 
regulation. 
Section 80.27 Credit Agreement 
Closing and Obligation of Funds 
The proposed new section states that 
obligation of Federal funds would occur 
at the closing of the credit agreement, 
thus making clear that the DOT is 
changing its current practice of 
obligating funds at the time a term sheet 
is executed. 
Section 80.29 Reporting Requirements 
and Credit Monitoring 
The proposed rule reorganizes the 
current rule to consolidate within a 
single section all reporting and 
monitoring requirements. The NPRM 
proposes to provide that the DOT may 
impose, in a particular credit agreement, 
additional reporting requirements 
which it considers necessary in order to 
properly monitor the credit performance 
of the specific project. 
The proposed rule moves the current 
rule’s annual credit reporting 
requirement to this section. It would 
require borrowers to maintain a credit 
rating at their own expense and furnish 
it annually to the DOT. The current rule 
requires borrowers to provide ongoing 
credit evaluations to the DOT annually. 
The proposed rule makes clear that such 
credit evaluations must be current credit 
ratings. It is not the intent of this 
provision to require borrowers with 
project obligations that have published 
credit ratings to obtain new ratings, but 
rather merely to require that the 
borrower establish that such ratings are 
still in effect. Borrowers which do not 
have project obligations with published 
credit ratings, such as borrowers which 
use bank debt and fulfill the statutory 
investment-grade rating requirement by 
obtaining a private rating, would be 
required to obtain a credit rating each 
year. 
The current rule provides that the 
DOT may conduct periodic financial 
and compliance audits of TIFIA 
borrowers. The proposed rule would 
make clear that such audits conducted 
by the DOT are at the borrower’s 
expense. 
Section 80.31 Fees 
Consistent with section 603(b)(7), 
section 604(b)(9), and 605(b) of title 23, 
United States Code, the proposed rule 
identifies several fees the DOT would 
assess program participants to recover 
the program’s various administrative 
and transactional costs. The following 
fees cannot be considered eligible 
project costs for the purpose of 
calculating the maximum amount of 
credit assistance. 
The proposed rule would not specify 
amounts for fees that are fixed, i.e., fees 
that are not transaction-based, namely 
the application fee and the servicing fee. 
The DOT needs to retain the flexibility 
to change these fixed fees from time to 
time, in response to changes in its own 
costs. Thus, rather than specify the fee 
amounts in the regulation, the DOT 
would announce changes in these fees 
by notice published from time to time 
in the Federal Register. A schedule of 
fees currently in effect will also be 
posted on the TIFIA Web site. 
The current rule prohibits payment of 
the application fee or the processing fee 
by anyone other than the applicant. The 
DOT is not aware of any circumstance 
where such fees were not paid by the 
applicant or an affiliated entity; even if 
a third party were to pay such fees, the 
DOT does not believe the TIFIA 
program would be adversely affected. 
The DOT has concluded this prohibition 
is unnecessary, and thus proposes to 
eliminate it. 
The NPRM proposes that the DOT 
would assess the following fees: 
1. Application fee. The applicant 
would be required to remit the 
application fee with its application for 
TIFIA assistance. There would be a 
single application fee for each 
application, irrespective of the number 
of TIFIA instruments the applicant is 
seeking. The current rule provides that 
the application fee is non-refundable, 
and the proposed rule would leave that 
provision unchanged. The purpose of 
the application fee is to cover, in part, 
the DOT’s cost for outside consulting 
services engaged to assist in reviewing 
the application. The amount of the 
application fee will be posted on the 
TIFIA Web site. The DOT may change 
the amount of the application fee from 
time to time, and will publish these 
changes in the Federal Register and 
post on the TIFIA Web site. The 
application fee is not considered an 
eligible project cost for the purpose of 
calculating the maximum amount of 
credit assistance. 
2. Subsidy fee. As authorized by 
section 603(b)(7) and section 604(b)(9) 
of Title 23, United States Code, the 
current rule, in section 80.17(c), permits 
the payment of a supplemental fee to 
reduce the subsidy cost of a project. The 
proposed rule would identify this as a 
‘‘subsidy fee’’ and restate the current 
rule’s language. If, in any given year, 
there is insufficient budget authority to 
fund the credit instrument for a 
qualified project that has been selected 
to receive assistance under TIFIA, the 
DOT and the approved applicant may 
agree upon a supplemental fee to be 
paid by or on behalf of the approved 
applicant at the time of execution of the 
term sheet to reduce the subsidy cost of

that project. Although such a fee has yet 
to be imposed, the DOT anticipates use 
of this provision as the demand for 
TIFIA assistance increases. The subsidy 
fee is not considered an eligible project 
cost for the purpose of calculating the 
maximum amount of credit assistance. 
3. Transaction fee. The transaction fee 
would be a one-time fee, set at an 
amount sufficient to reimburse the DOT 
for the actual costs, other than Federal 
employee costs, incurred in evaluating 
the application and negotiating the 
credit agreement. Such costs consist 
principally of fees the DOT pays to its 
consultants and outside legal advisors. 
The transaction fee would be due at 
closing of the credit agreement or within 
30 days of financial close as specified in 
the credit agreement. The proposed rule 
provides that the transaction fee would 
be an obligation of the applicant, 
payable irrespective of whether or not 
the credit agreement was ever executed. 
The transaction fee is not considered an 
eligible project cost for the purpose of 
calculating the maximum amount of 
credit assistance. 
4. Servicing fee. The DOT would 
assess the servicing fee annually in 
accordance with section 605(b)(1)(B) of 
SAFETEA–LU. There would be a 
servicing fee for each credit instrument 
so that a single borrower could be 
assessed more than one servicing fee. 
The servicing fee would offset, in part, 
the DOT’s costs in servicing its portfolio 
of TIFIA loans. The amount of the 
servicing fee will be posted on the 
TIFIA Web site. The DOT may change 
the amount of the servicing fee from 
time to time, and will publish these 
changes in the Federal Register and 
post on the TIFIA Web site. The 
servicing fee is not considered an 
eligible project cost for the purpose of 
calculating the maximum amount of 
credit assistance. 
5. Monitoring fee. The DOT would 
include in each credit agreement a 
provision obligating the borrower to 
reimburse the DOT for costs incurred in 
connection with monitoring the credit 
performance of a project, the 
enforcement of credit agreement 
provisions, amendments to the credit 
agreement and related documents, and 
other performance-related activities in 
accordance with section 603(b)(7) of 
SAFETEA–LU. The monitoring fee is 
not considered an eligible project cost 
for the purpose of calculating the 
maximum amount of credit assistance. 
The proposed rule provides that the 
DOT would seek administrative offset to 
recoup the above fees in the event the 
applicant or borrower fails to pay them. 
Section 80.33 Use of Administrative 
Offset 
The proposed rule carries forward the 
current rule’s provision making clear 
that the DOT does not intend to recoup 
by means of administrative offset losses 
incurred through TIFIA credit 
instruments except under circumstances 
relating to fraud, misrepresentation, 
false claims or similar acts. It clarifies 
the DOT’s intent, as stated in the rule, 
to recover through administrative offset 
any fees assessed under the TIFIA 
program and not paid. 
Section 80.35 Program Guide; TIFIA 
Web site 
The proposed rule would establish a 
new section advising those interested in 
the TIFA program of the TIFIA Program 
Guide and the TIFIA Web site (http:// 
tifia.fhwa.dot.gov). The proposed new 
section would be informational only, 
intended to notify the public of where 
to find additional program information, 
including information relating to a fee 
schedule. 
Section 80.37 Applicant Information 
Requirements 
The proposed rule would establish a 
new section addressing certain 
requirements that apply to all recipients 
of Federal assistance, including entities 
receiving credit assistance. First, an 
applicant must obtain a Data Universal 
Number System (DUNS) number. The 
DUNS number, which is a unique nine- 
character number that identifies an 
organization, is a tool used by the 
Federal Government to track how 
Federal money is distributed. Second, 
an applicant must register with the 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). 
The Federal Government requires that 
Federal agencies collect certain 
information from recipients of Federal 
assistance. This information is collected 
through the CCR system, which is the 
primary registrant database for the 
Federal Government. Registration in the 
CCR requires a DUNs number. 
Distribution and Derivation Tables 
For ease of reference, distribution and 
derivation tables are provided for the 
current sections of the proposed rule as

Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review) and U.S. DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
The DOT has determined 
preliminarily that this action would be 
an economically significant regulatory 
action within the meaning of Executive 
Order 12866, and that it would it be 
significant within the meaning of 
Department of Transportation regulatory 
policies and procedures because it 
implements important changes made to 
statutory law and makes a number of 
substantive changes to the current TIFIA 
regulation. Our determination is based 
on the activity to date of the program, 
which has had an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more. 
This action proposes to update and 
streamline the DOT’s regulation on 
Credit Assistance for Surface 
Transportation Projects. It implements 
the changes SAFETEA–LU made to the 
TIFIA statute, and reorganizes the 
current rule to make it more 
comprehensible to users. 
As of May 2008, the TIFIA program 
has provided approximately $4.8 billion 
in Federal credit assistance which has 
supported an aggregate of $18.6 billion 
in combined public and private sector 
capital investment, at a budgetary cost 
of approximately $346 million. 
The proposed regulation would affect 
only those entities that elect to apply for 
TIFIA assistance and are selected to 
receive a Federal credit instrument. It 
would not impose any direct costs on 
non-participants. 
Recognizing the significant impact of 
this program, SAFETEA–LU directed 
the Secretary of Transportation to 
submit biannually to Congress a report 
summarizing the financial performance 
of the projects receiving assistance 
under the TIFIA credit program. Two 
reports have been submitted to date, and 
a June 2008 report was recently 
submitted. The June 2006 report briefly 
updates financial information originally 
presented in the Department’s 
comprehensive June 2002 report to 
Congress.14 
The DOT and industry research has 
indicated that there are economic 
productivity gains to be derived from 
efficient capital investment in surface 
transportation facilities. According to a 
2005 GAO report, ‘‘[t]ransportation 
improvements also lead to increased 
productivity and economic growth, 
through improving access to goods and 
services for businesses and individuals 
and increasing the geographic size of 
potential labor pools for employers and 
potential jobs for individuals.’’ 15 This 
GAO report cited a September 2003 
study, which estimated that average 
annual returns on highway investment 
of approximately 14 percent between 
1990 and 2000.16 The DOT continues 
research, updating the returns on 
highway capital investment for 2000– 
2005. Preliminary results show positive 
returns but lower than the 1990–2000 
time period. TIFIA can serve to 
efficiently allocate public and private 
investment in surface transportation 
infrastructure and encourage de- 
politicizing investments. In addition to 
the direct returns it produces, 
transportation capital investment 
typically generates spillover benefits, 
which may yield financial and non- 
financial benefits, such as reduced 
pollution, increased safety, improved 
international competitiveness, and 
enhanced accessibility. 
Just as transportation investment 
produces benefits, failure to invest 
results in cost increases. According to 
the DOT, ‘‘transportation system 
congestion is one of the single largest 
threats to our nation’s economic 
prosperity and way of life.’’ 17 In 2003, 
Americans lost 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 
billion gallons of fuel due to traffic jams, 
resulting in an estimated cost of $200 
billion per year.18 According to the 
Texas Transportation Institute, ‘‘The 
solutions to this problem will require 
commitment by the public and by 
national, state and local officials to 
increase investment levels and identify 
projects, programs and policies that can 
achieve mobility goals.’’ 19 
According to a recent study by the 
American Association of State Highway 
and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), 
the U.S. population will grow at a more 
rapid pace in the next 50 years than 
during the previous 50 years when the 
nation’s modern highway system was 
first being constructed. As a result of 
this growth, the number of vehicles on 
U.S. highways, estimated at 246 million 
in 2007 (compared to 65 million cars 
and trucks in 1955), could rise to nearly 
400 million by 2055. The AASHTO 
report also estimated that between 2004 
and 2035 truck tonnage could increase 
114 percent and rail tonnage could 
increase 63 percent; truck traffic, 
measured in trucks per day, per mile, is 
expected to more than double in the 
same period.20 
The TIFIA program was established to 
provide fractional credit assistance to 
major transportation infrastructure 
projects—such as highway, transit, 
passenger rail, certain freight facilities, 
and certain port projects—that have the 
potential of generating substantial 
economic benefits both regionally and 
nationally. In many cases, such projects 
are capable of being supported through 
direct user charges or dedicated revenue 
streams that can be used to access 
private capital and other non-Federal 
funding sources. The TIFIA program is 
designed to fill market gaps through 
providing supplemental and/or 
subordinate capital to such projects,

facilitating access to the capital markets 
or other financing sources for the 
majority of project funding needs. 
Through the TIFIA program’s leverage 
of limited Federal funds with private 
capital, these capital-intensive projects 
can be advanced without displacing 
smaller, more traditional grant- 
supported projects. Federal risk 
exposure is mitigated by substantial co- 
investment from non-Federal parties 
and the use of objective, market-based 
credit evaluation criteria. 
Through SAFETEA–LU, Congress 
authorized $122 million for each 
Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) from 2005 
through 2009. Under TEA–21, Congress 
had authorized up to a total of $530 
million for FFY 1999 through FFY 2003. 
These funds pay the subsidy cost to the 
Federal Government of providing credit 
assistance, and are available until 
expended by the DOT or reprogrammed 
by Congress. Based on experience, this 
funding amount can support more than 
$2 billion of average annual credit 
assistance. Under the terms of the 
legislation, the Federal share is limited 
to 33 percent of total eligible project 
costs. In many cases, however, the 
actual share of TIFIA assistance is 
considerably less. For example, the 
average request for TIFIA assistance by 
applicants to the TIFIA program 
between October 1998 and March 2007 
was approximately 26 percent of total 
project cost. 
Under the Federal Credit Reform Act 
of 1990 (FCRA), the amount of budget 
authority necessary to support a Federal 
credit instrument depends upon the 
subsidy cost (i.e., the estimated present 
value cost of estimated losses that will 
be incurred as a result of defaults, net 
of any fee income or recoveries on 
default). Each project is assigned a 
subsidy cost based upon an evaluation 
of its creditworthiness and the specific 
terms and conditions of the loan or loan 
guarantee agreement. As noted 
previously, since the inception of the 
TIFIA program, total subsidy costs have 
amounted to nearly $346 million, 
supporting approximately $4.8 billion 
in Federal credit with an aggregate of 
$18.6 billion in public and private 
capital investment. 
The TIFIA program can promote the 
efficient functioning of project delivery 
and the private markets, and can 
generate both direct and indirect 
benefits, including reduced congestion, 
greater mobility, improved safety, an 
enhanced environment, and greater 
economic growth, all of which further 
interstate commerce. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
In compliance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96–354, 5 U.S.C. 
601–612) the DOT has evaluated the 
effects of this proposed action on small 
entities and has determined 
preliminarily that the proposed action 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
The TIFIA program is generally 
intended to assist large transportation 
projects and large entities and has little 
effect on small entities. This action 
proposes to extend availability of TIFIA 
credit assistance to smaller projects than 
those heretofore eligible; thus, to the 
degree they affect small entities, the 
changes will have a positive effect on 
small entities by making it possible for 
such smaller projects to obtain Federal 
credit assistance. The DOT expects, 
nevertheless, that the bulk of TIFIA 
assistance will go to large projects and 
that most small entities will be 
unaffected by the proposed action. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
This proposed rule would not impose 
unfunded mandates as defined by the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Pub. L. 104–4, March 22, 1995, 109 
Stat. 48). The proposed updates are 
applicable only to Federal and federally- 
assisted programs. This proposed rule 
will not result in the expenditure by 
State, local, and tribal governments, in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$128.1 million or more in any one year 
(2 U.S.C. 1532). 
Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
This proposed action has been 
analyzed in accordance with the 
principles and criteria contained in 
Executive Order 13132, and the DOT 
has determined that this proposed 
action would not have a substantial 
direct effect or sufficient federalism 
implications on States that would limit 
the policymaking discretion of the 
States. The DOT has also determined 
that this proposed action would not 
preempt any State law or State 
regulation or affect the States’ ability to 
discharge traditional State governmental 
functions. 
Executive Order 12372 
(Intergovernmental Review) 
Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance Program Number 20.205, 
Highway Planning and Construction. 
The regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372 regarding 
intergovernmental consultation on 
Federal programs and activities apply to 
this program. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.), 
Federal Agencies must obtain approval 
from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct, sponsor, or 
require through regulations. This 
proposed rule does not contain 
information collection requirements for 
the purpose of the PRA. Since the 
inception of the TIFIA program, the 
DOT has never received 10 or more 
applications for Federal credit 
assistance in a single year. During the 
years the program has been in existence, 
the DOT has received an average of 
three TIFIA applications per year. 
Preparing a TIFIA application requires a 
significant commitment of resources on 
the part of the applicant, and even with 
the lower project-size thresholds 
enacted by the SAFETEA–LU 
amendments, the DOT does not expect 
to receive 10 or more applications for 
TIFIA assistance in a single year. If in 
the future it appears that there will be 
10 or more applications in a year, the 
DOT will take immediate steps to seek 
approval from OMB for an information 
collection control number, as required 
under the PRA. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
This proposed rule would make a 
number of changes in the way the TIFIA 
Federal credit assistance program is 
administered. As specified under 23 
U.S.C. 602(c)(2), each project obtaining 
such assistance under the TIFIA 
program is required to adhere to the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.) (NEPA). None of the changes this 
NPRM proposes would affect the 
applicability of NEPA to TIFIA projects. 
Therefore, this proposed rule would not 
have any effect on the quality of the 
environment. 
Executive Order 12630 (Taking of 
Private Property) 
This proposed action would not affect 
a taking of private property or otherwise 
have taking implications under 
Executive Order 12630, Government 
Actions and Interface with 
Constitutionally Protected Property 
Rights. 
Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform) 
This proposed action meets 
applicable standards in sections 3(a) 
and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, 
Civil Justice Reform, to minimize 
litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and 
reduce burden.

3502 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Executive Order 13045 (Protection of 
Children) 
We have analyzed this proposed 
action under Executive Order 13045, 
Protection of Children from 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks. This proposed action does not 
concern an environmental risk to health 
or safety that may disproportionately 
affect children. 
Executive Order 13175 (Tribal 
Consultation) 
The DOT has analyzed this proposal 
under Executive Order 13175, dated 
November 6, 2000, and believes that the 
proposed action will not have 
substantial direct effects on one or more 
Indian tribes; will not impose 
substantial direct compliance costs on 
Indian tribal governments; and will not 
preempt tribal law. Therefore, a tribal 
summary impact statement is not 
required. 
Executive Order 13211 (Energy Effects) 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Executive Order 13211, Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use. We have 
determined that it is not a significant 
energy action under that order because 
although it is a significant regulatory 
action under Executive Order 12866, it 
is not likely to have a significant 
adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution, or use of energy. Therefore, 
a Statement of Energy Effects under 
Executive Order 13211 is not required. 
Regulation Identification Number 
A regulation identification number 
(RIN) is assigned to each regulatory 
action listed in the Unified Agenda of 
Federal Regulations. The Regulatory 
Information Service Center publishes 
the Unified Agenda in April and 
October of each year. The RIN contained 
in the heading of this document can be 
used to cross reference this action with 
the Unified Agenda.

3504 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
(d) The Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property 
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 
U.S.C. 4601, et seq.); and 
(e) Other Federal and compliance 
requirements as may be applicable. 
§ 80.7 Threshold criteria for TIFIA projects. 
(a) To be eligible to receive a Federal 
credit instrument, a project must meet 
the following threshold criteria: 
(1) The project must have satisfied the 
applicable planning and programming 
requirements of section 134 and 135 of 
Title 23 of the United States Code; 
(2) The project must have eligible 
project costs that are reasonably 
anticipated to equal or exceed the lesser 
of $50 million or one-third of the 
amount of Federal-aid highway funds 
apportioned for the most recently 
completed fiscal year to the State in 
which the project is located, provided 
that: 
(i) In the case of a project principally 
involving the installation of Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS), eligible 
project costs shall be reasonably 
anticipated to equal or exceed $15 
million; and 
(ii) In the case of a project located in 
more than one State, eligible project 
costs must be reasonably anticipated to 
equal or exceed the lesser of $50 million 
or one-third of the amount of Federal- 
aid highway funds apportioned for the 
most recently completed fiscal year to 
the participating State that receives the 
least amount of such funds; and 
(3) The proposed Federal credit 
instrument must be secured by and 
payable from, in whole or in part, tolls, 
user fees, rentals, taxes, or other 
dedicated revenue sources. In order to 
fulfill the requirements of § 80.11, any 
of these dedicated revenue sources that 
secure any project obligations senior to 
or on a parity with the Federal credit 
instrument must also secure, in similar 
proportion, the Federal credit 
instrument. 
(b) In addition to or in lieu of the 
dedicated revenue sources specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Secretary may accept municipal general 
obligation pledges, general corporate 
promissory pledges, or other pledges 
and forms of collateral as security for a 
Federal credit instrument. 
(c) A pledge of Federal funds, 
regardless of source, may not be used to 
secure a Federal credit instrument. 
§ 80.9 Application process. 
(a) Letter of interest. Prior to 
submission of an application for Federal 
credit assistance, the applicant must 
have submitted to the DOT a letter of 
interest and been notified by the DOT 
that the letter of interest adequately 
addresses threshold criteria discussed in 
this paragraph. The letter of interest 
required by this section should describe 
the project, the project’s plan of finance, 
and the amount and type of Federal 
credit instrument(s) sought. An 
applicant who has been notified by the 
DOT that its letter of interest is 
satisfactory may apply for Federal credit 
assistance in accordance with the 
schedule set forth by the DOT. 
(b) At least once each fiscal year for 
which Federal assistance is available 
under this part, the DOT shall publish 
a Federal Register notice to solicit 
applications for credit assistance. Such 
notice will specify the relevant due 
dates, the estimated amount of funding 
available to support TIFIA credit 
instruments for the current and future 
fiscal years, contact name(s), and other 
details for that cycle of application 
submissions and funding approvals. 
(c) Application. An application for 
Federal credit assistance must provide: 
(1) Documentation sufficient to 
demonstrate that the project satisfies 
each of the threshold criteria in 49 CFR 
80.7; 
(2) The applicant’s confirmation that 
it has complied with the environmental 
clearance requirement of 49 CFR 80.9(a); 
(3) A description of the extent to 
which the project satisfies each of the 
selection criteria in 49 CFR 80.13; 
(4) A description of the project for 
which Federal credit assistance is 
sought, status of environmental and 
other major governmental permits and 
approvals, and the construction 
schedule; 
(5) A description of the applicant and 
borrower; 
(6) Historical information, if 
applicable, concerning the applicant’s 
financial condition, including, for 
example, independently audited 
financial statements and certifications 
concerning bankruptcies or 
delinquencies on other debt; 
(7) Current financial information 
concerning both the project and the 
applicant, and a comprehensive project 
plan of finance, including sources and 
uses of funds for the project and a 
forecast of cash flows available to 
service all project obligations and the 
Federal credit instrument(s). 
Spreadsheets and cash flows must be 
submitted in both hard copy and in the 
form of a working computer model. 
Computer models should include 
among other things intact logic 
functions and assumption drivers, all 
business cases considered by the 
borrower and project sponsors, and an 
analysis of expected returns for each 
source of capital; 
(8) If the Federal credit assistance 
applied for is not a loan guarantee, a 
statement as to why a loan guarantee 
would not be as useful as the Federal 
credit assistance sought; 
(9) Preliminary rating opinion letters 
from at least two rating agencies; and 
(10) Such additional information as 
the Secretary may from time to time 
prescribe. 
(d) An application for a project 
located in or sponsored by more than 
one State or other entity may be 
submitted to the DOT. The sponsoring 
States or entities must designate a single 
borrower for purposes of receiving and 
repaying the Federal credit instrument. 
§ 80.11 Preliminary rating opinion letter 
and investment-grade rating. 
(a) An applicant must submit with its 
application preliminary rating opinion 
letters from at least two rating agencies. 
The letters must be current and based 
on the same project plan of finance that 
is submitted as part of the TIFIA 
application per § 80.9(b)(7). Each 
preliminary rating opinion letter must 
provide a conditional credit assessment 
of the project’s overall creditworthiness 
and must specifically address: 
(1) The potential of all project 
obligations having a lien senior to that 
of the Federal credit instrument on the 
pledged security to achieve an 
investment-grade rating; and, 
(2) The likely credit rating category of 
the Federal credit instrument. 
(b) If a governmental agency is 
submitting an application on behalf of 
potential borrowers in connection with 
a concession procurement process, the 
governmental entity does not need to 
submit a preliminary rating opinion 
letter. Rather, the DOT will require the 
selected concessionaire seeking TIFIA 
assistance to provide the preliminary 
rating opinion letters, which meet all of 
the requirements of § 80.11(a), with its 
submission of its comprehensive 
financial plan. 
(c) Not later than 14 days prior to the 
closing of the credit agreement, the 
borrower must cause to be delivered to 
the DOT: 
(1) Satisfactory evidence, such as a 
rating letter or rating confirmation letter, 
that at least two rating agencies have 
assigned ratings: 
(i) To all project obligations that have 
a lien senior to that of the Federal credit 
instrument on the pledged security, 
which ratings must be investment-grade; 
and 
(ii) To the Federal credit instrument. 
(2) Other such evidence related to the 
most current project financial plan upon 
which the rating evidence is based. 
(d) If no project obligations have a 
lien senior to that of the Federal credit

instrument, then the requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
apply to the Federal credit instrument. 
(e) The ratings required by this 
section are underlying ratings. Neither 
the preliminary rating opinion letter, 
nor the investment-grade rating, may 
reflect the effect of bond insurance or 
other private credit enhancement, 
unless such private credit enhancement 
secures the Federal credit instrument. 
§ 80.13 Selection criteria for TIFIA 
projects. 
(a) For a project to be selected for 
Federal credit assistance, the Secretary 
must have determined that it is 
creditworthy. The Secretary’s 
determination will ensure that any 
financing for the project has appropriate 
security features, such as a rate 
covenant, to ensure repayment. 
Notwithstanding the creditworthiness of 
the project, the Secretary retains the 
discretion not to advance a project that 
is not highly rated under the criteria 
discussed below. 
(b) In addition to making a 
determination with respect to 
creditworthiness, the Secretary will 
consider the degree to which a project 
advances the policy objectives 
embodied in the following seven 
criteria. The Secretary will assign 
weights as indicated in evaluating and 
selecting which eligible projects will 
receive Federal credit assistance: 
(1) The extent to which the project is 
nationally or regionally significant, in 
terms of: 
(i) The ability of the project to 
enhance the national or regional 
transportation system by reducing 
congestion and improving overall 
system performance (30 percent); and 
(ii) The extent to which the project 
generates economic benefits not 
accounted for above in 80.13(b)(1)(i), 
and supports interstate and 
international commerce (10 percent). 
(Total: 40 percent); 
(2) The extent to which Federal credit 
assistance would foster innovative 
public-private partnerships and attract 
private debt or equity investment (20 
percent); 
(3) The likelihood that Federal credit 
assistance would enable the project to 
proceed at an earlier date than the 
project would otherwise be able to 
proceed (5 percent); 
(4) The extent to which the project 
uses new technologies, including 
Intelligent Transportation Systems 
(ITS), that enhances the efficiency of the 
project (10 percent); 
(5) The amount of budget authority, 
relative to total dollars invested in the 
project, required to fund the Federal 
credit instrument made available (10 
percent); 
(6) The extent to which the project 
helps maintain or protect the 
environment (10 percent); and 
(7) The extent to which such 
assistance would reduce the 
contribution of Federal grant assistance 
to the project (5 percent). 
(c) The Secretary will give preference 
to applications for loan guarantees 
rather than other forms of Federal credit 
instruments. Such preference is 
consistent with Federal credit policies 
under OMB Circular A–129 that state 
when Federal credit assistance is 
necessary to meet a Federal objective, 
loan guarantees should be favored over 
loans, unless attaining the Federal 
objective requires a subsidy, as defined 
by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
1990 (2 U.S.C. 661, et seq.), deeper than 
can be provided by a loan guarantee. 
§ 80.15 Term sheet. 
(a) When the Secretary has approved 
the project for Federal credit assistance 
processing, the Secretary will issue a 
term sheet to the approved applicant. 
Although the term sheet will be used to 
administratively reserve the requisite 
budget authority, it is subject to 
cancellation at the discretion of the 
Secretary. 
(b) Subject to the limitation of 33 
percent of eligible project costs, the 
Secretary may make a future-year 
administrative reservation of budget 
authority and the associated 
commitment of Federal credit 
assistance. This reservation will ensure 
that a project with a future reservation 
will have a priority (along with the 
priority of any other projects receiving 
such future reservations) on budget 
authority becoming available in the 
specified year(s). 
§ 80.17 Interest rate on Federal credit 
instruments. 
(a) Except as described in section (b) 
below, the interest rate on secured loans 
and lines of credit will be set at the 
discretion of the Secretary. 
(b) The minimum interest rate on 
secured loans and lines of credit will be 
set as follows: 
(1) The interest rate on a secured loan 
will be not less than the yield on United 
States Treasury securities of a similar 
maturity to the final maturity of the 
secured loan on the date of execution of 
the credit agreement. 
(2) The interest rate on any draw 
made on a line of credit will be not less 
than the yield on United States Treasury 
securities of a 30-year maturity on the 
date of execution of the credit 
agreement. 
(c) The interest rate on a guaranteed 
loan is the rate agreed to by the 
borrower and the guaranteed lender, 
subject to approval by the Secretary. 
(d) For purposes of this section, the 
DOT may determine the ‘‘yield on 
United States Treasury securities’’ by 
reference to the published rate for State 
and Local Government Series (‘‘SLGS’’) 
securities, adjusted as appropriate to 
reflect the market yield of publicly 
traded United States Treasury securities. 
(e) Consistent with Section V, 
Paragraph 4, of OMB Circular A–129, 
and 31 U.S.C. 3717, the DOT will 
include in the credit agreement a 
provision imposing a default interest 
rate. 
§ 80.19 Guaranteed loans; eligibility 
requirements for guaranteed lenders. 
(a) Terms of a guaranteed loan must 
be approved by the Secretary. 
(b) To participate in this program, a 
guaranteed lender must be approved by 
the Secretary and must: 
(1) Not be debarred or suspended 
from participation in any Federal 
program; 
(2) Not be delinquent on any Federal 
debt or loan; 
(3) Be duly organized and legally 
authorized to enter into the transaction; 
(4) Demonstrate experience in 
originating and servicing loans for large- 
scale developments; and 
(5) Have sufficient capital to originate 
the loan and disburse its own portfolio. 
(c) The Secretary will periodically 
review lender eligibility, consistent with 
Federal credit policies under OMB 
Circular A–129. 
§ 80.21 Draws on line of credit. 
(a) Use of proceeds. A borrower may 
draw on a line of credit to pay debt 
service on project obligations, 
extraordinary repair and replacement 
costs, operation and maintenance 
expenses, and costs associated with 
unexpected Federal or State 
environmental restrictions imposed 
after credit agreement closing; provided, 
however, that when the line of credit is 
drawn to pay debt service, it may be 
applied only to debt service on project 
obligations which were used to finance 
eligible project costs. 
(b) Eligibility to draw. A draw on the 
line of credit may be made only if net 
revenues from the project are 
insufficient to pay the costs specified in 
the preceding paragraph. With respect 
to any shortfall in the sufficiency of net 
revenues to pay debt service, a draw on 
the line of credit may be made only after 
application of any funds in a capitalized 
interest account. The borrower may 
draw on the line of credit before

drawing on a debt service reserve fund. 
A draw on the line of credit may not be 
made to replenish a debt service reserve 
fund. 
§ 80.23 Refinancing. 
(a) Proceeds of a secured loan 
provided under 23 U.S.C. 603 may be 
used to refinance interim construction 
financing of eligible project costs, 
provided that such refinancing is 
completed not later than one year after 
substantial completion. Otherwise 
secured loans used for this purpose are 
generally made available under the 
same provisions as loans under 23 
U.S.C. 603(a)(1)(A). 
(b) Except for the purpose described 
in section (a) above, proceeds of a 
secured loan provided under section 
603 of Title 23, United States Code may 
not be used to refinance long-term 
project obligations or Federal credit 
instruments. 
(c) Proceeds of a loan provided by a 
guaranteed lender receiving a TIFIA 
loan guarantee may be used to refinance 
long-term project obligations or Federal 
credit instruments if the project 
applicant demonstrates to the DOT’s 
satisfaction that such refinancing will 
provide at least $50 million of 
additional funding capacity and that 
such capacity will be used to fund the 
completion, enhancement, or expansion 
of a project that: 
(1) Is selected under section 602 of 
Title 23, United States Code, or 
(2) Otherwise meets the requirements 
of section 602 of Title 23, United States 
Code. 
(d) The fee for a refinancing 
application is the same as the fee for a 
new TIFIA project application. 
(e) The following special provisions, 
terms, and limitations are applicable to 
the Federal loan guarantee for a 
refinancing made available under 23 
U.S.C. 603(a)(1)(C): 
(1) The borrower will have the 
flexibility to apply the guaranteed loan 
proceeds to the refinancing, the new 
project, or apportion an amount to each 
element of the transaction. It is not 
required that the guaranteed loan 
proceeds be used to build the new 
project. However, Federal requirements 
(see § 80.5) will apply to the new 
project. 
(2) The loan guarantee made available 
in connection with a refinancing under 
this paragraph will be in an amount not 
larger than the greater of: 
(i) The amount applied to funding the 
completion, enhancement, or expansion 
of the project; and 
(ii) The amount of equity invested in 
the project, provided that in no event 
will the amount of the secured loan 
exceed 33 percent of the amount of the 
financing. 
(3) Returns and payouts on equity 
investments in a financing transaction 
under this paragraph must be 
subordinated to the Federal credit 
instrument for so long as the TIFIA debt 
is outstanding, consistent with OMB 
Circular A–129 requirements that 
business borrowers have equity at risk. 
(Appendix A, section II, 3a. (2)). 
(4) If the guaranteed loan proceeds are 
disbursed to fund both the refinancing 
of the long-term obligations and the 
completion, enhancement, or expansion 
of the project, the following provisions 
apply to the repayment: 
(i) The guaranteed loan will be 
structured in two tranches. The first 
tranche will be that portion funding the 
refinancing of the long-term obligations 
and the second tranche will be that 
portion funding the project. 
(ii) Repayments of principal or 
interest on the first tranche shall be 
scheduled to commence six months 
following the first disbursement of 
funds and to conclude, with full 
repayment of principal and interest, by 
the date that is the lesser of not later 
than 35 years after the date the credit 
agreement is executed, or the remaining 
useful life of the asset. 
(iii) Repayments of principal or 
interest on the second tranche shall be 
scheduled based on project cash flow 
and shall commence not later than five 
years after substantial completion of the 
capital improvement. The final maturity 
of the tranche shall be the lesser of no 
later than 35 years after substantial 
completion of the project, or the 
remaining useful life of the asset. 
(5) For improvements financed with 
guaranteed loan proceeds under this 
section, terms and conditions will be 
incorporated into the guaranteed loan 
agreement to ensure that the 
completion, enhancement, or expansion 
of the refinanced facility will commence 
and be completed within a reasonable 
period after the closing of the 
transaction. The DOT will require a 
binding commitment assuring the 
project will be completed and shall 
require a penalty interest rate on the 
guaranteed loan in the event of a 
development default. 
(6) An applicant seeking a TIFIA loan 
guarantee under this section must 
submit an application that addresses the 
proposed refinancing and the 
improvement(s) facilitated by the 
refinancing using the TIFIA application 
form contained in the DOT’s TIFIA 
Program Guide, describing in detail the 
plan of finance associated with the 
refinancing, and demonstrate 
conformance with TIFIA requirements, 
and how the refinancing will increase 
the funding capacity and enable the 
completion, enhancement, or expansion 
of the facility. 
(7) The improvement being financed 
with proceeds of a guaranteed loan must 
adhere to the requirements in § 80.5. 
§ 80.25 Limitations on Federal credit 
assistance. 
(a) The total dollar amount of Federal 
credit assistance offered to a project in 
the form of Federal credit instruments 
will not exceed the lesser of: 
(1) 33 percent of the reasonably 
anticipated eligible project costs, as 
measured on an aggregate cash (year-of- 
expenditure) basis; or 
(2) If the Federal credit instrument 
does not receive an investment-grade 
rating, the amount of project obligations 
senior to the Federal credit instrument. 
(b) The costs used to calculate eligible 
project costs may not include: 
(1) Costs incurred more than three 
years prior to the submission of an 
application for a Federal credit 
instrument unless exceptional 
circumstances exist, and inclusion of 
such costs is approved by the Secretary. 
(2) Costs incurred prior to submission 
of an application for a Federal credit 
instrument that are in excess of 20 
percent of total eligible project costs. 
(3) Operating costs incurred prior to 
substantial completion of the project by 
a special purpose entity formed solely to 
construct and operate the facility that 
are in excess of 5 percent of total 
eligible project costs. 
(c) To be considered eligible project 
costs, payments to a public entity 
associated with the lease acquisition or 
concession fee must reflect fair market 
value and be dedicated to transportation 
projects eligible under title 23 or 
chapter 53 of title 49, United States 
Code. Further, the eligibility of such 
payments is limited to 25 percent of 
total eligible project costs. The final 
amount of eligible project costs 
associated with such payments is 
subject to the approval of the Secretary. 
(d) Any loan made in connection with 
a credit agreement, whether a secured 
loan, a guaranteed loan, or a loan made 
by drawing on a line of credit, will be 
funded on a reimbursement basis, at 
such intervals as specified in the credit 
agreement. In the case of a secured loan 
or a guaranteed loan, the credit 
agreement will include the anticipated 
schedule for such loan disbursements, 
which schedule the parties may amend 
from time to time. 
§ 80.27 Credit agreement closing and 
obligation of funds. 
(a) Closing conditions. The DOT will 
enter into a credit agreement only when

the project to receive Federal credit 
assistance meets the following 
requirements: 
(1) The project or project elements, as 
appropriate, comply with applicable 
planning and programming 
requirements in 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135; 
(2) The project has received an 
environmental Categorical Exclusion, 
Finding of No Significant Impact, or 
Record of Decision; 
(3) The requirements of 49 CFR 80.11 
with respect to the investment-grade 
rating must have been satisfied; and 
(4) The project, if eligible pursuant to 
Section 5302 of 49 U.S.C., Chapter 53, 
has complied with 49 U.S.C. 5333(b) as 
evidenced by a letter from the U.S. 
Department of Labor. 
(b) Obligation of Federal funds. The 
DOT will obligate the subsidy amount at 
the time it executes the credit 
agreement. 
§ 80.29 Reporting requirements and credit 
monitoring. 
(a) Credit rating maintenance. 
Throughout the life of the Federal credit 
instrument, the borrower must obtain 
annually, at no cost to the Federal 
government, current credit evaluations 
of the project, the project obligations, 
and the Federal credit instrument. The 
current credit evaluations must be 
performed by a rating agency. In the 
case of an unpublished rating, the credit 
evaluation must consist of a formal 
credit rating letter. 
(b) Annual financial plan. Each 
recipient of Federal credit assistance 
must submit an annual financial plan, 
elements of which may be specified in 
the credit agreement, and audited 
financial statements to the DOT not later 
than 180 days following the recipient’s 
fiscal year-end for each year during 
which the Federal credit instrument 
remains outstanding. The annual 
financial plan must include a current 
credit evaluation, as described in the 
preceding paragraph 80.29(a). 
(c) The borrower will furnish the DOT 
with: 
(1) Any information it submits to any 
rating agency; and 
(2) Any report of which the borrower 
has knowledge relating to the project 
credit, whether prepared by a rating 
agency or other institution and 
irrespective of whether prepared at the 
direction of the borrower or otherwise. 
(d) Periodic audits. The DOT may 
periodically conduct, so long as a 
Federal credit instrument is 
outstanding, such financial and 
compliance audits as it deems 
necessary. Such audits will be at the 
borrower’s expense. 
(e) Additional reporting requirements. 
The DOT may require additional 
reporting requirements in the credit 
agreement which it deems necessary to 
enable it properly to monitor the credit 
performance of the project. 
§ 80.31 Fees. 
Section 603(b)(7) and section 
604(b)(9) of Title 23, United States 
Code, and Appendix A, Part II, Section 
3b of OMB Circular A–129 authorize the 
Secretary to establish fees at a level 
sufficient to recover all or a portion of 
the cost of making credit assistance 
available under the TIFIA program. The 
following fees are not considered 
eligible project costs for the purpose of 
calculating the maximum amount of 
credit assistance. 
(a) Application fee. An applicant must 
remit with its application for Federal 
credit assistance a non-refundable 
application fee. The amount of the 
application fee will be posted on the 
TIFIA Web site. The DOT may change 
the application fee from time to time by 
notice published in the Federal 
Register. 
(b) Subsidy fee. If, in any given year, 
there is insufficient budget authority to 
fund the credit instrument for a 
qualified project that has been selected 
to receive assistance under TIFIA, the 
DOT and the approved applicant may 
agree upon a supplemental fee to be 
paid by or on behalf of the approved 
applicant at the time of execution of the 
credit agreement to reduce the subsidy 
cost of that project. No such fee may be 
included among eligible project costs for 
the purpose of calculating the maximum 
33 percent credit amount referenced in 
§ 80.25(a). 
(c) Transaction fee. The DOT will 
assess each borrower a transaction fee to 
reimburse the DOT for its actual costs 
incurred in evaluating the application 
and processing the transaction, which 
transaction fee the borrower must pay 
not later than thirty days after closing. 
In the event a transaction does not result 
in a credit agreement closing, the 
approved applicant must pay the 
transaction fee not later than 30 days 
after notifying the DOT that it will no 
longer seek credit assistance, or if the 
approved applicant fails to give the DOT 
such notice, the Secretary establishes by 
objective evidence that the approved 
applicant is no longer seeking credit 
assistance and so notifies the approved 
applicant, not later than 30 days after 
such notification. 
(d) Servicing fee. The DOT will assess 
each borrower a servicing fee for each 
Federal credit instrument to reimburse 
the DOT for the costs of servicing 
Federal credit instruments. The amount 
of the servicing fee will be posted on the 
TIFIA Web site. The DOT may change 
the servicing fee from time to time by 
notice published in the Federal 
Register. 
(e) Monitoring fee. The DOT will 
include in each credit agreement terms 
and conditions obligating the borrower 
to reimburse the DOT for costs incurred 
in connection with monitoring the 
credit performance of a project, the 
enforcement of credit agreement 
provisions, amendments to the credit 
agreement and related documents, and 
other performance-related activities. 
§ 80.33 Use of administrative offset. 
(a) The DOT will not apply an 
administrative offset to recover any 
losses to the Federal Government 
resulting from project risk the DOT has 
assumed under a Federal credit 
instrument. 
(b) The DOT will employ an 
administrative offset to recover fees 
assessed under 49 CFR 80.31 and also 
in cases of fraud, misrepresentation, 
false claims, or similar criminal acts or 
acts of malfeasance or wrongdoing. 
§ 80.35 Program Guide; TIFIA Web site. 
(a) Program Guide. The DOT will from 
time to time publish updates to a TIFIA 
Program Guide, which will include 
updated information, a loan template, 
and may reflect modifications to the 
application process to provide more 
flexibility to project sponsors who are 
advancing projects as private 
concessions. Reference should be made 
to the Program Guide for additional 
information about the TIFIA program. 
(b) Web site. The DOT maintains a 
Web site for the TIFIA program: 
http://tifia.fhwa.dot.gov. The DOT will 
post on the TIFIA Web site: 
(1) Amounts of application fee and 
monitoring fee assessed under 49 CFR 
80.31; 
(2) Promptly after execution, each 
term sheet, and; 
(3) Promptly after closing of each 
credit agreement, the credit agreement 
for such transaction to the extent that 
the credit agreement does not contain 
confidential commercial information. 
(c) Additional information. 
Additional DOT records related to the 
TIFIA program may be requested 
through a Freedom of Information Act 
request pursuant to 49 CFR Part 7. 
§ 80.37 Applicant Information 
Requirements. 
An applicant must obtain a Data 
Universal Number System (DUNS) 
number and register on the Central 
Contractor Registration (CCR) site. 
These requirements apply to all 
recipients of Federal assistance,

Register on Monday, December 15, 2008 
(73 FR 75979) giving guidance regarding 
the distribution of stock of a controlled 
corporation acquired in a transaction 
described in section 355(a)(3)(B) of the 
Internal Revenue Code. This action is 
necessary in light of amendments to 
section 355(b). The text of those 
regulations also serves as the text of 
these proposed regulations. These 
regulations will affect corporations and 
their shareholders.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The correction notice that is the 
subject of this document is under 
section 355 of the Internal Revenue 
Code. 
Need for Correction 
As published, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking by cross-reference to 
temporary regulations (REG–150670–07) 
contains an error that may prove to be 
misleading and is in need of 
clarification. 
Correction of Publication 
Accordingly, the publication of the 
notice of proposed rulemaking by cross- 
reference to temporary regulations 
(REG–150670–07), which was the 
subject of FR Doc. E8–29545, is 
corrected as follows: 
On page 75980, column 2, under the
