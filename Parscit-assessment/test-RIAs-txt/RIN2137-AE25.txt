1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is proposing 
changes to the Federal pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 192, which cover the 
transportation of natural gas by pipeline.  Specifically, PHMSA proposes allowing 
natural gas transmission pipeline operators to use an alternative method to establish the 
maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) for certain pipelines (1) constructed of 
steel pipe manufactured using modern steel chemistry, rolling practices, and standards, 
and (2) inspected and tested to more rigorous standards.   
 
This report examines the benefits and costs of the proposed regulatory changes.  
Additionally, the report includes the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
Gas transmission pipelines in the U.S. use steel pipe almost exclusively.1  Under Federal 
pipeline safety regulations, steel transmission pipelines must use a MAOP corresponding 
to a stress level that is below the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) of the steel 
pipe.  Each pipeline class location has a different design factor and corresponding stress 
level, which are currently as follows: 
 
• Class 1:  72% of SMYS 
• Class 2:  60% of SMYS 
• Class 3:  50% of SMYS 
• Class 4:  40% of SMYS 
 
The estimated percentages of transmission mileage in these four class locations are 
 
• Class 1:  80%2 to 90%3 of mileage 
• Class 2:  5%4 to 10%5 of mileage 
• Class 3:  Less than 5%6 to 10%7 of mileage 
• Class 4:  Approximately 0.5% of mileage8

When Federal regulations were adopted in 1970, 72% of SMYS was selected as the upper 
limit for the design factor to ensure conservative safety margins.  The manufactured 
quality of steel pipe at the time necessitated the conservative safety margins.9  Since then, 
manufacturers have dramatically improved the quality of steel pipe.  Additionally, 
pipeline construction practices and operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures of 
pipeline operators have improved.  In response to the material, construction, and O&M 
advances, several nations, including Canada and the United Kingdom, have allowed 
pipelines to operate at up to 80% of SMYS.10  A few nations, including Japan and 
Germany, mandate a MAOP lower than 72% of SMYS.11   
 
In 1970, Federal regulators allowed pipelines that had operated successfully for many 
years at a stress level greater than 72% of SMYS to continue to operate at the higher 
stress level.  Currently, approximately five thousand miles of gas transmission pipelines 
in the U.S. are operating at a stress level that is greater than 72% of SMYS because of 
grandfathering.12  Operators desiring a MAOP greater than 72% of SMYS may apply to 
PHMSA for waivers (i.e., special permits).  When evaluating waiver applications, the key 
consideration for PHMSA is whether the pipelines can operate at higher stress level 
without compromising safety.   
 
Beginning in 2006, PHMSA evaluated requests for special permits from three companies 
seeking to operate natural gas transmission pipelines at higher pressures than currently 
allowed by regulation.  Those requests were made by  
 
• Alliance Pipeline L.P.13 
• Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C.14 
• Rockies Express Pipeline LLC15 
 
The requests were for proposed and existing pipelines, and all requested permission to 
operate at 80% of SMYS in the class 1 locations.  Some requests also included increases 
in the MAOP for other class locations.   
 
PHMSA afforded the public an opportunity to provide comments on each special permit 
request, and received favorable comments from both industry and the public.  
Additionally, PHMSA briefed its technical advisory committees, held a public meeting,

and brought stakeholders into the development of permitting criteria.  PHMSA received 
supportive comments at these meetings.   
 
PHMSA granted all three requested special permits.  In granting them, PHMSA required 
the operators to demonstrate compliance with certain design specifications and imposed 
additional safety standards.   
 
3. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
 
The proposed rule supports the Secretary of Transportation’s priorities by improving 
performance and harnessing 21st Century technologies.  Increasing operating pressure can 
ease supply constraints by boosting pipeline capacity by as much as 10 percent.  
Increasing capacity also enhances pipeline efficiency.  This enhanced performance is 
made possible by technological advances in metallurgy and pipe manufacture, as well as 
by improved pipeline lifecycle management practices.  Pipelines built with improved 
steel pipe and operated in compliance with improved lifecycle management practices can 
operate safely at higher stress levels.  Incipient pipeline flaws can occur during pipe 
manufacture or installation.  The technological advances decrease the risk of these flaws 
resulting in pipe failure over time due to the operating pressure.  Furthermore, improved 
life cycle management practices, which include rigorous testing, allow operators to detect 
flaws well before failure.  Because revised regulations allowing increased capacity 
encourage the use of newer pipeline materials and associated safety standards, the result 
should have a net positive effect on overall pipeline safety.   
 
PHMSA’s rulemaking proposal grows out of the agency’s examination of the safety 
issues in allowing existing or proposed pipeline to operate at higher stress levels.  From a 
policy perspective, the experience with last year’s special permits has been very positive.  
One of the successful permitees, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, plans to take advantage 
of the extra capacity a higher stress level will allow to redirect gas supply to the New 
York City metropolitan area, the most capacity-strained market in the nation. 
 
Incorporating the special permit standards into PHMSA’s regulations would allow 
qualified pipelines to operate at higher pressure.  The proposed rule would ease 
regulatory burdens, encourage the development of new infrastructure, improve regulatory 
certainty, and reduce the agency workload associated with granting individual 
applications.   
 
4. RATIONALE FOR REGULATORY ASSESSMENT 
 
Executive Order 12866 directs all Federal agencies to develop both preliminary and final 
regulatory analyses if their proposed regulations are likely to be “significant regulatory 
actions” with an annual impact on the economy of $100 million.  The Order also requires 
a determination as to whether a proposed rule could adversely affect the economy or a 
section of the economy in terms of productivity and employment, the environment, public 
health, safety, or State, local or tribal governments.  In accordance with the regulatory 
philosophy and principles provided in Sections 1(a) and (b) and Section 6(a)(3)(C) of 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
4 
Executive Order 12866, an economic analysis of the proposed regulatory changes must 
be conducted.  Furthermore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended, requires 
Federal agencies to conduct a separate analysis of the economic impact of proposed and 
final rules that have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  In 
addition, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act also requires an impact analysis for rules 
that that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted for inflation) in any 
one year.   
 
In accordance with the above directives, PHMSA has performed a preliminary evaluation 
of the potential compliance costs of the proposed rule and other feasible regulatory 
options, and identified those benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms.  To the 
extent possible, this evaluation is based on the available data and information from a 
range of sources, including PHMSA’s Incident Reporting Database and comments 
received from stakeholders.  PHMSA estimates that the impact of implementing the 
proposed rule will be greater than $100 million annually.  PHMSA does not expect the 
rule to adversely affect the economy or any sector of the economy in terms of 
productivity and employment, the environment, public health, safety, or State, local or 
tribal governments.  PHMSA has also determined, as required by the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities in the United States.  In addition, PHMSA has 
estimated that this proposed rule will not impose annual expenditures of $120.7 million 
or more on State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector, and thus will not 
require an Unfunded Mandates Reform Act analysis.   
 
5. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED  
 
In addition to taking no rulemaking action, PHMSA considered the following two 
alternatives with respect to MAOP:   
 
• Delay rulemaking 
• Undertake rulemaking 
 
Each of these alternatives is evaluated below.   
 
5.1 Take no rulemaking action 
 
PHMSA could continue to address individual special permit applications on a case-by-
case basis.  Although this approach would give PHMSA additional oversight control, it 
would be less efficient for industry and for the agency than promulgating a regulatory 
standard.  For this reason, this was not considered further, but rather will be used as the 
baseline by which to measure the costs and benefits of the other regulatory alternatives. 
 
5.2 Delay rulemaking 
 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
5 
Instead of embarking on the immediate development and implementation of a regulatory 
standard, PHMSA could delay rulemaking and continue to work with consensus 
standard-setting organizations.  Current consensus standards already allow increased 
operating pressures, but without the additional safety requirements PHMSA has imposed 
in special permits.  The standard-setting organization responsible for these standards is 
currently establishing a subcommittee to address operation of pipelines at higher 
pressures.   
 
PHMSA could delay rulemaking in order to gain more experience with evaluating 
applications, and monitoring compliance and outcomes.  Furthermore, the agency could 
wait until the new subcommittee of the standards organization has completed its work.  A 
delay would provide the agency with more confidence in any proposed regulatory 
standard.  Delaying the rulemaking, however, would necessitate continuing the less 
efficient permit process.  Furthermore, promulgating a rulemaking does not preclude 
PHMSA, at some point in the future, from reconsidering or modifying safety 
requirements as a result of the standard setting organization’s further research.  For this 
reason, PHMSA rejected the option to delay the rulemaking, but specifically requests 
comment on the specific safety requirements this rule proposes.     
 
5.3 Undertake rulemaking 
 
The third alternative considered by PHMSA was to undertake a new rulemaking without 
undue delay.  This would minimize the inefficiencies associated with the special permit 
process.  For this reason, the rulemaking alternative was chosen by PHMSA.  PHMSA 
will continue to entertain special permit applications for MAOP increases, to the extent 
permitted by the law, until such permits are determined unnecessary.  The ongoing permit 
process will help inform any rulemaking outcome. 
 
Furthermore, within this option, the agency has explored two options; adopt the current 
consensus standard as written, or adopt a rulemaking that has requirements similar to the 
additional safety requirements PHMSA has imposed in the special permits granted to 
date.  Currently, the proposed rule is the latter of these options.  OMB Circular A-119 
and the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 direct Federal 
agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards in 
their regulatory and procurement activities, except where such standards are inconsistent 
with law or otherwise impractical. Therefore, this impact analysis separately estimates 
the impact of the additional safety requirements that differ from the consensus standard, 
describes why the agency believes this is the best approach, and takes comment on this 
conclusion.   
   
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
PHMSA proposes to revise the Federal pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 192 to 
allow use of an “alternative” MAOP when certain conditions are met.  Under the 
proposed rule, the alternative MAOP for each class location would be as follows: 
 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
6 
• Class 1:  Greater than 72% of SMYS but less than or equal to 80% of SMYS 
• Class 2:  Greater than 60% of SMYS but less than or equal to 67% of SMYS 
• Class 3:  Greater than 50% of SMYS but less than or equal to 56% of SMYS   
• Class 4:  No alternative MAOP is proposed for class 4 locations 
 
The conditions that must be met in order for a segment to be eligible for operation at the 
alternative (higher) MAOP include requirements relating to 
 
• Design 
• Construction 
• O&M 
• Notification 
 
With respect to design, operators must comply with requirements for  
 
• The properties of the steel used for the pipe 
• The manufacturing standards for the pipe 
• Fracture control 
• Plate quality control 
• Seam quality control 
• Mill hydrostatic testing 
• Coating 
• Fittings and flanges 
 
With respect to construction, operators must comply with requirements for  
 
• Quality assurance 
• Girth welds 
• Depth of cover 
• Initial strength testing 
• Cathodic protection 
• Interference currents 
 
With respect to O&M, operators must comply with requirements for  
 
• Responding to emergencies in high consequence areas (HCAs) 
• Monitoring gas quality for internal corrosion control 
• Controlling interference that can impact external corrosion 
• Implementing external corrosion control – cathodic protection 
• Implementing external corrosion control – close interval survey 
• Implementing external corrosion control – annual readings 
• Patrolling the right of way 
• Maintaining the depth of cover 
• Reevaluating the potential impact radius as necessary

• Notifying the public proximate to the pipeline  
• Performing threat assessments 
• Performing indirect assessments 
• Performing baseline and periodic internal inspections 
• Performing additional inspections 
• Performing direct assessments when internal inspection is not possible 
• Evaluating anomalies conservatively and repairing defects expeditiously 
 
With respect to notification, operators must notify PHMSA when they choose to use an 
alternative MAOP.   
 
The proposed rule does not require operators of gas transmission pipelines to make any 
changes.  Rather, the rule provides operators with the option of using an alternative 
(higher) MAOP if their pipelines meet certain specific conditions.  The choice of whether 
to meet those conditions and use an alternative MAOP is left to the operators.   
 
In the remainder of this section, the impacted industry is identified and the affected 
mileage is estimated, and then the benefits and costs of the proposed rule are considered.  
All monetary values, unless otherwise indicated, are given in 2006 constant dollars.16   
 
6.1 Impacted Industry  
 
The proposed rule would cover all existing gas transmission pipelines, of which there are 
approximately 320 thousand miles currently,17 as well as any future gas transmission 
pipelines.   
 
PHMSA expects the MAOP for approximately 3,500 miles of existing pipeline to be 
uprated as a consequence of the proposed rule.  As a practical matter, only a portion of 
the existing gas transmission pipeline mileage would be a candidate for a higher 
alternative MAOP due to the requirements associated with increasing the MAOP.  Many 
pipeline operators are expected to find the cost of using the alternative MAOP to be too 
high.  For instance, fitting and pressure vessel replacement costs may prevent some 
pipelines from converting to a higher MAOP.  Additionally, the costs associated with 
converting non-piggable lines are expected to be prohibitive.  Also, PHMSA expects that 
only post-1980 pipelines will be appropriate for converting to a higher MAOP.     
 
PHMSA expects approximately 700 miles of new gas transmission pipeline certificated 
each year to take advantage of the proposed regulation and be operated at an alternative 
                                                 
16 To convert nominal dollars into 2006 constant dollars, the implicit price deflator for Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP), transformed from 2000=100 to 2006=100, was used (for the implicit price deflators, 
2000=100, see Table 1.1.9, Implicit Price Deflators for Gross Domestic Product, Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, National Income Accounts).  The 2006 deflator (2000=100) was calculated by averaging the 
quarterly implicit price deflators for the first and second quarters of 2006.  After the drafting of this 
analysis, GDP implicit price deflators have been updated for all of 2006; however, this update had no 
material impact on the results of the analysis.   
17 See PHMSA, Distribution & Transmission Annual Mileage Totals (1984-2005),

MAOP.  This includes pipeline mileage in class 1, class 2, and class 3 locations.  PHMSA 
expects that many operators will only select an alternative MAOP for their new pipelines 
in class 1 locations.   
 
For this analysis, PHSMA expects that, in the first year after implementation of the 
proposed rule, 4,200 miles of pipeline would begin to be operated at an alternative 
MAOP.  This consists of 3,500 miles of existing pipeline and 700 miles of new pipeline.  
Furthermore, PHMSA expects that in each subsequent year and additional 700 miles of 
new pipeline would begin to be operated at an alternative MAOP. 
 
6.2 Benefits 
 
The main expected benefits of the proposed rule would be the following: 
 
• A reduction of the consequences (e.g., deaths, injuries, property damage, and lost 
gas) resulting from pipeline incidents 
• Fuel cost savings 
• A reduction in pipeline capital expenditures 
• An increase in pipeline capacity 
• An increase in line-pack  
• A reduction in adverse environmental impacts  
 
These benefits are discussed below.  Following the discussion of each individual benefit, 
the total benefits and their present value are estimated.  The benefits discussion concludes 
with a review of benefits uncertainties. 
 
6.2.1 Reduced Incident Consequences from Pipeline Incidents 
 
The operation of natural gas transmission pipelines at higher MAOP is not expected to 
increase the number or severity of pipeline incidents.18  The proposed rule’s 
requirements, such as right of way patrolling, additional internal inspections, and 
anomaly repair, are expected to prevent incidents that would have occurred in the absence 
of the proposed rule, and to help mitigate the consequences of the incidents that do occur.   
 
A quantitative estimate of the benefits associated with reduced incident consequences is 
not developed for this analysis.  While PHMSA expects the proposed rule to reduce the 
incidents and incident consequences on the pipeline mileage affected by the rule, 
quantification of the benefits resulting from those reductions would be difficult.  For 
instance, differentiating the benefits attributable to increased right-of-way patrolling from 
those attributable to other regulatory safety requirements relating to the prevention or 
mitigation of excavation or natural forces damage would be very hard.  As another 
example, differentiating the benefits attributable to additional internal pipeline 
                                                 
18 See, for instance, Joy O. Kadnar, PHMSA, “Reconsideration of Maximum Allowable Operating 
Pressures for Natural Gas Pipelines,” PHMSA-2005-23447-46; Alan Eastman, Mears Group, Inc., “Impact 
of 80% SMYS Operation on Time Dependent Threats,” PHMSA-2005-23447-28.

9 
inspections from those attributable to other regulatory safety requirements relating to 
corrosion damage prevention and control would also be very hard.   
 
Additionally, PHMSA expects that many pipeline operators have already adopted the 
practices required by the proposed rule.  As a consequence, the estimated benefits 
associated with the safety improvements attributable to the proposed rule would likely be 
relatively small.   
 
6.2.2 Fuel Cost Savings 
 
Natural gas engines or turbines are frequently used to drive the compressors that move 
the product through gas transmission pipelines.  Industry expects the proposed rule to 
reduce fuel costs for pipelines using an alternative MAOP.   
 
In a submission to PHMSA relating to its petition to increase the MAOP on 874.7 miles 
of pipeline in the U.S. from 72% of SMYS to 80% of SYMS, Alliance Pipeline estimated 
that it could save $11.9 million on its fuel costs in 2007 with the higher MAOP.  In 
calculating this estimate, gas was assumed to cost $5.72 per million BTUs.19   
 
For this analysis, PHMSA assumes that the annual fuel cost savings realized by operators 
of pipelines choosing to go with an alternative MAOP would be $14,000 per mile (≈ 
$11.9 million / 874.7 miles).  This estimate is based on the fuel cost savings information 
provided by Alliance Pipeline.   
 
For this analysis, PHMSA assumes that only existing pipelines choosing to go with an 
alternative MAOP would realize fuel cost savings. PHMSA assumes that new pipelines 
would have a choice of fuel cost savings or reduced capital expenditures, but not both, 
and would choose reduced capital expenditures.  PHMSA requests comment on these 
assumptions. 
 
Assuming that 3,500 miles of existing pipeline are initially affected in the first year, the 
total cost savings in that year would be $49,000,000 (= $14,000 x 3,500 miles).  It should 
be noted that all fuel savings are annually recurring.  That is, they will continue to be 
realized each and every year after an existing pipeline begins using an alternative MAOP. 
 
 
 
6.2.3 Reduced Capital Expenditures 
 
Using an alternative MAOP is expected by industry to reduce capital expenditures for 
new pipelines.20  The reduced capital expenditures we can quantify would come primarily 
                                                 
19 Submission by Alliance Pipeline, L.P., to PHMSA, Feb. 20, 2006, PHMSA-2005-23387-8.  With 
increasing gas prices, the fuel cost savings could be substantially higher.  
20 See, for example, the response by BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp. to dockets PHMSA-2005-23387, 
PHMSA-2005-23447, and PHMSA-2005-23448 or Howard J. Murphy, Jr., Energy Experts International, 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
10 
from a reduction in the required amount of steel for pipe.  To determine the wall 
thickness of pipe (t) needed for a specific operating pressure (P), an operator would use 
the design formula specified in § 192.105 and solve for t as follows: 
 
t = (P x D) / (2 x S x F)21. 
 
The increase in the design factor F proposed in this rulemaking results in a decreased 
value for t.  The use of thinner walled pipe results in a savings in the amount of steel 
needed.   
 
Information on the total capital expenditure savings attributable to the use of an 
alternative MAOP by new pipelines is not readily available.  Neither is information on 
the capital expenditure savings attributable to the expected reduction in the required 
investment in compressors.  PHMSA has developed an estimate for the capital 
expenditure savings attributable to the expected reduction in the required investment in 
pipe, which is based on information obtained by PHMSA from materials submitted in 
support of special permits for five pipeline projects.  That information is presented in 
Table 1.  PHMSA’s estimate of the expected reduction in the required investment in pipe 
is $78,000 per mile (≈ ($1,644,426,018.22 - $1,482,036,468.80) / 2,075 miles).  The 
estimate assumes that the cost of steel for pipe is $1,300 per ton.

Assuming that 700 miles of new pipeline are initially affected by the proposed rule in the 
first year and that 700 miles of new pipeline are added each year thereafter, the expected 
annual capital expenditure savings attributable to the reduction in pipe investment would 
be approximately $54.6 million (= $78,000 per mile x 700 miles).  As indicated above, 
this estimate does not include any capital expenditure savings attributable to compressor 
investment, a savings that could be substantial.22

6.2.4 Increased Pipeline Capacity 
 
In the case of new pipelines, the ability to use an alternative MAOP will make it possible 
to transport more product.  Quantifying the value of this increased capacity is difficult, 
and no estimate has been developed for this analysis.  Nonetheless, PHMSA expects the 
value of increased capacity due to use of alternative MAOP by gas pipelines to be 
significant. Estimates made with respect to the proposed trans-Alaskan gas pipeline 
include an estimated increase of 14.2 million standard cubic feet of gas per day 23  In 
areas where production is already well-established, there is an even greater potential for 
increased pipeline capacity. For example, one recipient of a special permit estimated a 
daily increase of at least 62 million standard cubic feet of gas 24  In addition to simply 
being better able to meet demand, increased capacity will eventually mean cost savings 
with the elimination of the need for some future pipelines (i.e., the capacity added by 
using an alternative MAOP may eliminate the need to construct a new pipeline with that 
capacity at some later date).  PHSMA specifically requests comment and estimates of the 
potentially large benefits of increased pipeline capacity. 
 
6.2.5 Increased Line Pack 
 
Line pack is essentially the quantity of natural gas filling a pipeline or pipeline segment 
and the amount of line pack varies by the pressure in the pipeline.  On pipelines using an 
alternative MAOP, the line pack would be greater than it would be if an alternative 
MAOP were not used.  Line pack may be either owned by the pipeline operator or 
provided by its customers.   
 
Increased line pack has several advantages.  First, it reduces the amount of external 
storage that is needed for natural gas.  The reduction in the amount of external storage 
needed may result in capital or O&M cost savings for pipelines or their customers.  
Currently in the U.S., an estimated 95% to 98% of external natural gas storage is 
underground in depleted oil or gas reservoirs that have been retrofitted to handle gas 
injection and withdrawal.25  Added storage via increased line pack could be particularly 
important in areas where underground storage is limited, such as in the southwest.26 
 
Second, increased line pack allows more product to be delivered to customers when 
segments of a pipeline must be (1) taken out of service for routine maintenance or (2) 
shut down due to pipeline accidents or problems with pipeline valves, compressors, or 
other equipment.

Third, increased line pack allows pipelines greater latitude in covering peaks in natural 
gas demand.  This would be of value serving certain natural gas consumers, such as 
electric utilities, “…with load profiles that are not uniform.” 27   
 
The value of these and any other benefits attributable to increased line pack cannot be 
readily quantified, but may be substantial.  PHSMA specifically requests comment and 
estimates of the potential benefits of increased line pack. 
 
6.2.6 Reduced Adverse Environmental Impacts 
 
Allowing pipelines to use an alternative MAOP would have environmental benefits.  
Because of the potential for increased capacity by pipelines using an alternative MAOP, 
fewer pipelines might be needed.  In addition to the potentially large economic benefits 
of increased capacity discussed above, this means that, all other things equal, less local 
ecology would be disturbed by the construction of new pipelines, and fewer 
environmentally sensitive areas would be disturbed by operation and maintenance 
activities such as pipeline repairs.  In addition, the new requirements are expected to 
reduce the likelihood of leaks, and thereby reduce the potential harm that natural gas 
escaping from those leaks could have on the atmosphere.  The value of the environmental 
benefits resulting from the use of an alternative MAOP cannot be readily quantified.  It 
may be substantial, however.    
 
6.2.7 Other Expected Benefits 
 
PHMSA notes that a number of additional benefits would result from the proposed rule.  
Those benefits include the reduction of certain costs, other than steel costs, associated 
with the construction of new pipelines (e.g., pipe transport, compressor, and welding 
costs).  Although not quantified in this report, these additional benefits are expected to be 
quite substantial.   
 
6.2.8 Total Benefits  
 
Table 2 and presents a summary of the estimated benefits of the proposed rule..  As a 
consequence of the proposed rule, PHMSA estimates that pipeline operators will realize 
annually recurring benefits of $49.0 million that begin in the initial year after the rule 
goes into effect.  Additionally, PHMSA estimates that each year pipeline operators will 
realize one-time benefits of $54.6 million (since 700 miles of new pipeline operating at 
an alternative MAOP are added each year, the one-time benefits resulting from this added 
mileage will be the same each year)  In total, operators will realize $103.6 million (= 
$49.0 million + $54.6 million) in benefits per year.  These estimates only include the 
benefits attributable to (1) fuel savings and (2) reduced capital expenditures related to 
pipe on new pipelines.  They do not include any benefits attributable to (1) reduced 
incident consequences, (2) reduced capital expenditures related to compressors on new 
pipelines, (3) increased pipeline capacity, (4) increased line pack, (5) less environmental 
disturbance, or (6) other improvements, since those benefits were not quantified in this

analysis.  PHMSA believes these additional benefits could add millions, and potentially 
hundreds of millions, to the total benefits from the proposed rule, and specifically asks 
comment regarding these additional benefits.

6.2.8 Benefit Uncertainties 
 
The benefit estimates developed for this proposed rule are built on several key 
assumptions:    
 
• Pipeline operators using an alternative MAOP will experience annual fuel cost 
savings of $14,000 per mile.  This estimate depends critically on the gas price. 
• 4,200 miles of pipeline will adopt an alternative MAOP in the first year after 
implementation of the proposed rule and an additional 700 miles of pipeline will 
begin to use an alternative MAOP in each succeeding year.   
• Pipeline operators with new pipelines using an alternative MAOP will experience 
a capital expenditure cost savings attributable to pipe of $78,000 per mile.    
 
These assumptions introduce uncertainties into the benefits calculations.  The impacts of 
these uncertainties on the benefits estimates are discussed below. 
 
Impact of Fuel Cost Savings Per Mile 
 
The fuel saving per mile when an alternative MAOP is used may be lower than the 
$14,000 used in this analysis, or it may be higher.  Table 4 presents the benefits that 
would result if the fuel savings per mile were decreased or increased by 50% (i.e., 
decreased to $7,000 per mile or increased to $21,000 per mile).

7% and 20 years $838 $1,357 
 
 
When the fuel cost savings are increased by 50%, the present value of the benefits 
increases to 124% of the present value of the benefits under the base case.  When the fuel 
cost savings are decreased by 50%, the present value of the benefits decreases to 76% of 
the present value of the base case.  Thus, a 50% change in the fuel cost savings generates 
a 24% change in the present value of the benefits.

17 
Impact of Pipeline Mileages with an Alternative MAOP 
 
The actual pipeline mileages with which an alternative MAOP is used may be lower than 
those used in this analysis, or they may be higher.  Table 5 presents the benefits that 
would result if the pipeline mileages were decreased or increased by 50%.

Number of Years 
Present Value Present Value 
3% and 20 years $771 $2,312 
7% and 20 years $549 $1,646 
 
 
When the mileage is reduced to 2,100 miles in the first year with 350 miles in each 
subsequent year (i.e., by 50%), the present values are half of what was estimated using 
the 4,200 and 700 mileage values.  When the mileage is increased to 6,300 miles in the 
first year with 1,150 miles in each subsequent year (i.e., by 50%), the present values also 
increase by 50%.   
 
It is possible that the addition of new pipeline that would actually use an alternative 
MAOP might occur for a few years, rather than for 20 years following implementation of 
the proposed rule.  PHMSA estimates that approximately 3,500 miles of new gas 
transmission pipeline certificated in the next 5 years would be operated at an alternative 
MAOP.  Table 6 presents the benefits that would result if only those 3,500 miles of new 
pipeline were to use an alternative MAOP.

7% and 20 years $743
 
 
This change reduces the present value of the benefits to 64% or 68% of what it is under 
the base case.  While this change would result in a reduction in the present value of the 
benefits of hundreds of millions of dollars, the resulting present values are still approach  
$1 billion.   
 
Impact of Capital Expenditure Savings on Pipe for New Pipelines 
 
The capital expenditure savings on pipe for new pipelines when an alternative MAOP is 
used may be lower than the $78,000 per mile used in this analysis, or it may be higher 
(especially since PHMSA did not include possible savings due to other capital 
expenditures besides steel cost).  Table 7 presents the benefits that would result if the fuel 
savings per mile were decreased or increased by 50% (i.e., decreased to $39,000 per mile 
or increased to $117,000 per mile).

When the capital expenditure savings are increased by 50%, the present value of the 
benefits increases to 126% of the present value of the benefits under the base case.  When 
the capital expenditure savings are decreased by 50%, the present value of the benefits 
decreases to 74% of the present value of the base case.  Thus, a 50% change in the capital 
expenditure savings generates a 26% change in the present value of the benefits.   
 
6.3 Costs 
 
The proposed rule does not require operators of natural gas transmission systems to use 
an alternative MAOP on their pipeline.  Rather, it provides operators with pipeline in 
class 1, class 2, or class 3 locations the option of using an alternative MAOP under 
certain circumstances.  The proposed rule will cost operators only if they choose to use an 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
19 
alternative MAOP on their pipeline; however, the benefits summarized above will only 
be realized under the assumption that these voluntary costs are also incurred.   
 
For the most part, the proposed rule merely codifies existing best practices with respect to 
pipeline design, construction, and O&M.  In many cases, pipeline operators have already 
adopted these best practices as part of their standard operating procedures; therefore, the 
costs associated with these practices already taking place are incorporated into the 
baseline of this analysis.   
 
PHMSA expects costs attributable to the proposed rule are most likely to be incurred by 
operators for: 
 
• Performing baseline internal inspections 
• Performing additional internal inspections 
• Performing anomaly repairs 
• Installing remotely controlled valves on either side of high consequence areas 
(HCAs) 
• Preparing threat assessments 
• Patrolling pipeline rights-of-way  
• Notifying PHMSA  
 
These costs are discussed below.  Following the discussion of each individual cost, total 
costs and the present value of those total costs are calculated.  The uncertainties relating 
to the cost estimates are then discussed. 
 
6.3.1 Performing Baseline Internal Inspections 
 
The proposed rule requires the operators of new pipelines electing to use an alternative 
MAOP to do a baseline internal assessment.  The assessment must use a high-resolution 
magnetic flux tool and be conducted within 3 years of placing the pipeline in service.  In 
addition, the assessment requires the use of a geometry tool after the initial hydrostatic 
test and backfill, but no later than 6 months after placing the pipeline in service.  The 
operators of existing lines electing to use an alternative MAOP must do a baseline 
assessment using the same tools within two years of raising the MAOP.   
 
PHMSA expects operators to perform the required tests on new pipelines even without 
the proposed rule.  Thus, new pipelines would incur no additional costs attributable to the 
baseline internal inspection requirement of the proposed rule.  Existing pipelines that are 
uprated will need the two tests and, in the absence of the proposed rule, those tests would 
not ordinarily be performed.   
 
Both of the tests on the existing pipeline mileage will be accomplished through the use of 
smart pigs.  INGAA has previously estimated that the cost of smart pigging transmission 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
20 
pipelines is $3,669 per mile (in 2001 dollars).28  This is $4,160 per mile when converted 
to 2006 dollars. 
 
To simplify computation, both tests are assumed to be completed in the first year after the 
proposed rule is implemented.29  The total cost of the tests would be approximately $29.1 
million (= 3,500 miles of pipeline x $4,160 per mile x 2).  This cost would be incurred 
only once. 
 
6.3.2 Performing Additional Internal Inspections 
 
The proposed rule requires periodic internal inspections using a high resolution magnetic 
flux tool on a frequency determined as if the segments were covered by 49 CFR 192 
subpart O (“Gas Transmission Pipeline Integrity Management”).  After baseline internal 
inspection has been completed, operators will need to use a smart pig (or equivalent) on 
their lines at least once every 10 years.   
 
PHMSA estimates that the cost of smart pigging a pipeline is $4,160 per mile (see 
Section 6.3.1).  Furthermore, PHMSA expects that this requirement would impact 4,200 
miles of pipeline in the eleventh year after implementation of the proposed rule and 700 
miles of pipeline each year thereafter.30  In the eleventh year, pipeline operators would 
incur $17.5 million (= 4,200 miles x $4,160 per mile) in costs attributable to this 
requirement, while in years 12 through 20 they would incur $2.9 million (= 700 miles x 
$4,160 per mile) per year attributable to the requirement.   
 
6.3.3 Performing Anomaly Repairs 
 
The proposed rule requires that certain anomalies be repaired immediately, when 
identified, and certain others be repaired within one year of their discovery.   
 
Given the requirements of 49 CFR 192.309, PHMSA does not expect that the repair 
requirements of the proposed rule will cause any newly laid pipelines to incur additional 
costs.  Only existing pipelines are expected to incur additional costs attributable to the 
repair requirement.  Furthermore, PHMSA expects the needed repairs to be identified 
primarily through internal inspections.   
 
PHSMA does not have estimates of the immediate and one-year repair rates for 
transmission pipelines operating at a higher stress level.  PHMSA does have immediate 
and one-year repair rates for transmission pipelines in HCAs, however.  Those rates, 
derived from gas integrity management program performance metric submissions as of 
December 2006, are 0.03 immediate repairs per mile inspected and 0.08 one-year repairs 
                                                 
28 Final Regulatory Evaluation, Pipeline Integrity Management in High Consequence Areas (Gas 
Transmission Pipelines, p. 43, PHMSA-RSPA-2000-7666-356.   
29 This will increase the present value of the costs slightly, since the present value of $1 in the first year is 
greater than the present value of $1 in the second or third years. 
30 The cycle would begin over in the 21st year, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
21 
per mile inspected.  Overall, the sum of immediate and one-year repair rates is 0.11 
repairs per mile (= 0.03 immediate repairs per mile + 0.08 one-year repairs per mile).   
 
PHMSA notes that these rates are for older pipelines, most not designed and constructed, 
or operated and maintained, to the rigorous standards required under the proposed rule.  
Furthermore, since inspections are prioritized based on risk, these estimates should be for 
the riskier pipeline segments within HCAs.  Consequently, PHMSA expects that the rates 
for pipelines operating at higher stress levels would be significantly lower than 0.11 
repairs per mile.  For this analysis, PHMSA assumes that the immediate and one-year 
repairs will be 10% of the 0.11 repairs per mile, or 0.01 repairs per mile for gas 
transmission pipelines using an alternative MAOP.  For ease of computation, it is 
assumed that all anomalies are discovered and repaired within the same year.   
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the total cost of repairing a 
6-inch non-leaking defect by replacing the pipe in a 24-inch steel pipeline operated at 350 
pounds per square inch gage (psig) with 10 miles between shutoff valves would be 
$22,746 (based on the publication date, this estimate is presumed to be expressed in 2003 
dollars).  This estimate includes the costs associated with (1) lost methane, (2) purge gas, 
(3) labor, (4) equipment and material, and (5) indirect costs.31   
 
Duke Energy Gas Transmission and INGAA have estimated that the total cost of 
repairing a 6-inch non-leaking defect by replacing 6 feet of pipe in a 24-inch steel 
pipeline operated at 350 psig with 10 miles between block valves would be $15,300 
(based on the publication date, this estimate is presumed to be expressed in 2004 dollars).  
This estimate includes the costs associated with (1) purge gas, (2) labor, (3) equipment 
and material, and (4) other.  It does not include the value of lost methane, which was 
estimated to be $11,900 (presumably in 2004 dollars).32   
 
For this analysis, the cost of repairing a steel pipeline is assumed to be $29,000.  This is 
based on the estimates for replacing the steel piping by Duke and INGAA, including the 
value of lost gas.  While using a composite wrap would cost significantly less (i.e., 
roughly 20% of the cost of replacing the steel pipe when the cost of lost gas is included), 
its appropriateness for use on pipelines operating at an alternative MAOP is unknown.   
 
In total, the cost per mile of repairing defects is estimated to be $290 per mile (= 0.01 per 
mile x $29,000).  Repairs will be undertaken after internal inspection.  A total of 3,500 
miles of existing pipeline will be internally inspected in the first year after 
implementation of the proposed rule (see Section 6.3.1).  After this inspection, pipeline 
operators will incur repair costs of $1.0 million (= 3,500 miles x $290 per mile).  In the 
eleventh year after implementation a total of 4,200 miles of pipeline will be internally 
inspected (see Section 6.3.2).  After this inspection, pipeline operators will incur repair

costs of $1.2 million (= 4,200 miles x $290 per mile).  In each subsequent year, a total of 
700 miles of pipeline will be internally inspected (see Section 6.3.2).  After each of these 
inspections, pipeline operators will incur repair costs of $203,000 (= 700 miles x $290 
per mile).   
 
6.3.4 Installing Remotely Controlled Valves at HCAs 
 
The proposed rule requires that mainline valves on either side of an HCA be remotely 
controlled via a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, or other 
alternative method, if personnel response time to the valves exceeds one hour.  The 
valves covered by this requirement are not necessarily at the boundary of each HCA, but 
rather are the closest valves to the HCA on the pipeline.  PHMSA notes that many 
operators currently choose to automate these valves.   
 
PHSMA expects that the proposed rule will result in the installation of 12 additional 
remotely controlled mainline valves per thousand miles of pipeline.  PHMSA estimates 
that the cost for these valves for a 42-inch gas transmission pipeline would be 
approximately $70,000.   
 
For this analysis, PHMSA assumes that the cost of remotely controlled valves would be 
$70,000.  This probably overstates the cost, since valves for pipelines with smaller 
diameters would cost less than those used with a 42-inch pipeline.   
 
The cost of the requirement to install remotely controlled valves at HCAs when the 
response time for personnel exceeds one hour will be $840,000 per thousand miles of 
pipeline (= 12 remotely controlled valves x $70,000 per valve).  Assuming that an 
alternative MAOP would be adopted for 4,200 miles of pipeline in the first year after the 
proposed rule is implemented, the total cost of the requirement in the first year would be 
$3.5 million (= 4,200 miles x $840,000 per thousand miles).  The total cost in each 
subsequent year would be $588,000 (= 700 miles x $840,000 per thousand miles).  These 
would be one-time costs.   
 
For new pipelines, these estimates probably overstate actual costs, since pipeline 
operators would likely be purchasing remotely controlled valves in place of valves that 
are not remotely controlled.  For all pipelines, the estimated cost, $70,000 per valve, 
probably overstates the average cost of the remotely controlled valves that operators 
would purchase.  Consequently, the estimates developed here probably overstate the 
actual costs of the requirement.   
 
6.3.5 Preparing Threat Assessments 
 
The proposed rule requires operators electing to use an alternative MAOP to develop a 
threat matrix identifying and comparing the increased changes in risk of operating their 
pipelines at the increased stress level.  Additionally, operators must describe the 
procedures they will take to mitigate the risk.   
 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
23 
Kinder Morgan has been involved in the preparation of threat assessments for three 
pipelines seeking approval to use the alternative method to establish MAOP:  (1) Rockies 
Express, (2) Kinder Morgan Louisiana, and (3) Midcontinent Express.  Those threat 
assessments are reported to have cost $16,000, $7,000, and $8,000, respectively.  The 
costs are made up entirely of labor charges.  The analytical tool used for the threat 
assessments had been previously acquired to perform the threat assessments needed for 
gas transmission pipeline Integrity Management.  The data used for the threat 
assessments had been acquired to support Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
permitting requirements for the pipelines.33 
 
Based on this information, PHMSA estimates that each threat assessment required for the 
proposed rule will cost $10 thousand.34   
 
The number of pipelines needing to prepare threat assessments is unknown and must be 
estimated.   
 
In 2006, PHMSA received 1393 reports covering 320,532 miles of gas transmission and 
gathering system pipeline.  On average, each report covered approximately 230 miles of 
pipeline (= 320,532 miles / 1393 reports).   
 
Assuming that each report covered, on average, one pipeline, PHMSA expects the 4,200 
miles of pipeline adopting an alternative MAOP in the first year if the proposed rule is 
implemented to consist of 18 pipelines (= 4,200 miles / 230 miles per pipeline).  The 700 
miles of additional pipeline that is expected to adopt an alternative MAOP in subsequent 
years is estimated to consist of 3 pipelines (= 700 miles / 230 miles per pipeline).   
 
Based on the foregoing, the costs resulting from preparing threat assessments are 
expected to be $180,000 in the first year if the proposed rule is implemented (= $10,000 x 
18) and $30,000 in each subsequent year (= $10,000 x 3).  For this analysis, this is treated 
as a one-time cost.  In reality, updates would be required if and when changes in risk 
occurred.  These updates would not be expected to cost as much as the original threat 
assessments.   
 
6.3.6 Patrolling Rights-of-Way 
 
The proposed rule requires patrolling of the rights-of-way for pipelines using an 
alternative MAOP.  Patrols must be no further than three weeks apart.  The purpose of the 
patrols is to inspect for excavation activities, ground movement, wash outs, leakage, or 
other activities or conditions affecting pipeline integrity.   
 
Currently, under Section 192.705, gas transmission lines must be patrolled periodically.  
At highway and railroad crossings, pipelines in class 1, 2, and 3 locations must be 
patrolled at least 4 times per year.  At all other places, pipelines in class 1 and 2 locations 
                                                 
33 Communication between M. Dwayne Burton, KinderMorgan, and Paul Zebe, Volpe Center, August 3, 
2007. 
34 $10,000 ≈ ($16,000 + $7,000 + $8,000)/3. 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
24 
must be patrolled at least 1 time per year, while pipelines in class 3 locations must be 
patrolled at least 2 times per year. 
 
PHMSA estimates that it costs $25,000 to patrol 250 miles of pipeline (i.e., $100 per 
pipeline mile).  This cost estimate includes the fully loaded cost of one person plus the 
cost of ground transport along the pipeline.   
 
For this analysis, PHMSA assumes that the new patrolling requirement would add 24 
additional patrols per pipeline mile per year.   PHMSA assumes that currently 2 patrols 
occur on average during a year, and that under the proposed rule a total of 26 patrols 
would be needed (i.e., one every two weeks).  The cost of the 24 added patrols would be 
$2,400 per pipeline mile per year (= 24 patrols per year x $100 per pipeline mile).  If the 
proposed rule were to be implemented, in the first year 4,200 miles of pipeline would 
need to be patrolled.  The total added cost of patrolling 4,200 miles would be $10.1 
million per year (= $2,400 per mile per year x 4,200 miles).  In subsequent years, an 
additional $1.7 million would be added annually (= $2,400 per mile per year x 700 miles) 
to the patrolling cost of the previous year.  Table 8 presents the estimated patrolling costs 
for the first 20 years after implementation of the proposed rule.

6.3.7 Notifying PHMSA of the Decision to Use an Alternative MAOP 
 
Operators electing to implement an alternative MAOP on any eligible segments of their 
pipeline must notify PHMSA of that decision at least 30 days before implementing it.  A 
senior executive officer of the pipeline company must sign the certification.  
Additionally, records documenting that the segment is in a class 1, 2, or 3 location and 
meets the design, construction, and O&M requirements of the proposed rule must be 
maintained for the useful life of the pipeline segment.  The costs of the preparation and 
transmittal of the notification and the maintenance of the required records are expected to 
be nominal.  In fact, PHMSA expects that operators would keep the required records even 
in the absence of the requirement to do so included in the proposed rule.   
 
6.3.8 Total Costs 
 
Tables 9 and 10 present summaries of the estimated costs of the proposed rule over 20 
years, along with the calculated totals for those costs by year.  In total, the costs of the 
proposed rule are expected to be $43.9 million in the first year, go from $12.4 million in 
the second year to $25.8 million in the tenth year, be $46.2 million in the eleventh year, 
and then go from $32.3 million in the twelfth year to $45.7 million in the twentieth year.

PHSMA expects that the estimates in Table 10 overstate the true costs of the proposed 
rule.  The cost of remotely controlled mainline valves overstates the additional cost that 
would be experienced by pipeline operators meeting the requirements of the proposed 
rule.   
 
The present and annualized values of the estimated costs over 20 years using 3% and 7% 
discount rates are given in Table 11.

27 
The cost estimates developed for this proposed rule are built on a number of key 
assumptions:    
 
• 4,200 miles of pipeline will begin to use an alternative MAOP in the first year 
after implementation of the proposed rule and an additional 700 miles of pipeline 
will begin to use an alternative MAOP in each succeeding year.   
• Smart pigging will cost $4,160 per mile. 
• 0.01 repairs per mile will need to be made. 
• The cost of repairing a pipeline anomaly will be $29,000. 
• The remotely controlled valves will each cost $70,000. 
• 12 additional remotely controlled valves will be needed per thousand miles of 
pipeline. 
• Threat assessments cost $10,000 to prepare. 
• 18 threat assessments will need to be prepared in the first year and 3 will need to 
be prepared in each year thereafter. 
• No updates to the threat assessments will be prepared. 
• Patrolling rights-of-way will cost $100 per pipeline mile. 
• 24 additional pipeline patrols will be needed annually 
• The cost of notification will be nominal. 
 
These assumptions introduce uncertainties into the cost calculations.  The impacts of 
these uncertainties on the costs of the proposed rule are discussed below.   
 
Impact of Mileage Estimates 
 
The most important of the assumptions underlying the cost estimates are those relating to 
the mileage that is expected to begin using an alternative MAOP.  The mileage estimates 
– 4,200 miles the first year and 700 miles each year thereafter – are used in the derivation 
of every cost estimate, with the exception of notification.  The actual pipeline mileages 
adopting an alternative MAOP may vary from these estimates.  Table 12 presents the 
costs that would result if the pipeline mileages were changed by plus or minus 50%.  
Table 13 gives the present values of the costs if the pipeline mileages were changed by 
plus or minus 50%.

When the mileage is reduced to 2,100 miles in the first year with 350 miles added in each 
subsequent year (i.e., by 50%), the annual total costs and the present values are 
essentially half of what was estimated using the 4,200 and 700 mileage values of the base 
case.  When the mileage is increased to 6,300 miles in the first year with 1,150 miles in 
each subsequent year (i.e., by 50%), the annual total costs and the present values also 
increase by approximately 50%.   
 
Adding 700 miles per year for 20 years may overstate the new pipeline mileage that 
would actually use an alternative MAOP.  The addition of new pipeline might occur only 
over a shorter period, rather than every year for the 20 years following implementation of 
the proposed rule.  PHMSA estimates that approximately 3,500 miles of new gas 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
29 
transmission pipeline certificated in the next 5 years would be operated at an alternative 
MAOP.  Tables 14 and 15 display the annual total costs and present values that would 
result if only those 3,500 miles of new pipeline (with 700 miles added in each of the 5 
years) were to use an alternative MAOP.

Adding 700 miles per year of new pipeline only during the first 5 years after 
implementation of the proposed rule has a fairly dramatic impact on costs.  The present 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
30 
value of the total costs is approximately 33% less than the base case estimate at the 3% 
discount rate.  This is a significant change.   
 
Impact of the Cost of Smart Pigging 
 
The cost of smart pigging, $4,160 per mile, is based on an estimate previously provided 
PHMSA by INGAA, an industry group representing interstate natural gas pipeline 
operators.  Since INGAA should have a fairly good understanding of the costs of smart 
pigging for natural gas pipelines, and since the estimate was provided to PHMSA 
relatively recently, the uncertainties associated with the estimate are expected to be 
minor.  The impacts of those uncertainties on the total costs of the proposed rule are 
expected to be minimal.   
 
Impact of Anomaly Repairs Per Mile 
 
The base case assumes that 0.01 anomaly repairs per pipeline mile will be needed.  This 
value is based on PHMSA’s expectation that more stringent requirements concerning 
design, construction, and O&M will result in fewer anomaly repairs.  Information on 
natural gas transmission pipelines indicates that they are experiencing 0.11 repairs per 
mile that need to be repaired immediately or within one year of discovery.  This is a 
reasonable upper limit on the number of anomaly repairs that could be expected.  
PHMSA has hopes that the stringent requirements included in the proposed rule could 
drive the repair rate down to where the rate per mile is approximately 0.00.  This would a 
reasonable lower limit on the number of anomaly repairs that could be expected.  Tables 
16 and 17 present the total cost and present values when the anomaly repair rates are 0.11 
per mile or 0.00 per mile.

With an anomaly repair rate of 0.11 per mile, the present value of costs increases by 
approximately 5% at the 3% discount rate.  With an anomaly repair rate of 0.00, the 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
32 
present value of costs decreases by approximately 1% at the 3% discount rate.  The 
impact of changing the repair rate on costs would appear to be relatively small.   
 
Impact of Cost of Anomaly Repairs 
 
The base case assumes that the cost of repairing anomalies on gas transmission lines will 
be $29,000 per anomaly.  Although this value is based on information obtained from 
Duke and INGAA, the actual average cost of repairing anomalies could be higher or 
lower than this value.  In part, the value will depend on the value of the gas lost during 
repair.  In the Duke/INGAA estimate, the value of the lost gas comprised over 40% of the 
total cost of the repair.  Tables 18 and 19 present the total costs and present values when

Comparing the results in Tables 18 and 19 with those in Tables 10 and 11, it is evident 
that the cost of anomaly repairs has a minimal impact on total costs.  The present value of 
costs changes less than 1% at the 3% discount rate.   
 
Impact of Valve Cost  
 
For the base case costs, remotely controlled valves are assumed to cost $70 thousand 
each.  The actual cost of valves may be higher or lower than this.  Tables 20 and 21 
present the total costs and present values when valve costs are increased or decreased by 
50%.

Changing the valve cost by 50% changes the present value of the total costs by 
approximately 1% to 2% at the 3% discount rate.  The impact of changing the valve cost, 
therefore, would be relatively minor.   
 
Impact of Number of Valves Installed 
 
The base case assumes that 12 additional remotely controlled valves will be needed per 
thousand miles of pipeline.  The impact of increasing the assumed number of valves 
installed per mile by 50% will be identical to the impact of increasing the cost of the 
valves by 50%.  The impact of decreasing the assumed number of valves installed by 
50% will be identical to the impact of decreasing the cost of the valves by 50%.  The total 
cost and present value when the cost of the valves is increased or decreased by 50% are 
presented in Tables 20 and 21.  Based on the results presented in those tables, the impact 
of changing the number of valves installed is expected to be relatively minor. 
 
Impact of Cost of Threat Assessments 
 
The base case assumes that threat assessments cost $10,000 to prepare.  Tables 22 and 23

threat assessment is increased or decreased by 50%.

36 
Changing the threat assessment costs by plus or minus 50% changes the present value of 
the total costs by less than 0.5% at the 3% discount rate.  Therefore, the impact of 
changing the threat assessment cost is relatively minor.   
 
Impact of Number of Threat Assessments 
 
In the base case, it is estimated that 18 threat assessments would be needed in the first 
year after implementation of the proposed rule and 3 in every year thereafter.  The actual 
number of threat assessments may be higher or lower than these estimates.  The impact of 
increasing the assumed number of threat assessments by 50% will be identical to the 
impact of increasing the cost of threat assessments by 50%.  The impact of decreasing the 
assumed number of threat assessments valves by 50% will be identical to the impact of 
decreasing the cost of threat assessments by 50%.  The total cost and present value when 
the cost of threat assessments is increased or decreased by 50% are presented in Tables 
22 and 23.  Based on the results presented in those tables, the impact of changing the 
number of threat assessments is expected to be relatively minor. 
 
Impact of No Threat Assessment Updates 
 
The base case cost estimate includes no estimates of the costs associated with updating 
the threat assessments.  Updates will be required when conditions on, or surrounding, the 
pipelines change.  There is no way to predict the nature of the changes.  Consequently, 
there is no way to predict the costs of making those changes.  At most, the cost of an 
update will be equal to the cost of the original threat assessment, but it should usually be 
significantly less.  Given that the impact of preparing the original threat assessments is 
expected to be minimal, the impact of not including threat assessment updates in the cost 
analysis of the base case is also expected to be minimal.   
 
Impact of Patrolling Cost 
 
The base case estimates the cost of patrolling to be $100 per pipeline mile.  The cost may 
be higher or lower than that estimate.  Tables 24 and 25 present the total costs and present 
values when the cost of patrolling is increased or decreased by 50%.

Changing the patrolling cost by plus or minus 50% changes the present value of the total 
costs by 41% to 42% at the 3% discount rate.  Roughly, a change of 10% in the patrolling 
cost results in an 8% change in the present value of total costs.  The impact associated 
with changing the patrol cost is therefore relatively significant.   
 
Impact of Number of Patrols 
 
Based on the current regulatory requirements concerning patrolling, PHMSA assumes 
that the proposed rule would add 24 patrols annually.  This probably overstates the actual 
number of additional patrols that would be undertaken if the proposed rule were to be

implemented.  Tables 26 and 27 present the total costs and present values when the 
required number of additional patrols annually is decreased to 12 (i.e., by 50%).

Reducing the number of additional patrols to 12 reduces the present value of the total 
costs by approximately 42% at the 3% discount rate.  Roughly, each additional annual 
patrol adds approximately 3.5% (= 41% / 12 patrols) to the present value of the total 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
40 
costs.  The impact associated with changing the number of patrols is relatively 
significant.   
 
Impact of the Cost of Notification 
 
PHMSA currently requires natural gas transmission pipeline operators to submit annual 
reports.  Those reports are estimated to require 12 hours to prepare.  The hourly cost of 
the personnel preparing those reports is estimated to be $64.75, fully loaded.  Therefore, 
an annual report will cost an estimated $777 (= 12 hours x $64.75 per hour).  Preparing a 
notification required by the proposed rule is not expected to be any more complicated or 
time-consuming than preparing an annual report.  In fact, preparing an annual report is 
likely to be more complicated and time-consuming.  As a consequence, the impact of the 
uncertainties associated with the cost of notification is expected to be minimal.   
 
Impact Summary 
 
In summary, changes in pipeline mileage, changes in patrolling costs, and changes in the 
number of patrols all appear to have significant impacts on the costs of the proposed rule.  
The impacts on costs attributable to changing other assumptions are expected to be 
relatively minor.  
 
6.4 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
 
The benefits resulting from the proposed rule are estimated to be $103 million per year, 
consisting of $49.0 million in recurring benefits and $54.6 million in one-time benefits.  
The costs of the proposed rule, by year, are presented in Table 10.  Those costs are 
expected to be $43.9 million in the first year, increase linearly from $12.4 million in the 
second year to $25.8 million in the tenth year, be $46.2 million in the eleventh year, and 
then increase linearly from $32.3 million in the twelfth year to $45.7 million in the 
twentieth year.  Table 28 gives the present values for these estimated benefits and costs 
over 20 years at 3% and 7% discount rates. 
 
 
TABLE 28.  PRESENT VALUES OF THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE 
PROPOSED RULE CALCULATED OVER 20 YEARS 
(All dollars in millions) 
Discount Rate Benefits Costs 
3% $1,541 $435 
7% $1,098 $293 
 
 
As can be seen from Table 28, the present value of the estimated benefits of the proposed 
rule would be expected to significantly exceed the present value of the estimated costs.  
The present value net benefits of the proposed rule are expected to be positive:  $1.1 
billion at the 3% discount rate and $0.8 billion at the 7% discount rate.  The proposed 
rule is expected to be cost-beneficial.   
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
41 
 
It might be argued that the proposed rule effectively has much smaller benefits and costs 
than those estimated in this analysis, relative to the ability of pipeline operators to gain 
special permits that would put in place many of the same requirements of these rules.  
Those upgrading their pipelines under the proposed rule may be likely to apply for 
special permits absent the proposed rule.  Consequently, the benefits of the alternative 
MAOP could eventually be achieved even without the rule.  Furthermore, the costs to 
operators of using the alternative method to establish MAOP under the proposed rule 
would be similar, if not identical, to those incurred to meet the requirements mandated by 
PHMSA for special permits.  The primary benefit of the rule, if this argument is accepted, 
would be that it would relieve PHMSA of the cost and resource burden associated with 
evaluating and approving or rejecting special permits.   Even if one accepts this 
argument, however, PHMSA has concluded that the more efficient process outlined in 
this proposed rule will likely lead to a faster deployment of these new requirements, and 
therefore will likely accelerate the realization of the net benefits associated with adopting 
an alternative MAOP.   
 
6.5 Benefit and Cost Uncertainties 
 
A number of assumptions were made in the calculation of the benefits and costs of the 
proposed rule.  Those assumptions could potentially impact whether the net benefits of 
the proposed rule are positive or negative.   Present value estimates have been calculated 
for various benefit and cost assumption alternatives.  Table 29 below presents the net 
benefits for those alternatives when evaluated over 20 years with a 3% discount rate (the 
conclusions drawn using the 3% discount rate will be similar to those drawn using a 7% 
rate).  Table 29 also includes the benefit and cost base cases, so that they can be 
compared with the alternatives, as well.

Table Key:  “-“:  Mileage assumptions of benefit and cost alternatives are inconsistent with each other, so no net benefits were 
calculated. 
 
 
There are a total of 73 benefit/cost combinations with a calculated net present value of 
benefits in Table 29.  In all cases, the present value of benefits exceeds the present value 
of costs.  That is, there are positive net benefits.  Those net benefits range from $554 
million to $1,947 million.  Under all benefit/cost combinations evaluated, the 
implementation of the proposed rule would be cost-beneficial. 
 
7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
PHMSA proposes to revise the Federal pipeline safety regulations to allow operators of 
natural gas transmission pipelines to raise the stress level for certain pipelines (1) 
constructed of steel pipe manufactured using modern steel chemistry and rolling practices 
and standards, and (2) inspected and tested to more rigorous standards.  Under the 
proposed rule, an alternative method to determine MAOP, by class location, would be: 
 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
43 
• Class 1:  Greater than 72% of SMYS but less than or equal to 80% of SMYS 
• Class 2:  Greater than 60% of SMYS but less than or equal to 67% of SMYS 
• Class 3:  Greater than 50% of SMYS but less than or equal to 56% of SMYS   
• Class 4:  No alternative MAOP is proposed for class 4 locations 
 
This proposed rule mandates no action by the gas transmission pipeline operators.  As a 
result of the proposed rule, however, 3,500 miles of existing natural gas transmission 
pipeline are expected to be uprated to an alternative MAOP.  Furthermore, the proposed 
rule is expected to result in the operators of an additional 700 miles of new pipeline 
electing to use an alternative MAOP each year in the future. 
 
The quantified benefits resulting from the proposed rule are estimated for the first year 
after the rule goes into effect to be $49.0 million of annually recurring benefits (these 
benefits are realized in the first and in each subsequent year) and $54.6 million of one-
time benefits.  For the 700 miles of new pipeline added in each subsequent year, the 
quantified benefits are estimated to be $54.6 million each year from savings in capital 
expenditures. The quantified benefits consist of:  
 
• Fuel cost savings on existing pipelines 
• Capital expenditure savings on pipe for new pipelines 
 
The costs of the proposed rule are estimated to be $43.9 million in the first year, go from 
$12.4 million in the second year to $25.8 million in the tenth year, be $46.2 million in the 
eleventh year, and then go from $32.3 million in the twelfth year to $45.7 million in the 
twentieth year.  The costs attributable to the proposed rule are most likely to be incurred 
by operators for: 
 
• Performing baseline internal inspections 
• Performing additional internal inspections 
• Performing anomaly repairs 
• Installing remotely controlled valves on either side of high consequence areas 
(HCAs) 
• Preparing threat assessments 
• Patrolling pipeline rights-of-way  
• Notifying PHMSA  
 
The present value of the quantified benefits of the proposed rule is estimated to be $1.541 
million calculated over 20 years using a 3% discount rate and $1,098 million calculated 
over 20 years using a 7% discount rate.  The present value of the estimated costs of the 
proposed rule would be expected to be $435 million over 20 years using a 3% discount 
rate and $293 million over 20 years using a 7% discount rate.  The quantified benefits of 
the proposed rule exceed the costs.  Net benefits would be $1.1 billion at the 3% discount 
rate and $0.8 billion at the 7% discount rate.  The benefit-cost ratio for the proposed rule 
would be 3.5 at the 3% discount rate and 3.7 at the 7% discount rates.  The proposed rule 
is expected to be cost-beneficial.

The quantified benefits, it should be noted, do not capture the full benefits of the 
proposed rule.  Expected benefits of the proposed rule that cannot be readily quantified 
include 
 
• Reductions in incident consequences 
• Increases in pipeline capacity  
• Increases in line pack   
• Reductions in capital expenditures on compressors for new pipelines 
• Reductions in adverse environmental impacts 
• Other expected benefits 
 
PHMSA believes that these non-quantified benefits significantly increase the spread 
between the benefits and costs associated with the proposed rule.   
 
Because of potentially significant uncertainties in the benefit and cost estimates, 
alternative benefit and cost estimates were developed and alternative net benefits were 
calculated.  The net benefits for all alternatives were positive.  This would appear to 
support the conclusion that the proposed rule is cost-beneficial.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
 
 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires an agency to review 
regulations to assess their impact on small entities unless the agency determines that a 
rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.     
 
Need for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:  The proposed rule supports the Secretary 
of Transportation’s priorities by improving performance and harnessing 21st Century 
technologies.  Increasing operating pressure can ease supply constraints by boosting 
pipeline capacity by as much as 10 percent.  Increasing capacity also enhances pipeline 
efficiency.  This enhanced performance is made possible by technological advances in 
metallurgy and pipe manufacture, as well as by improved pipeline lifecycle management 
practices.  Pipelines built with improved steel pipe and operated in compliance with 
improved lifecycle management practices can operate safely at higher internal pressures.  
The technological advances decrease the risk of incipient flaws from manufacture or 
installation that can grow to failure over time due to the operating pressure.  Furthermore, 
improved life cycle management practices, which include rigorous testing, increase the 
opportunity for operators to detect flaws well before failure.  Because revised regulations 
allowing increased capacity encourage the use of newer pipeline materials and associated 
safety standards, the revised regulations should have a net positive effect on overall 
pipeline safety.   
 
Description of Actions:  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) is proposing changes to the Federal pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR Part 
192, which cover the transportation of natural gas by pipeline.  Specifically, PHMSA is 
proposing to allow operators of natural gas transmission pipelines to calculate an 
alternative maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) based on higher design 
factors for certain pipelines (1) constructed of steel pipe manufactured using modern steel 
chemistry, rolling practices, and standards, and (2) inspected and tested to more rigorous 
standards.  Operators meeting the required conditions may be allowed to use an 
“alternative” MAOP.  Under the proposed rule, the alternative MAOP for each class 
location in which pipelines may be operating would be as follows: 
 
• Class 1:  Greater than 72% of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) but less 
than or equal to 80% of SMYS 
• Class 2:  Greater than 60% of SMYS but less than or equal to 67% of SMYS 
• Class 3:  Greater than 50% of SMYS but less than or equal to 56% of SMYS   
• Class 4:  No alternative MAOP is proposed for class 4 locations 
 
Identification of potentially affected small entities:  The proposed rule would affect 
operators of gas transmission and gathering pipelines.  Based on submissions of annual 
reports, PHMSA estimates that approximately 1,450 local gas distribution utilities and 
1,450 gas transmission and gathering systems potentially would be affected by the 
Drr aa ff tt    Ree gg uu ll aa tt oo rr yy    II mpp aa cc tt    Ass ss ee ss ss mee nn tt  
 
46 
proposed rule.  The size distribution of these operators is unknown and must be 
estimated.   
 
The affected gas transmission and gathering systems all belong to NAICS 486210, 
Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas.  In accordance with the size standards published 
by the SBA, a business with $6.5 million or less in annual revenue is considered a small 
business in this NAICS.   
 
Based on information from Dunn & Bradstreet for August 2006, on firms in NAICS 
486210, PHMSA estimates that 33% of the gas transmission and gathering systems have 
$6.5 million or less in revenue.  Thus, PHMSA estimates that 479 (= 1,450 x 33%) of the 
gas transmission and gathering systems affected by the proposed rule will have $6.5 
million or less in annual revenue.  For this analysis, PHMSA does not expect that any 
local gas distribution companies will be taking advantage of the potential to use an 
alternative MAOP.   
 
The proposed rule mandates no action by gas transmission pipeline operators.  Rather, it 
provides those operators with the option of using an alternative MAOP in certain 
circumstances and when certain conditions can be met.  Consequently, it imposes no 
economic burden on the affected gas pipeline operators, large or small.   
 
Related Federal rules and regulations:  There are no related rules or regulations issued by 
other departments or agencies of the Federal Government. 
 
Alternate proposals for small businesses:  The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs agencies 
to establish exceptions and differing compliance standards for small businesses, where it 
is possible to do so and still meet the objectives of applicable regulatory statutes.     
 
The proposed rule mandates no action by the gas pipeline operators.  Consequently, 
alternative proposals for small business are unnecessary. 
 
Conclusion:  It can be concluded that this proposed rule applies to a substantial number 
of small entities.  No small entities, however, would experience a significant adverse 
economic impact as a result of the proposed rule.
