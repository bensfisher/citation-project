Administration 
20 CFR Part 655 
RIN 1205–AB61 
Wage Methodology for the Temporary 
Non-Agricultural Employment H–2B 
Program 
AGENCY: Employment and Training 
Administration, Labor. 
ACTION: Proposed rule; request for 
comments. 
SUMMARY: The Department of Labor (the 
Department or DOL) proposes to amend 
its regulations governing the 
certification of the employment of 
nonimmigrant workers in temporary or 
seasonal non-agricultural employment 
and the enforcement of the obligations 
applicable to employers of such 
nonimmigrant workers. This Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM or 
proposed rule) proposes to revise and 
solicits comments on the methodology 
by which the Department calculates the 
prevailing wages to be paid to H–2B 
workers and U.S. workers recruited in 
connection with a temporary labor 
certification for use in petitioning the 
Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) to employ a nonimmigrant 
worker in H–2B status. 
DATES: Interested persons are invited to 
submit written comments on the 
proposed rule on or before November 4, 
2010. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, 
identified by Regulatory Information 
Number (RIN) 1205–AB61, by any one 
of the following methods:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Revisions to 20 CFR 655.10 
A. Statutory Standard With Respect to 
Prevailing Wages and Current 
Department of Labor Regulations 
As provided by section 
101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (INA or Act) (8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)), the H–2B 
visa classification for non-agricultural 
temporary workers is available to a 
foreign worker ‘‘having a residence in a 
foreign country which he has no 
intention of abandoning who is coming 
temporarily to the United States to 
perform other [than agricultural] 
temporary service or labor if 
unemployed persons capable of 
performing such service or labor cannot 
be found in this country.’’ There is an 
annual cap of 66,000 H–2B 
nonimmigrant visa approvals per fiscal 
year, divided into two biannual 
allocations of 33,000 each. 
Section 214(c)(1) of the INA requires 
DHS to consult with appropriate 
agencies before approving an H–2B visa 
petition. 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1). The 
regulations for U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS), the 
agency within DHS which adjudicates 
requests for H–2B status, require that an 
intending employer first apply for a 
temporary labor certification from the 
Secretary of Labor (the Secretary). 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(6). That certification informs 
USCIS that U.S. workers capable of 
performing the services or labor are not 
available, and that the employment of 
the foreign worker(s) will not adversely 
affect the wages and working conditions 
of similarly employed U.S. workers. A 
certification from the Secretary is 
currently not required for H–2B 
employment on Guam, for which 
certification from the Governor of Guam 
is required. 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii). 
The Department’s regulations at 20 
CFR part 655, Subpart A, ‘‘Labor 
Certification Process for Temporary 
Employment in Occupations other than 
Agriculture or Registered Nursing in the 
United States (H–2B Workers),’’ govern 
the H–2B labor certification process, as 
well as the enforcement process to 
ensure U.S and H–2B workers are 
employed in compliance with H–2B 
labor certification requirements. 
Applications for labor certification are 
processed by the Office of Foreign Labor 
Certification (OFLC) in ETA, the agency 
to which the Secretary has delegated her 
responsibilities described in the USCIS 
H–2B regulations. Enforcement of the 
attestations made by employers in H–2B 
applications for labor certification is 
conducted by the Wage and Hour

61579 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 192 / Tuesday, October 5, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
Division (WHD) within DOL, to which 
DHS on January 16, 2009 delegated 
enforcement authority granted to it by 
the INA. 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14)(B). 
As a part of the process of applying 
to employ H–2B workers, an employer 
must ensure that it will pay the workers 
hired in connection with that 
application a wage that will not 
adversely affect the wages of U.S. 
workers similarly employed. To ensure 
that this requirement is met, the 
Department has established a process 
for providing to an employer a 
prevailing wage for the job opportunity, 
below which an employer may not pay 
its H–2B workers. Until 2005, the 
process of determining prevailing wages 
was governed by General 
Administration Letter (GAL) No. 2–98 
(1998). The process required by the 
1998 GAL made use of wage rates 
determined under the Davis-Bacon Act 
(DBA), 40 U.S.C. 276a et seq., 29 CFR 
part 1, or the McNamara-O’Hara Service 
Contract Act (SCA), 41 U.S.C. 351 et 
seq., wage rates mandatory for H–2B 
occupations for which such wage 
determinations existed. In the absence 
of DBA or SCA wage rates, prevailing 
wage determinations were based on the 
Occupational Employment Statistics 
wage survey (OES), compiled by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In May 
2005, as a result of legislation enacting 
section 212(p)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1182(p)(4), relating to the H–1B visa 
program, the Department issued 
guidance on prevailing wage 
determinations. The Department 
applied that guidance to H–2B labor 
certification applications as well as the 
H–1B temporary specialty worker and 
permanent labor certification programs. 
Under that guidance, prevailing wage 
determinations in these three visa 
programs were set based on four tiers 
tied to skill levels using the OES wage 
survey, while the use of DBA or SCA 
wage rates was at the option of the 
employer seeking the determination. 
The Department did not use notice and 
comment rulemaking when issuing that 
guidance. See ETA Prevailing Wage 
Determination Policy Guidance, Non- 
agricultural Immigration Programs (the 
Prevailing Wage Guidance), http:// 
www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/ 
NPWHC_Guidance_Revised_
11_2009.pdf. 
In 2008, the Department proposed and 
finalized regulations that currently 
govern the H–2B temporary worker 
program. 73 FR 29942, May 22, 2008; 73 
FR 78020, Dec. 19, 2008 (the 2008 Final 
Rule). The 2008 Final Rule essentially 
codified various aspects of the 2005 
prevailing wage guidance, including 
that the prevailing wage for labor 
certification purposes shall be the 
arithmetic mean of the wages of workers 
similarly employed at the skill level in 
the area of employment. 20 CFR 
655.10(b)(2). Additionally, the 2008 
Final Rule, in accordance with the 2005 
prevailing wage guidance, continued to 
require the use of the OES Survey in 
setting the prevailing wage, in the 
absence of a collective bargaining 
agreement, an employer-provided 
survey acceptable under 20 CFR 
655.10(f), or a request from the 
employer to use the DBA or SCA wage 
determinations. The 2008 Final Rule 
also transferred the process of 
determining prevailing wages from the 
State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) to 
OFLC but did not change the method for 
calculating the wages for H–2B workers 
and U.S. workers. The activity of 
calculating and issuing prevailing wage 
determinations (PWDs) based upon 
requests from employers seeking to use 
them in connection with a foreign labor 
certification program is now conducted 
by OFLC’s National Prevailing Wage 
Center (NPWC), previously named the 
National Prevailing Wage and Helpdesk 
Center, in Washington, DC; it is 
designated in the regulation by the 
generic National Processing Center, or 
NPC. 
B. The Need for New Rulemaking 
Because the 2008 Final Rule did not 
make any changes in the method by 
which wages for H–2B workers and U.S. 
workers are calculated and continued 
the four-tiered skill system, the 
Department did not seek comment in 
the rulemaking process on the sources 
of data used to set wage rates. Since the 
2008 Final Rule took effect, however, 
the Department has grown increasingly 
concerned that the current calculation 
method does not adequately reflect the 
appropriate wage necessary to ensure 
U.S. workers are not adversely affected 
by the employment of H–2B workers. 
Additionally, the prevailing wage 
calculation methodology became the 
subject of litigation. On August 30, 
2010, the U.S. District Court in the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 
Comité de Apoyo a los Trabajadores 
Agricolas (CATA) v. Solis, Civil No. 
2:09–cv–240–LP, 2010 WL 3431761 
(E.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 2010), ordered the 
Department to ‘‘promulgate new rules 
concerning the calculation of the 
prevailing wage rate in the H–2B 
program that are in compliance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act no later 
than 120 days from the date of this 
order.’’ The plaintiffs in CATA had 
challenged the Department’s use of skill 
levels in establishing prevailing wages 
and the Department’s reliance upon 
OES data in lieu of DBA and SCA rates. 
The court ruled that the Department had 
violated the Administrative Procedure 
Act when it did not adequately explain 
its reasoning for using skill levels as 
part of the H–2B prevailing wage 
determinations, and that it failed to 
consider comments relating to the 
choice of appropriate data sets in 
deciding to rely on OES data rather than 
DBA and SCA in setting the prevailing 
wage rates. 
Accordingly, in order to comply with 
the Court’s order and to appropriately 
establish a wage methodology that 
adequately protects U.S. and H–2B 
workers, the Department is engaging in 
this new rulemaking to provide the 
public with notice and opportunity to 
comment on a new proposed 
methodology to determine prevailing 
wages under the H–2B program. The 
Department anticipates further 
rulemaking that will address other 
aspects of the H–2B temporary worker 
program. 
C. § 655.10 Prevailing Wage 
The proposed rule would establish 
that the prevailing wage will be the 
highest of the following: Wages 
established under an agreed-upon 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA); a 
wage rate established under the DBA or 
SCA for that occupation in the area of 
intended employment; and the 
arithmetic mean wage rate established 
by the OES for that occupation in the 
area of intended employment. The 
employer would be required to pay the 
workers at least the highest of the 
prevailing wage as determined by the 
NPC, the Federal minimum wage, the 
State minimum wage and the local 
minimum wage. 
The NPRM proposes to include 
consideration of the use of DBA wages 
and SCA wages for those occupations 
for which wages have been determined 
under either of the two Acts for the area 
of intended employment. The WHD’s 
DBA survey program has undergone a 
significant re-engineering effort in the 
last 7 years, resulting in a greatly 
improved and timely prevailing wage 
rate determination process. The wage 
determinations are maintained by type 
of public construction project (e.g., 
residential, building, highway, and 
heavy), and they are issued on a county- 
by-county basis. In addition, they 
include more detail for crafts (e.g., they 
distinguish between rates paid to a 
pipefitter who performs HVAC work 
and one who does not). Presently, SCA 
wage determinations are based upon 
BLS’ National Compensation Survey 
and OES survey data, and in some cases 
Federal employee data is also used. SCA

1 Additionally, the decision issued by the court in 
Comité de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas 
(CATA) v. Solis, 2010 WL 3431761, at *19 n.22, 
which invalidated the application of the four-tier 
wage skill levels to the H–2B program, found that 
section 212(p)(4) of the INA is limited to the H–1B 
context (if the Department argued that it was ‘‘using 
skill levels because of the statute, that explanation 
would be irrational’’). 
2 DOL analysis shows that, in about 96 percent of 
the cases, the H–2B wage is lower than the mean 
of the OES wage rates for the same occupation. See 
footnote 6. 
wage determinations now are reviewed 
yearly. Therefore, the Department has 
revisited the issue of whether to require 
the consideration of these alternative 
prevailing wage rate sources and has 
concluded that process improvements 
have made these wage surveys 
appropriate for use in this program. 
During its long practice of making wage 
determinations under these statutes, the 
Department has invested significant 
time and resources in developing 
appropriate calculation methodologies 
and making decisions about appropriate 
sources of wage data which it must 
consider in order to preserve wage 
integrity for U.S. workers. 
The Department has concluded that 
the mandatory consideration of the DBA 
and/or SCA wages for purposes of PWDs 
will address several important policy 
objectives, including protecting U.S. 
worker wages. First, it will ensure that 
each PWD reflects the highest wage 
from the most accurate and diverse pool 
of government wage data available with 
respect to a job classification and area 
of intended employment. Second, it will 
ensure compliance with mandatory 
wage standards for certain occupations. 
In addition, many of the H–2B job 
classifications already have DBA or SCA 
wages associated with the occupations; 
therefore, reinstating the explicit use of 
these wages can prevent the 
undercutting of wages in the local 
market when they more accurately 
reflect local market wages. 
Furthermore, the proposed rule would 
eliminate the use of the four-tiered wage 
structure. The Department currently 
implements this four-tiered system in 
accordance with the 2005 Prevailing 
Wage Guidance. This guidance 
differentiates the wage tiers by the level 
of experience, education, and 
supervision required to perform the job 
duties, as required for H–1B wages by 
section 212(p)(4) of the INA, from which 
the four-tiered wage system is derived. 
For the reasons stated below, the 
Department proposes to amend the 
current four-tier practice for the H–2B 
program and proposes instead a single 
OES wage level for H–2B job 
opportunities based on the arithmetic 
mean of the OES wage data for the job 
opportunities in the area of intended 
employment. 
The Department has re-examined 
section 212(p)(4) of the INA and has 
concluded that the use of the skill levels 
mandated in that provision is not legally 
required in the H–2B program. Section 
212(p)(4) of the INA was enacted in the 
context of H–1B reform in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2005, and while it is the only paragraph 
in section 212(p) that does not reference 
any specific immigration programs to 
which it applies, it is embedded in the 
provisions dealing with prevailing 
wages for positions in the H–1B and 
permanent foreign labor categories. 
There is no legislative history indicating 
that it was or was not meant to apply 
only to the H–1B program. However, the 
other provisions of section 212(p), 
which were all added to the INA by 
Congress at the same time, all are 
specific in their application to H–1B, to 
the permanent program, or to both. 
None applies to the H–2B program.1 
Thus, the Department no longer believes 
that it is bound by section 212(p)(4) to 
offer four-tiered wage levels in the 
H–2B program. The Department has 
already eliminated the four-tiered wage 
levels in the H–2A program in its Final 
Rule on that program. 75 FR 6884 (Feb. 
12, 2010). 
The wage-setting procedures no 
longer require a single wage 
determining methodology as a matter of 
administrative efficiency, which was a 
concern at the time of issuance of the 
2005 Prevailing Wage Guidance. The 
Department, which had used a two- 
tiered wage system in its foreign labor 
certification programs before the 
enactment of section 212(p), 
implemented the four tiers in H–2B for 
administrative efficiency when it 
implemented them in the H–1B and 
permanent labor certification programs. 
At that time, the SWAs were responsible 
for providing all wage determinations. 
Training diverse State workforce staff 
around the country on multiple wage 
methodologies for different wage 
determination processes in foreign labor 
certification programs would have been 
difficult and would have inevitably 
resulted in inconsistent application and 
confusion, which is counterproductive 
to the Department’s mandate to ensure 
that H–2B employers do not offer wages 
that will adversely impact the wages of 
U.S. workers. However, the Department 
completed consolidation of its wage 
determination activities for its foreign 
labor programs in the NPWC in January 
2010. The use of a single Center to issue 
wage determinations ensures that wage 
calculations are applied consistently 
throughout a single program, thereby 
eliminating the need to use a single 
method of calculation for all programs 
for administrative efficiency. Indeed, as 
noted above, the Department already 
has stopped using the four-tiered system 
in the H–2A program as of the effective 
date of the H–2A Final Rule. 75 FR 6884 
(Feb. 12, 2010). 
The types of jobs found in the H–2B 
program involve few if any skill 
differentials necessitating tiered wage 
levels. The Department has an 
obligation to require H–2B employers to 
offer wages that do not adversely affect 
the wages of their U.S. workforce. By 
their very existence, however, multiple 
wage rates, particularly in a program in 
which most job opportunities have few 
or no skill requirements, stratify wages 
and inappropriately allow employers to 
force much of the wage-earning 
workforce into a lower wage. H–2B 
workers, most of whom fill jobs with 
low skill levels, are more likely to be 
classified at the low end of the wage 
tiers, ultimately adversely affecting the 
wages of U.S. workers in those same 
jobs. In addition, even if skill-based 
wage tiers were desirable as a 
theoretical matter, neither the OES nor 
any other comprehensive data series 
that we are aware of attempts to capture 
such variations. While the Department 
has, since 1998, created tiered wages by 
mathematically manipulating OES data 
in accordance with the statute, the 
actual OES survey instrument does not 
solicit data concerning the skill level of 
the workers whose wages are being 
reported. While the assumption that 
lower wages reflect lower skills (the 
basis for the current methodology) may 
have some validity in higher skilled 
occupations, there is no support for that 
assumption in the case of the lower- 
skilled occupations that predominate in 
the H–2B program. 
H–2B disclosure data from the last 10 
years demonstrates that many jobs for 
which employers seek H–2B workers— 
housekeepers, landscape workers, etc.— 
clearly require minimal skill to perform, 
have few special skill or experience 
requirements, and do not generally have 
career ladders. These jobs have typically 
resulted in a Level 1 (the lowest wage 
level) determination for the H–2B 
employer, because the jobs themselves 
do not require the employer to seek 
workers with higher skill levels. The 
result is a wage determination that is in 
fact lower than the average wage paid 
for many jobs that are of the same 
classification as those jobs filled under 
the H–2B program.2 By allowing jobs to 
be filled by H–2B workers at these lower 
wages, a tiered wage system can have a

3 Absent an increase in the number of workers 
under the H–2B program to fill the temporary labor 
shortage, wages for these temporary jobs would rise 
in order to dispel the shortage, until sufficient 
additional domestic labor is attracted into the 
market. These wage increases are avoided, however, 
under the prevailing wage requirements of the 
H–2B program as currently configured. Moreover, 
when H–2B wages are set lower than wages paid to 
U.S. workers in similar jobs, as they generally are 
under the tiered wage system, the H–2B wages may 
not actually reflect the economic value of the work, 
impeding any upward pressure on wages that 
would otherwise result from the labor shortage. 
depressive effect on wages of similar 
domestic workers, ultimately adversely 
affecting the wages of U.S. workers in 
those same jobs.3 The Department 
cannot continue to allow such wage 
depression where its mandate is to 
ensure that the wages of U.S. workers 
suffer no adverse impact. 
The Department, accordingly, 
proposes to require that the arithmetic 
mean of the OES wage rates be the basis 
for determining the OES component of 
the prevailing wage rate in the H–2B 
program as it is the most effective 
available method for preventing adverse 
effect on wages. The Department 
welcomes comment on specific 
alternatives for wage calculations to 
meet its mandate for avoiding adverse 
effect on wages while ensuring that 
wages reflect economic realities in the 
marketplace for such jobs. 
Finally, the H–2B regulations 
currently allow the use of an employer- 
provided survey to determine the 
prevailing wage when that survey meets 
certain methodological requirements, 
even if the survey produces a lower 
wage than the OES wage. The NPRM 
proposes to eliminate the use of private 
wage surveys in the H–2B program. 
After more than 10 years of successful 
experience with the OES, the 
Department has concluded that the 
review of such surveys is an inefficient 
and unnecessary expenditure of 
government resources. While private 
surveys can provide useful information, 
the cost of reviewing the surveys 
outweighs their utility. 
By eliminating the use of such 
employer-provided surveys, the 
proposed rule also eliminates the need 
for the 2008 Final Rule provision 
allowing employers to file supplemental 
information regarding the use of a 
survey, rendering current section 
655.10(g) at least partially moot. The 
section also references the submission 
of supplemental information when there 
is a disagreement with a wage level, 
which has also been rendered moot. As 
any other issue (such as the application 
of a DBA or SCA wage) can be appealed 
through the review of a PWD by the 
Certifying Officer or by BALCA through 
the procedures of section 655.11, the 
Department is removing paragraphs 
655.10(f) and (g) of the current rule. 
II. Administrative Information 
A. Executive Order 12866 
Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, 
the Department must determine whether 
a regulatory action is economically 
significant and therefore subject to the 
requirements of the E.O. and to review 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB). Section 3(f) of the E.O. 
defines an economically significant 
regulatory action as an action that is 
likely to result in a rule that: (1) Has an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more, or adversely and 
materially affects a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local or tribal 
governments or communities (also 
referred to as economically significant); 
(2) creates serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interferes with an action 
taken or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alters the budgetary impacts 
of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan 
programs, or the rights and obligations 
of recipients thereof; or (4) raises novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the E.O. 
The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has determined that this NPRM 
is an economically significant regulatory 
action under sec. 3(f)(1) of E.O. 12866. 
This regulation would likely result in 
transfers in excess of $100 million 
annually and consequently is 
economically significant. Accordingly, 
OMB has reviewed this NPRM. 
1. Need for Regulation 
The Department has determined for a 
variety of reasons that a new rulemaking 
effort is necessary for the H–2B program 
with respect to the wages paid to these 
workers. Chief among these reasons is 
the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania’s order 
and accompanying opinion in Comité 
de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas 
(CATA) v. Solis, Civil No. 2:09–cv–240– 
LP, 2010 WL 3431761 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 
2010), which invalidated the 
application of the four-tier wage skill 
levels to the H–2B program and required 
the Department to ‘‘promulgate new 
rules concerning the calculation of the 
prevailing wage rate in the H–2B 
program that are in compliance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act no later 
than 120 days from the date of this 
order.’’ The Department is concerned 
that the methodology for calculating 
prevailing wages at issue in the Court’s 
order does not adequately reflect the 
appropriate wage necessary to ensure 
U.S. workers are not adversely affected 
by the employment of H–2B workers. 
For these reasons, discussed in more 
detail above, the Department is 
proposing the changes contained in the 
NPRM. 
2. Alternatives 
Given the fact that the court’s order 
and accompanying opinion in Comité 
de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas 
(CATA) v. Solis, Civil No. 2:09–cv–240– 
LP, requires the Department to 
promulgate this NPRM, the Department 
has limited its consideration of 
alternatives of wage calculations to the 
following: (1) To continue the current 
calculation methodology but provide a 
more complete justification for doing so, 
and (2) to eliminate the four tiers and 
use the arithmetic mean. For use of 
alternative government sources, the 
Department considered continuing (1) 
the optional use of DBA and SCA and 
(2) making the use of such surveys 
mandatory. For alternative wage 
sources, the Department considered, in 
addition to the continued use of CBAs, 
(1) continuing the use of private 
employer surveys and (2) elimination of 
private surveys. 
The Department considered alternate 
data sources but given the time 
constraints imposed by the court’s 
order, we were unable to fully analyze 
these alternatives. We welcome 
comments from the public on 
alternatives for wage sources that 
provide adequate protections to U.S. 
and H–2B workers. 
The alternatives proposed in this 
NPRM are those that will best achieve 
the Department’s policy objectives of 
ensuring that wages of U.S. workers are 
more adequately protected and, thus, 
that employers are only permitted to 
bring H–2B workers into the country 
where the wages and working 
conditions of U.S. workers will not be 
adversely affected. We request 
comments from the public on 
alternatives for calculating a prevailing 
wage that provides adequate protections 
to U.S. and H–2B workers. 
3. Economic Analysis 
The Department’s analysis below 
considers the expected impacts of the 
proposed NPRM provisions against the 
baseline (i.e., the 2008 Final Rule). The 
method of determining prevailing wages 
represents additional compensation for 
both H–2B and U.S. workers hired in 
response to the required recruitment.

4 For the purpose of this analysis, H–2B workers 
are considered temporary residents of the U.S. 
5 A total of 30 applications were set aside due to 
invalid data. 
6 To perform this calculation, we assume that the 
weighted average wage of H–2B workers has the 
same distribution as the weighted average wage of 
the domestic workers. This may or may not be the 
case. While there is some uncertainty regarding this 
approach, it is the best methodology that can be 
applied given the available data. In about 4.1 
percent of cases, the H–2B hourly wage was higher 
than the OES wage; it is likely that, instead of 
declining, those wages would not change as a result 
of the rule, so in such cases, the wage differential 
was assumed to be zero. 
7 The Department does not believe the imposition 
of these wages will cause increases in the wage 
beyond that represented by the OES arithmetic 
mean. A CBA wage may in fact be the highest of 
the applicable wages; even under the 2008 Final 
Rule, if the job opportunity were covered by a CBA, 
the wage rate set forth in the CBA would be the 
required wage. Accordingly, including the wage 
rate set forth in the CBA among the definition of 
prevailing wage will not result in an increased cost 
to the employer. As for the application of SCA and 
DBA to the PWD, in most cases, the SCA wage 
should not result in an increased cost to employers 
because in most cases, the SCA wage is based upon 
the OES mean. The application of DBA wages, and 
their potential impact on the relative wage increase, 
cannot be determined at this time, because the 
situations in which DBA would be higher than the 
location-specific OES arithmetic mean cannot be 
determined with sufficient accuracy to permit 
calculation. As a result, this analysis assumes that 
the OES wage will represent the highest of the three 
alternatives.

9 Source for total employment by industry: 2007 
Economic Census. 
10 The number of visas available under the H–2B 
program is 66,000, assuming no statutory increases 
in the number of visas available for entry in a given 
year. We also assume that half of all such workers 
(33,000) in any year stay at least one additional 
year, and half of those workers (16,500) will stay 
a third year, for a total of 115,500 H–2B workers in 
a given year. The scale factor was derived by 
dividing 115,500 by the total number of workers 
certified per year on average during FY2007–2009 
(236,706). 
11 The output reduction impact of reducing labor 
demand may be partially offset by capital 
The relevant benefits, costs, and 
transfers that may apply are discussed.4 
The NPRM proposes to require 
employers to offer H–2B workers and 
U.S. workers hired in response to the 
recruitment required as part of the 
application a wage that is at least equal 
to the highest of the prevailing wage, or 
the Federal, State or local minimum 
wage. The prevailing wage is the highest 
of the following: (1) The wage rate set 
forth in the CBA, if the job opportunity 
is covered by a CBA that was negotiated 
at arms’ length between the union and 
the employer; (2) the wage rate 
established under the Davis-Bacon Act 
or the McNamara-O’Hara Service 
Contract Act for the occupation in the 
area of intended employment, if the job 
opportunity is in an occupation for 
which such a wage rate has been 
determined; and (3) the arithmetic mean 
of the OES-reported wage. 
To estimate the proposed hourly 
change in wages, the Department 
collected H–2B program participation 
data for fiscal year (FY) 2009. We then 
matched the OES wage rates to the H– 
2B data for the same period by standard 
occupational code (SOC). Using all 
certified or partially certified 
applications in the H–2B program data, 
we calculated the increase in wages by 
subtracting the average H–2B hourly 
wage certified from the average OES 
average hourly wage, and we weighted 
this differential by the number of 
certified workers on each certified or 
partially certified application.5 We then 
summed those products and divided the 
sum by the total number of certified 
workers of all certified or partially 
certified applications.6 Based on this 
calculation, the proposed change in the 
method of determining wages will result 
in a $4.38 increase in the weighted 
average hourly wage for H–2B workers 
and similarly employed U.S. workers 
hired in response to the recruitment 
required as part of the application.7 
The Department provides an 
assessment of transfer payments 
associated with increases in wages 
resulting from the change in the wage 
determination method. Transfer 
payments, as defined by OMB Circular 
A–4, are payments from one group to 
another that do not affect total resources 
available to society. Transfer payments 
are associated with a distributional 
effect, but do not result in additional 
benefits or costs to society. The primary 
recipients of transfer payments reflected 
in this analysis are H–2B workers and 
any U.S. workers hired in response to 
the required recruitment under the 
H–2B program. The primary payors of 
transfer payments reflected in this 
analysis will be H–2B employers, and 
under the proposed higher wages in the 
NPRM, those employers who choose to 
continue to participate are likely to be 
those that have the greatest need to 
access the H–2B program. When 
summarizing the benefits or costs of 
specific provisions of this proposed 
rule, we present the 10-year averages to 
reflect the typical annual effect. 
Employment in the H–2B program 
represents a very small fraction of the 
total employment in the U.S. economy, 
both overall and in the industries 
represented in the program. The H–2B 
program is capped at 66,000 visas 
issued per year (33,000 of which are 
made available biannually), which 
represents approximately 0.05 percent 
of total nonfarm employment in the U.S. 
economy (130.9 million).8 According to 
H–2B program data for FY 2007–2009, 
the average annual numbers of H–2B 
workers certified in the top five 
industries were as follows: 
Construction—30,242; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation—14,041; 
Landscaping Services—78,027; 
Janitorial Services—30,902; and Food 
Services and Drinking Places—22,948. 
These employment numbers represent 
the following percentages of the total 
employment in each of these industries: 
Construction—0.4 percent (30,242/ 
7,265,648); Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation—0.9 percent (14,041/ 
1,506,120); Landscaping Services—13.2 
percent (78,027/589,698); Janitorial 
Services—3.3 percent (30,902/933,245); 
and Food Services and Drinking 
Places—0.2 percent (22,948/9,617,597).9 
These percentages decrease further 
when scaled to the actual number of 
entries permitted each year: 
Construction—0.2 percent (14,756/ 
7,265,648); Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation—0.5 percent (6,851/ 
1,506,120); Landscaping Services—6.5 
percent (38,073/589,698); Janitorial 
Services—1.6 percent (15,079/933,245); 
and Food Services and Drinking 
Places—0.1 percent (11,197/ 
9,617,597).10 As these data illustrate, the 
H–2B program represents a small 
fraction of the total employment even in 
each of the top five industries in which 
H–2B workers are found—less than 1 
percent in most of the categories. 
i. Costs 
In standard economic models of labor 
supply and demand, an increase in the 
wage rate represents an increased 
production cost to employers leading to 
a reduction in the demand for labor. 
Because production costs increase with 
an increase in the wage rate, a resulting 
decrease in profits is possible for H–2B 
employers that are unable to increase 
prices to cover the cost increase. Some 
H–2B employers, however, can be 
expected to offset the cost increase by 
increasing the price of their products or 
services. In addition, workers who 
would have been hired at a lower wage 
rate are not hired at the higher wage 
rate, resulting in forgone earnings for 
workers. In this theoretical sense, to the 
extent that the higher wages imposed by 
the rule result in lower employment and 
lower output by firms employing those 
workers, the lost profits on the foregone 
output and the lost net wages to the 
foregone workers represent a 
deadweight loss because these gains 
from trade are not attained. This effect 
will be magnified during years in which 
the cap is not reached.11

substitution and organizational substitution 
productivity effects. When substitution occurs, the 
deadweight loss will be reduced. Substitution may 
also involve outsourcing of production elements, 
which may entail a net welfare loss to the U.S. if 
outsourcing to a supplier overseas, but only a 
transfer if outsourcing to a supplier in the U.S. 
12 See, e.g., Hamermesh, Daniel S., Labor 
Demand, Princeton and Chichester, U.K.: Princeton 
University Press, 1993. 
13 DOL believes that any decline in employment 
among employers participating in the H–2B 
program will be offset by increased employment 
among new employers who previously were unable 
to hire workers under the H–2B program. Therefore, 
there would be no appreciable decline in 
employment under the program. 
14 See note 11, which explains that the 
Department assumes that 50 percent of workers 
entering the H–2B program in one year will remain 
in the country the following year and that 50 
percent of those will remain in the country for a 
third year. The Department data with regard to 
certified applications cannot be used to determine 
the actual number of H–2B workers in the country. 
Certifications are made without regard to the cap on 
the number of H–2B workers admissible each year 
and are not intended to indicate whether a worker 
actually entered the country to fill a position. 
Additionally, available DHS data rely on total 
entries of H–2B workers, which may or may not 
equal the admissions of H–2B workers in a given 
year. See http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/
statistics/yearbook/2009/table25d.xls. The 
Department of State keeps records of visas issued 
but does not publicly break down these numbers 
based on subcategories within the H category. 
http://travel.state.gov/visa/statistics/nivstats/
nivstats_4582.html. 
15 Our analysis focuses on the costs related to 
H–2B workers because of the lack of data on U.S. 
workers hired in response to recruitment conducted 
in connection with an H–2B application. 
16 For the number of hours worked per day, we 
use 7 hours as typical for an average. For the 
number of days worked, we assume that the 
employer would retain the H–2B worker for the 
maximum time allowed (10 months, or 304 days [10 
months × 30.42 days]) and would employ the 
workers for 5 days per week. Thus, total number of 
days worked equals 217 [10 months × 30.42 days 
× (5⁄7)]. 
In a practical sense, because the total 
employment under the H–2B program is 
capped at 66,000 visas, the 
macroeconomic effect of reductions in 
H–2B employment and therefore 
reductions in output is expected to be 
minimal. There has generally been 
excess demand for H–2B workers well 
beyond the 66,000 limit, and DOL 
believes that the increased wages 
resulting from the proposed rule will 
not result in fewer than 66,000 visas for 
H–2B workers because, even if some 
employers decide not to participate in 
the H–2B program, other employers who 
previously had unfilled positions will 
participate. 
For example, for the years FY2007 
through 2009, employers applied for an 
average of 236,706 certified H–2B 
positions per year. This number reflects 
the number of positions certified, rather 
than the number of actual workers who 
entered to take up those positions, 
which is capped at 66,000 per year. 
Using this number of certified workers 
to represent the quantity of labor 
demanded, and assuming an elasticity 
of labor demand of ¥0.3,12 a $4.38 (51 
percent) increase in wages would result 
in a 15 percent decline in the number 
of H–2B workers requested by 
employers, for a remaining total of 
201,200 H–2B certified positions 
requested by employers, which still far 
exceeds the 66,000 maximum visas 
allowed under the H–2B program. 
Therefore, any loss of production 
resulting from some employers 
dropping out of the program will be 
offset by production by other employers 
that would then be able to employ 
H–2B workers. Thus, DOL believes that 
for years in which the number of 
applications exceeds the number 
available under the cap, there will be no 
deadweight loss in the market for H–2B 
workers even if some employers do not 
participate in the program as a result of 
the higher H–2B wages.13 Indeed, the 
higher wages expected to result from the 
proposed rule could in turn result in a 
more efficient distribution of H–2B visas 
to employers who can less easily 
employ U.S. workers. DOL believes that 
those employers who can more easily 
attract U.S. workers will be dissuaded 
from attempting to participate in the 
H–2B program after the proposed rule 
changes, so that those employers 
participating in the H–2B program after 
the proposed rule will have a greater 
need for the program, on average, than 
those employers participating in the 
H–2B program before the proposed 
changes. 
In years in which the number of 
certified H–2B positions is less than the 
66,000 visa cap, the higher proposed 
wages resulting from this NPRM could 
be expected to result in a reduction in 
employment of H–2B workers and 
therefore a reduction in output by 
employers participating in the H–2B 
program. This employment reduction 
would be expected to be partially offset 
by increased employment of U.S. 
workers to the extent that employers 
could attract U.S. workers (by offering 
higher wages, for example) or could 
make other adjustments, such as 
substituting capital for labor, but, in a 
theoretical sense, the reduction in 
employment and output would not be 
completely offset, potentially resulting 
in some deadweight loss in production 
among H–2B employers. However, the 
history of the H–2B program suggests 
that this situation is rare. In recent 
history, the number of H–2B visas has 
reached the 66,000 cap every year 
except 2009. 
ii. Transfers 
The proposed change in the method 
of determining wages results in transfers 
from H–2B workers to U.S. workers and 
from U.S. employers to both U.S. 
workers and H–2B workers. 
A transfer from H–2B workers to U.S. 
workers arises because, as recruitment 
wages for U.S. workers increase, a larger 
number of U.S. workers may be 
attracted to work in jobs that would 
otherwise be occupied by H–2B 
workers. Additionally, faced with 
higher H–2B wages, some employers 
may find domestic workers relatively 
less expensive and may choose not to 
participate in the H–2B program and 
instead employ U.S. workers. While 
some of these U.S. workers may be 
drawn from other employment, some of 
them would otherwise remain 
unemployed or out of the labor force 
entirely, earning no salary. 
The Department, however, is not able 
to quantify these transfer payments with 
precision. Difficulty in calculating these 
transfer payments arises primarily from 
uncertainty about the number of U.S. 
workers currently collecting 
unemployment insurance benefits who 
will become employed as a result of this 
rule. 
To estimate the total transfer to H–2B 
workers via the increased wages 
resulting from the new wage 
determination method, the Department 
multiplied the total number of H–2B 
workers (115,500, which includes both 
new entrants and an assumed portion of 
those who entered in each of the two 
previous years),14 by the weighted 
average hourly wage increase ($4.38), 
the number of hours worked per day (7), 
and the total number of days worked 
(217).15,16 We estimate the total annual 
average transfer incurred due to the 
increase in wages at $769.4 million. As 
a result, OMB has determined that the 
proposed rule is an economically 
significant rule. 
The increase in the wage rates 
induces a transfer from participating 
employers not only to H–2B workers, 
but also to workers hired in response to 
the required recruitment. The higher 
wages are beneficial to U.S. workers 
because they enhance workers’ ability to 
meet the cost of living and to spend 
money in their local communities, 
which has the secondary impact of 
increasing economic activity in the 
community. These are important 
concerns to the current Administration 
and a key aspect of the Department’s 
mandate to ensure that wages of 
similarly employed U.S. workers are not 
adversely affected.

under the H–2B program is 66,000, assuming no

B. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, as amended (RFA), requires 
agencies to prepare regulatory flexibility 
analyses and make them available for 
public comment when proposing 
regulations that will have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. See 5 U.S.C. 
603. If the rule is not expected to have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, the 
RFA allows an agency to certify such, in 
lieu of preparing an analysis. See 5 
U.S.C. 605. For the reasons explained in 
this section, the Department believes 
this NPRM is not likely to impact a 
substantial number of small entities 
and, therefore, an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required by the 
RFA. However, in the interest of 
transparency and to provide a full 
opportunity for public comment, we 
have prepared the following Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis to assess 
the impact of this regulation on small 
entities, as defined by the applicable 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
size standards. We specifically request 
comments on the following burden 
estimates, including the number of 
small entities affected by the 
requirements, and on alternatives that 
could reduce the burden on small 
entities. The Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration was notified of a draft of 
this proposed rule upon submission of 
the proposed rule to OMB under E.O. 
12866, as amended, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review’’ 58 FR 51735, Oct. 
4, 1993; 67 FR 9385, Feb. 28, 2002; 72 
FR 2763, Jan. 23, 2007. 
Because employers seeking to 
participate in the H–2B program are 
derived from virtually all segments of 
the economy and across industries, 
those participating businesses are a 
small portion of the national economy 
overall. A Guide for Government 
Agencies: How to Comply with the RFA, 
Small Business Administration, at 20 
(‘‘the substantiality of the number of 
businesses affected should be 
determined on an industry-specific 
basis and/or the number of small 
businesses overall’’). 
Employment in the H–2B program 
represents a very small fraction of the 
total employment in the U.S. economy, 
both overall and in the industries 
represented in the H–2B program. The 
H–2B program is capped at 66,000 visas 
issued per year, which represents 
approximately 0.05 percent of total 
nonfarm employment in the U.S. 
economy (130.9 million).17 According to 
H–2B program data for FY2007–2009, 
the average annual numbers of H–2B 
workers certified in the top five 
industries were as follows: 
Construction—30,242; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation—14,041; 
Landscaping Services—78,027; 
Janitorial Services—30,902; and Food 
Services and Drinking Places—22,948. 
When the number of workers certified is 
scaled to reflect the actual number of 
entries permitted each year, given the 
H–2B visa cap of 66,000 workers, the 
data reflect that H–2B workers represent 
the following percentages of the total 
employment in each of these industries: 
Construction—0.2 percent (14,756/ 
7,265,648); Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation—0.5 percent (6,851/ 
1,506,120); Landscaping Services—6.5 
percent (38,073/589,698); Janitorial 
Services—1.6 percent (15,079/933,245); 
and Food Services and Drinking 
Places—0.1 percent (11,197/ 
9,617,597).18 As these data illustrate, the 
H–2B program represents a small 
fraction of the total employment even in 
each of the top five industries in which 
H–2B workers are found. 
1. Description of the Reasons That 
Action by the Agency Is Being 
Considered 
The Department has determined for a 
variety of reasons that a new rulemaking 
effort is necessary for the H–2B program 
with respect to the wages paid to these 
workers. Chief among these reasons is 
the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania’s order 
and accompanying opinion in Comité 
de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas 
(CATA) v. Solis, Civil No. 2:09–cv–240– 
LP, 2010 WL 3431761 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 
2010), which invalidated the 
application of the four-tier wage skill 
levels to the H–2B program and required 
the Department to ‘‘promulgate new 
rules concerning the calculation of the 
prevailing wage rate in the H–2B 
program that are in compliance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act no later 
than 120 days from the date of this 
order.’’ The Department is concerned 
that the methodology for calculating 
prevailing wages at issue in the Court’s 
order does not adequately reflect the 
appropriate wage necessary to ensure 
U.S. workers are not adversely affected 
by the employment of H–2B workers. 
2. Succinct Statement of the Objectives 
of, and Legal Basis for, the Proposed 
Rule 
The Department has grown 
increasingly concerned that the current 
prevailing wage calculation method 
does not adequately reflect the 
appropriate wage necessary to ensure 
U.S. workers are not adversely affected 
by the employment of H–2B workers. 
Accordingly, the Department is 
proposing to establish a new wage 
methodology that adequately protects 
U.S. and H–2B workers. The legal basis 
for the proposed rule is the 
Department’s authority, as delegated 
from DHS under its regulations at 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(6), to grant temporary labor 
certifications under the H–2B program. 
Additionally, as discussed earlier, the 
Department is subject to an order from 
the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania to 
‘‘promulgate new rules concerning the 
calculation of the prevailing wage rate 
in the H–2B program that are in 
compliance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act no later than 120 days 
from the date of this order.’’ Comité de 
Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas 
(CATA) v. Solis, Civil No. 2:09–cv–240– 
LP, 2010 WL 3431761 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 
2010). 
3. Description of, and Where Feasible, 
an Estimate of the Number of Small 
Entities to Which the Proposed Rule 
Will Apply 
Definition of a Small Business 
A small entity is one that is 
independently owned and operated and 
that is not dominant in its field of 
operation. The definition of small 
business varies from industry to 
industry to properly reflect industry size 
differences. An agency must either use 
the SBA definition for a small entity or 
establish an alternative definition for 
the industry. The Department has 
conducted a small entity impact 
analysis on small businesses in the five 
industries with the largest number of 
H–2B workers and for which data were 
available, as mentioned above: 
Landscaping Services; Janitorial 
Services (includes housekeeping 
services); Food Services and Drinking 
Places; Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation; and Construction. These top 
five industries accounted for almost 75 
percent of the total number of H–2B

19 According to H–2B program data, the average 
annual number of firms (of all sizes) and H–2B 
workers certified for these industries during 
FY2007–2009 were as follows: Landscaping 
Services, Firms—2,754, Workers—78,027; Janitorial 
Services, Firms—788, Workers—30,902; Food 
Services and Drinking Places, Firms—851, 
Workers—22,948; Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation, Firms—227, Workers—14,041; and 
Construction, Firms—860, Workers—30,242. 
20 The SBA small business size standards for 
construction range from $7 million (land 
subdivision) to $33.5 million (general building and 
heavy construction). However, because employers 
representing all types of construction businesses 
may apply for certification to employ H–2B 
workers, the Department used an average of $20.7 
million as the size standard for construction. 
21 The total number of firms classified as small 
entities in these industries is as follows: 
Landscaping Services, 63,210; Janitorial Services, 
45,495; Food Services and Drinking Places, 293,373; 
Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation, 43,726; and 
Construction, 689,040. 
22 Source: 2002 County Business Patterns and 
2002 Economic Census. These data do not 
distinguish between U.S. workers and foreign 
workers. 
23 The Department does not believe the 
imposition of these wages will cause increases in 
the wage beyond that represented by the OES 
arithmetic mean. A CBA wage may in fact be the 
highest of the applicable wages; even under the 
2008 Final Rule, if the job opportunity were 
covered by a CBA, the wage rate set forth in the 
CBA would be the required wage. Accordingly, 
including the wage rate set forth in the CBA among 
the definition of prevailing wage will not result in 
an increased cost to the employer. As for the 
application of SCA and DBA to the PWD, in most 
cases, the SCA wage is equivalent to the arithmetic 
mean of the OES wage, and will also not result in 
an increased cost to employers beyond that 
represented by the change in the OES from the four 
tiers to the arithmetic mean. The application of 
DBA wages, and their potential impact on the 
relative wage increase, cannot be determined at this 
time. As a result, this analysis assumes that the OES 
wage will represent the highest of the three 
alternatives. 
workers certified during FY2007– 
2009.19 
One industry, Forest Services, made 
the initial top-five list but is not 
included in this analysis because the 
only data available for forestry also 
include various agriculture, fishing, and 
hunting activities. Relevant data for 
Forestry only were not available. The 
Department requests the public to 
propose possible sources of data or 
information on the revenues and 
average number of workers of a typical 
small Forestry firm. 
We have adopted the SBA small 
business size standard for each of the 
five industries, which is a firm with 
annual revenues equal to or less than 
the following: Landscaping Services, $7 
million; Janitorial Services, $16.5 
million; Food Services and Drinking 
Places, $7 million; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation, $7 million; 
and Construction, $20.7 million.20 
The Department has used 
representative data because actual data 
regarding entity size is not uniformly 
collected in the H–2B program. The 
Department added information 
collection elements surrounding entity 
size, revenue, and number of all 
employees in early 2009, specifically to 
obtain information regarding the size 
and status of program participants. This 
would provide the Department with a 
little over a year of program data 
regarding participants’ size and status. 
However, these data elements are not 
required to be provided in order for an 
employer to submit the Application for 
Temporary Employment Certification, 
and employers accordingly have the 
option of not providing information 
about their size, employee complement, 
and revenues without penalty in the 
application process. As a result, the 
information on the size and status of 
program participants that has been 
collected since 2009 is therefore not 
sufficient to provide to the Department 
statistically valid data to use in 
analyzing the actual impact on small 
businesses. 
4. Description of the Projected 
Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other 
Compliance Requirements of the 
Proposed Rule 
The proposed rule does not impose 
any reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements. 
With regard to other compliance 
requirements, the Department has 
estimated the incremental costs for 
small businesses from the baseline. For 
this proposed rule, the baseline is the 
2008 Final Rule. This Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis reflects the 
incremental cost of this rule as it adds 
to the requirements in the 2008 Final 
Rule. Using available data, we have 
estimated the costs of the increased 
wages and the time required to read and 
review the Final Rule. 
The Department receives an average 
of 8,717 applications annually (which is 
not necessarily the same as the number 
of applicants, because one employer 
may file more than one application) for 
the H–2B program, and the Department 
estimates that an average of 6,980 of 
those applications result in petitions for 
H–2B workers that are approved by 
DHS. Even if all 6,980 applications are 
filed by unique small entities, the 
percentage of small entities authorized 
to employ temporary non-agricultural 
workers will be less than 1 percent of 
the total number of small entities in 
these industries.21 Based on this 
analysis, the Department estimates that 
the rule will impact less than 1 percent 
of the total number of small businesses. 
A detailed industry-by-industry analysis 
is provided below. 
To examine the impact of this 
proposed rule on small entities, the 
Department evaluates the impact of the 
incremental costs on a hypothetical 
small entity of average size, in terms of 
the total number of both U.S. and 
foreign workers, in each industry if it 
were to fill 50 percent of its workforce 
with H–2B workers. There are no 
available data to estimate the 
breakdown of the workforce into U.S. 
and foreign workers. Based on 
Economic Census data, the total number 
of workers (including both U.S. and 
foreign workers) for this hypothetical 
small business is as follows: 
Landscaping Services, 2.3 workers; 
Janitorial Services, 11.3 workers; Food 
Services and Drinking Places, 6.3 
workers; Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation, 5.0 workers; and 
Construction, 6.3 workers.22 
Also using Economic Census data, we 
derived the annual revenues for small 
entities in each of the top five industries 
by multiplying the average number of 
workers by the average revenue per 
worker for each of the industries. The 
Department estimates that small 
businesses in the top five industries 
have the following annual revenues: 
Landscaping Services, $0.181 million; 
Janitorial Services, $0.336 million; Food 
Services and Drinking Places, $0.223 
million; Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recreation, $0.209 million, and 
Construction, $0.884 million. 
a. Change in the Method of Determining 
Wages for H–2B Workers 
The Department proposes to require 
employers to offer H–2B workers and to 
any similarly employed U.S. worker 
hired in response to the recruitment 
required as part of the application a 
wage that is at least equal to the 
prevailing wage, or the Federal, State or 
local minimum wage, whichever is 
highest. The prevailing wage is the 
highest of the following: (1) The wage 
rate set forth in the CBA, if the job 
opportunity is covered by a CBA that 
was negotiated at arms’ length between 
the union and the employer; (2) the 
wage rate established under the Davis- 
Bacon Act or the McNamara-O’Hara 
Service Contract Act for the occupation 
in the area of intended employment if 
the job opportunity is in an occupation 
for which such a wage rate has been 
determined; and (3) the arithmetic mean 
of the OES-reported wage.23 
To estimate the proposed hourly 
change in wages, the Department 
collected H–2B program participation 
data for FY2009. We then matched the 
OES wage rates to the H–2B data for the 
VerDate Mar<15>2010 19:13 Oct 04, 2010 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\05OCP2.SGM 05OCP2hs

24 A total of 30 applications were set aside due 
to invalid data. 
25 These wage increases reflect the differences 
between the OES wages and the H–2B wages for the 
occupations most closely associated with each 
industry. This estimate may slightly understate the 
wage increase because cases in which the H–2B 
wages were higher than OES wages would bias the 
estimate downward; however, this occurred in only 
about 4.1 percent of all cases. 
26 For the number of hours worked per day, we 
use 7 hours as typical for an average. For the 
number of days worked, we assume that the 
employer would retain the H–2B worker for the 
maximum time allowed (10 months, or 304 days [10 
months × 30.42 days]) and would employ the 
workers for 5 days per week. Thus, total number of 
days worked equals 217 [10 months × 30.42 days 
× (5⁄7)]. 
27 The hourly compensation rate for a human 
resources manager is calculated by multiplying the 
hourly wage of $42.95 (as published by the 
Department’s OES survey, O*NET Online) by 1.43 
to account for private-sector employee benefits 
(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics). Thus, the 
loaded hourly compensation rate for a human 
resources manager is $61.42. 
28 The number of small businesses that will read 
and review the Final Rule is likely to include some 
that will not apply for the program. There are no 
available data to quantify this possible effect. 
29 The source of the numerator (i.e., the number 
of certified H–2B employers) is H–2B program data 
for FY2007–2009. The source of the denominator 
(i.e., the total number of U.S. businesses meeting 
the SBA small-size criteria) is the 2002 County 
Business Patterns and 2002 Economic Census. 
http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/data/ 
susb2002.html. We multiply the numerator by 0.50 
to reflect our assumption that 50 percent of H–2B 
employers are small businesses. 
same period by SOC. Using all certified 
or partially certified applications in the 
H–2B program data, we calculated the 
increase in wages for each industry by 
subtracting the H–2B hourly wage 
certified from the OES average hourly 
wage and then estimated the average of 
those differences for each industry.24 
These calculations yielded the 
following hourly wage increases by 
industry associated with this proposed 
rule: Landscaping services, $3.60; 
Janitorial Services, $3.72; Food Services 
and Drinking Places, $1.29; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation, $1.37; and 
Construction, $10.61.25 
To estimate the total cost to the 
average small entity of increased wages 
for H–2B workers due to the new wage 
determination method, the Department 
multiplied the average hourly increase 
in wages for the top five industries by 
the average total number of days worked 
by H–2B workers, the number of hours 
worked per day, and the average 
number of H–2B workers employed by 
small entities in each of the top five 
industries.26 Our estimates of the total 
annual average cost incurred due to the 
increase in wages for the average small 
employer in the top five industries are 
as follows: Landscaping Services, 
$6,562 ($3.60 × 217 × 7 × 1.2); Janitorial 
Services, $32,209 ($3.72 × 217 × 7 × 5.7); 
Food Services and Drinking Places, 
$6,270 ($1.29 × 217 × 7 × 3.2); 
Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation, 
$5,203 ($1.37 × 217 × 7 × 2.5); and 
Construction, $51,573 ($10.61 × 217 × 7 
× 3.2). 
b. Reading and Reviewing the New 
Processes and Requirements 
During the first year that this rule 
would be in effect, employers would 
need to learn about the new PWD. We 
estimate this cost for a hypothetical 
small entity which is interested in 
applying for H–2B workers by 
multiplying the time required to read 
the new rule and any educational and 
outreach materials that explain the wage 
calculation methodology under the rule 
by the average compensation of a 
human resources manager.27 In the first 
year of the rule, the Department 
estimates that the average small 
business participating in the program 
will spend approximately 1 hour of staff 
time to read and review the new 
regulation, which amounts to 
approximately $61.42 ($61.42 × 1) in 
labor costs in the first year.28 
c. Total Cost Burden for Small Entities 
The Department’s calculations 
indicate that for a hypothetical small 
entity in the top five industries that 
applies for one worker (representing the 
smallest of the small entities that hire 
H–2B workers), the total average annual 
costs of the NPRM are as follows: 
Landscaping Services, $5,794; Janitorial 
Services, $5,976; Food Services and 
Drinking Places, $2,281; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation, $2,402, and 
Construction, $16,455. Similarly, the 
analogous costs for employers in the top 
five industries that hire the average 
number of H–2B workers for their 
respective industries are as follows: 
Landscaping Services, $6,638; Janitorial 
Services, $33,004; Food Services and 
Drinking Places, $6,832; Amusement, 
Gambling, and Recreation, $5,760, and 
Construction, $51,481. 
The proposed rule is expected to have 
a significant economic impact on a 
hypothetical small entity that applied 
for enough workers to fill 50 percent of 
its workforce. While applying to hire 
H–2B workers is voluntary, and any 
employer (small or otherwise) may 
entirely avoid costs associated with the 
proposed changes by choosing not to 
apply, an employer, whether it 
continues to participate in the H–2B 
program or fills its workforce with U.S. 
workers, could face sizeable costs. 
However, increased employment 
opportunities for U.S. workers and 
higher wages for both H–2B and U.S. 
workers provide a broad societal benefit 
that in the Department’s view outweighs 
these costs. 
The small entities that have 
historically applied for H–2B workers, 
however, represent very small 
proportions of all small businesses. The 
following are the percentages of firms 
that were certified for H–2B workers 
among all small U.S. businesses in their 
respective industries: Landscaping 
Services, 2.2 percent [(2,754 × 0.50)/ 
63,210]; Janitorial Services, 0.9 percent 
[(788 × 0.50)/45,595]; Food Services and 
Drinking Places, 0.1 percent [(851 × 
0.50)/293,373]; Amusement, Gambling, 
and Recreation, 0.3 percent [(227 × 
0.50)/43,726], and Construction, 0.1 
percent [(860 × 0.50)/689,040].29 Due to 
the statutory annual cap on available 
visas, the percentage of small entities 
receiving H–2B visas, to which the full 
cost burden would apply, would be 
even lower. 
Therefore, the Department estimates 
that this proposed rule will have a net 
direct cost impact on a very limited 
number of small non-agricultural 
employers above the baseline of the 
current costs incurred by the program as 
it is currently implemented under the 
2008 Final Rule. Accordingly, the 
proposed rule is not expected to impact 
a substantial number of small entities. 
The Department specifically requests 
comments on these burden estimates, 
including the number of small entities 
affected by this proposed change in 
prevailing wage methodology, and on 
how the final rule can reduce burden on 
small entities while meeting the 
statutory requirement that the 
employment of H–2B workers not 
adversely affect the wages and working 
conditions of similarly employed U.S. 
workers. 
5. Identification of All Relevant Federal 
Rules That May Duplicate, Overlap or 
Conflict With the Proposed Rule 
The Department is not aware of any 
relevant Federal rules that duplicate, 
overlap or conflict with the proposed 
rule. 
6. Alternatives Considered as Options 
for Small Entities Businesses 
While the Department believes this 
proposed regulation would not impact a 
substantial number of small entities, we 
recognize the potential impact on small 
businesses and have considered 
alternatives to minimize such impacts. 
The Department’s mandate under the 
H–2B program is to set requirements for 
employers that wish to hire temporary 
foreign non-agricultural workers. Those 
requirements are designed to ensure that

foreign workers are used only if 
qualified domestic workers are not 
available and that the hiring of H–2B 
workers will not adversely affect the 
wages and working conditions of 
similarly employed domestic workers. 
These regulations set those minimum 
standards with regard to wages. The 
required wage rate is a critical aspect of 
the H–2B program that determines 
whether U.S. workers’ wages will be 
adversely affected by the admission of 
foreign workers. To create different and 
likely lower standards for one class of 
employers (e.g., small businesses) 
would essentially sanction the very 
adverse effect that the Department is 
compelled to prevent. 
The Department considered alternate 
data sources to determine prevailing 
wages, but given the time constraints 
imposed by the court’s order and the 
absence of available data, we were 
unable to fully analyze these 
alternatives. The only available sources 
of information that we are aware of for 
setting the prevailing wage are the OES, 
DBA/SCA, and surveys created by 
private entities. The NRPM discusses 
the agency’s proposal about how those 
sources should be used. It would be 
difficult, if not impossible, to cost out 
any alternative use of these sources. For 
example, to the Department’s 
knowledge there is no accessible data 
base of acceptable private surveys that 
would allow us to determine the cost 
implications of allowing their continued 
use. While the Department has been 
unable to fully analyze other viable 
options for the calculation of prevailing 
wages for small entities, the Department 
invites comments on the availability, 
usefulness and costs of other potential, 
reliable data sources. 
Ultimately the decision of an 
employer to apply for H–2B workers is 
a voluntary choice. That is, any 
individual employer can avoid the costs 
associated with the NPRM by not 
applying for H–2B workers. 
C. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531) 
directs agencies to assess the effects of 
Federal regulatory actions on State, 
local, and tribal governments, and the 
private sector. The proposed rule has no 
Federal mandate, which is defined in 
2 U.S.C. 658(6) to include either a 
‘‘Federal intergovernmental mandate’’ or 
a ‘‘Federal private sector mandate.’’ A 
Federal mandate is any provision in a 
regulation that imposes an enforceable 
duty upon State, local, or tribal 
governments, or imposes a duty upon 
the private sector which is not 
voluntary. A decision by a private entity 
to obtain an H–2B worker is purely 
voluntary and is, therefore, excluded 
from any reporting requirement under 
the Act. 
D. Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 
The Department has determined that 
this rulemaking does not impose a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities under the RFA; 
therefore, the Department is not 
required to produce any compliance 
guides for small entities as mandated by 
the SBREFA. The Department has, 
however, concluded that this proposed 
rule is a major rule requiring review by 
the Congress under the SBREFA because 
it will likely result in: (1) An annual 
effect on the economy of $100 million 
or more; (2) a major increase in costs or 
prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State or local 
Government agencies, or geographic 
regions; or (3) significant adverse effects 
on competition, employment, 
investment, productivity, innovation, or 
on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises 
to compete with foreign-based 
enterprises in domestic or export 
markets. 
E. Executive Order 13132—Federalism 
The Department has reviewed this 
proposed rule in accordance with E.O. 
13132 regarding federalism and has 
determined that it does not have 
federalism implications. The proposed 
rule does not have substantial direct 
effects on States, on the relationship 
between the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government as described by 
E.O. 13132. Therefore, the Department 
has determined that this proposed rule 
will not have a sufficient federalism 
implication to warrant the preparation 
of a summary impact statement. 
F. Executive Order 13175—Indian 
Tribal Governments 
This proposed rule was reviewed 
under the terms of E.O. 13175 and 
determined not to have tribal 
implications. The proposed rule does 
not have substantial direct effects on 
one or more Indian tribes, on the 
relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. As a 
result, no tribal summary impact 
statement has been prepared. 
G. Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families 
Section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus 
Consolidated and Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 
1999 (Pub. L. 105–277, 112 Stat. 2681) 
requires the Department to assess the 
impact of this proposed rule on family 
well-being. A rule that is determined to 
have a negative effect on families must 
be supported with an adequate 
rationale. 
The Department has assessed this 
proposed rule and determines that it 
will not have a negative effect on 
families. 
H. Executive Order 12630—Government 
Actions and Interference With 
Constitutionally Protected Property 
Rights 
The proposed rule is not subject to 
E.O. 12630, Governmental Actions and 
Interference with Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights, because it 
does not involve implementation of a 
policy with takings implications. 
I. Executive Order 12988—Civil Justice 
The proposed rule has been drafted 
and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 
12988, Civil Justice Reform, and will not 
unduly burden the Federal court 
system. The Department has developed 
the proposed rule to minimize litigation 
and provide a clear legal standard for 
affected conduct, and has reviewed the 
proposed rule carefully to eliminate 
drafting errors and ambiguities. 
J. Plain Language 
The Department drafted this NPRM in 
plain language. 
K. Paperwork Reduction Act 
As part of its continuing effort to 
reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, the Department conducts a 
preclearance consultation program to 
provide the general public and Federal 
agencies with an opportunity to 
comment on proposed and continuing 
collections of information in accordance 
with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). 
This process helps to ensure that the 
public understands the Department’s 
collection instructions; respondents 
provide requested data in the desired 
format; reporting burden (time and 
financial resources) is minimized; 
collection instruments are clearly 
understood; and the Department 
properly assesses the impact of 
collection requirements on respondents. 
The PRA requires all Federal agencies 
to analyze proposed regulations for

potential time burdens on the regulated 
community created by provisions 
within the proposed regulations that 
require the submission of information. 
These information collection (IC) 
requirements must be submitted to the 
OMB for approval. Persons are not 
required to respond to a collection of 
information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number as 
required in 5 CFR 1320.11(l) or it is 
exempt from the PRA. 
The majority of the IC requirements 
for the current H–2B program are 
approved under OMB control number 
1205–0466 (which includes ETA Form 
9141 and ETA Form 9142). There are no 
burden adjustments that need to be 
made to the analysis. For an additional 
explanation of how the Department 
calculated the burden hours and related 
costs, the PRA package for information 
collection OMB control number 1205– 
0466 may be obtained by contacting the 
PRA addressee shown below or at
