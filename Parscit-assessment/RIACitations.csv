Inspectors from the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) inspect the viscera and carcass and, for older birds, the heads using a sequence of observations and palpations at a postmortem inspection station. The streamlined inspection system (SIS) and:the new line speed inspection system (NELS) are the most prevalent visual inspection methods. The former has a line speed of 70 birds/min with two inspectors per line, and the latter has a line speed of 91 birds/min requiring three inspectors per line. Both inspection methods are labor intensive and prone to human error. In addition, the speed of the slaughter line is dictated by the number of birds per minute that can be inspected by FSIS inspectors. Ninety-one birds/min is currently the maximum visual inspection Line speed allowed under current Federal regulations. This study evaluates the economic benefits of using automated inspection in place of visual inspection from the perspective of both the slaughter plant and FSIS. The results indicate that FSIS and slaughter plants would gain economic benefits by using automated inspection in place of visual inspection. The economic benefits to FSIS would accrue from labor savings, whereas the economic benefits to slaughter plants would accrue primarily from increased throughput from faster inspection line speeds.",Scholarly Journal,0583-AD36,,17,"From Quality of Life Assessment: Key Issues in the 1990s",Kluwer Academic Publishers,,"Kaplan, Robert M., J.

We used the conceptual framework of O'Brien and Gafni (1996) to classify and critically appraise health care CVM studies.Methods: Search of computerized health care and economic citation databases (e.g. MEDLINE, ECONLIT) and manual search for papers published between 1984–1996 reporting primary data valuing health programme benefits in monetary units by CVM using willingness-to-pay (WTP) or accept (WTA). We classified studies using both empirical (i.e. who was surveyed and how) and conceptual criteria (i.e. which measure of consumer utility was measured and why).Results: 48 CVM studies were retrieved; the majority (42) undertook money valuation in the context of cost benefit analysis (CBA), with the remainder being pricing/demand studies. Among the 42 CBA studies, the consumer utility being measured (i.e. compensating (CV) vs. equivalent variation (EV) was explicitly stated in only three (7%) studies). WTP was measured in 95% of studies and WTA in 5%. By cross-tabulation, 42 (91%) studies were designed as WTP/CV, two (4%) were WTP/EV, two (4%) were WTA/CV and no studies used WTA/EV. Most studies were administered by mail (52%) with 38% being in-person interviews. Value elicitation techniques included open-ended questions (38%), payment cards (19%) discrete choice questions (26%) or bidding games (29%). Some form of construct validation tests, particularly associations between WTP and income, were done in 21 studies (50%).Conclusions: (i) The number of health care CVM studies is growing rapidly and the majority are done in the context of CBA; (ii) there is wide variation among health care CVM studies in terms of the types of questions being posed and the elicitation formats being used; (iii) classification and appraisal of the literature is difficult because reporting of methods and their relationship with the conceptual framework of CBA is poor; (iii) the applicability to health care of the CVM guidelines issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) panel for environmental economics is unclear. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Scholarly Journal0583-AD36,,17,Microbiology of Aquaculture Products,Food Technology,0015-6639,"Ward, D",,1989,North Carolina State University,,,Scholarly Journal0583-AD36,,17,Occurrence and Control of Salmonella in Freshwater Catfish,"Journal of Food Science.

Five years following the food poisoning, a mail and telephone survey was carried out to determine all those who developed ReA within 3 months of the onset of dysentery. Medical and physiotherapy charts from an earlier study on the same cohort were incorporated. All patients with a history compatible with reactive arthritis were interviewed and examined. Serum was taken to determine the presence of isotypic antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide of the causative Salmonella typhimurium. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 423 individuals with dysentery were identified as developing acute ReA. In one third of them, the arthritis resolved within 4 months of onset. Two thirds continued to have subjective complaints, mostly of minor significance. However, symptoms were severe enough to force a change in work for 4 patients. Another 4 patients had objective damage to joints radiographically. Objective changes to joints were documented on physical examination in 37% of ReA patients 5 years following onset of disease. IgA antilipopolysaccharide antibodies correlated with the severity and duration of disease. Tests of cellular immune function did not correlate with clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic symptoms persist 5 years after the onset of ReA in the majority of patients. Joint damage by physical examination and radiographic assessment correlate with functional disability. Some early clinical features of disease, including prolonged diarrhea during the acute illness, may predict a worse outcome. IgA antilipopolysaccharides may serve as a disease marker for late post-Salmonella-infection ReA.",Scholarly Journal0583-AD36,,17,Salmonella Cost Estimate Updated Using FoodNet Data,"FoodReview, (22) 2: pp.10-15",,"Frenzen, P.

Design.-Systems analysis of events from a prospective cohort study. Participants.-All admissions to 11 medical and surgical units in two tertiary care hospitals over a 6-month period. Main Outcome Measures.-Errors, proximal causes, and systems failures. Methods.-Errors were detected by interviews of those involved. Errors were classified according to proximal cause and underlying systems failure by multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and systems analysts. Results.-During this period, 334 errors were detected as the causes of 264 preventable ADEs and potential ADEs. Sixteen major systems failures were identified as the underlying causes of the errors. The most common systems failure was in the dissemination of drug knowledge, particularly to physicians, accounting for 29% of the 334 errors. Inadequate availability of patient information, such as the results of laboratory tests, was associated with 18% of errors. Seven systems failures accounted for 78% of the errors; all could be improved by better information systems. Conclusions.-Hospital personnel willingly participated in the detection and investigation of drug use errors and were able to identify underlying systems failures. The most common defects were in systems to disseminate knowledge about drugs and to make drug and patient information readily accessible at the time it is needed. Systems changes to improve dissemination and display of drug and patient data should make errors in the use of drugs less likely.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG31,,12,Surveillance of medical device-related hazards and adverse events in hospitalized patients,Journal of the American Medical Association,0098-7484,"Samore, MH; Evans, RS; Lassen, A; Gould, P; Lloyd, J; Gardner, RM; Abouzelof, R; Taylor, C; Woodbury, DA; Willy, M; Bright, RA",10.1001/jama.291.3.325,4-Jan,University of Utah School of Medicine; LDS Hospital/Intermountain Health Care; Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System; Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; Food and Drug Administration,"Office of Women's Health and Office of Surveillance and Biometrics, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration","Abstract: Context Although adverse drug events have been extensively evaluated by computer-based surveillance, medical device errors have no comparable surveillance techniques. Objectives To determine whether computer-based surveillance can reliably identify medical device-related hazards (no known harm to patient) and adverse medical device events (AMDEs; patient experienced harm) and to compare alternative methods of detection of device-related problems. Design, Setting, and Participants This descriptive study was conducted from January through September 2000 at a 520-bed tertiary teaching institution in the United States with experience in using computer tools to detect and prevent adverse drug events. All 20441 regular and short-stay patients (excluding obstetric and newborn patients) were included. Main Outcome Measures Medical device events as detected by computer-based flags, telemetry problem checklists, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge code (which could include AMDEs present at admission), clinical engineering work logs, and patient survey results were compared with each other and with routine voluntary incident reports to determine frequencies, proportions, positive predictive values, and incidence rates by each technique. Results Of the 7059 flags triggered, 552 (7.8%) indicate a device-related hazard or AMDE. The estimated 9-month incidence rates (number per 1000 admissions [95% confidence intervals]) for AMDEs were 1.6 (0.9-2.5) for incident reports, 27.7 (24.9-30.7) for computer flags, and 64.6 (60.4-69.1) for ICD-9 discharge codes. Few of these events were detected by more than 1 surveillance method, giving an overall incidence of AMDE detected by at least 1 of these methods of 83.7 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 78.8-88.6) admissions. The positive predictive value of computer flags for detecting device-related hazards and AMDEs ranged from 0% to 38%. Conclusions More intensive surveillance methods yielded higher rates of medical device problems than found with traditional voluntary reporting, with little overlap between methods. Several detection methods had low efficiency in detecting AMDEs. The high rite of AMDEs suggests that AMDEs are an important patient safety issue, but additional research is necessary to identify optimal AMIDE detection strategies.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG31,,12,Estimates of medical device-associated adverse events from emergency departments,American Journal of Preventative Medicine,0749-3797,"Hefflin, BJ; Gross, TP; Schroeder, TJ",10.1016/j.amepre.2004.04.005,4-Oct,US Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health; US Consumer Product Safety Commission,,"Abstract: Background: The true public health burden of adverse events associated with medical devices is unknown. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to produce the first-ever national estimates of medical device-associated adverse events resulting in emergency department (ED) visits. Methods: From July 1999 through June 2000, reports of 10,395 medical device-associated adverse events were accumulated using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), which collects information on product-related injuries from the ED records of a national stratified probability sample of hospitals. The reports were used to estimate annual total number of medical device-associated adverse events as well as number of adverse events associated with specific devices, injury diagnoses, demographic characteristics, and patient disposition status. Results: The total estimated number of adverse events was 454,383 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 371,156-537,610), involving a broad range of devices from 15 medical specialty groups. Unintentional traumatic events associated with a particular device appeared to be the most common mechanism of injury. The most prevalent types of injuries included contusions/abrasions, punctures, and lacerations; 13% of total estimated cases resulted in patient hospitalization. Adverse events occurred within healthcare facilities, and some were occupationally related, although they occurred at home more frequently than any other location (about 42%). Conclusions: The magnitude of the total estimate, which is over four times greater than the annual number of adverse event reports received by medical device-regulating surveillance systems, emphasizes medical device-associated adverse events as an under-recognized public health problem. Planned collection of more detailed NEISS data will allow for appropriate public health interventions.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,"Smokings continues gradual decline among U.S. Teens, smokeless tobacco threatens a comeback",University of Michigan News Service,,,,14-Dec-09,,,,Article ,Available at http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/data/09data.html#2009data-cigs0910-AG41,,2,The Economics of Smoking,"in ’’ Handbook of Health Economics"" by Chaloupka, F., and Warner, K",,,,2000,,,,Book,Publisher: Newhouse0910-AG41,,2,The Price of Smoking,"Sloan, F.A., Ostermann, J., and Conover, C., et al.",,,,2004,,,,Book,Cambridge MA: MIT Press (2004).0910-AG41,,2,2006 Annual Survey of Manufacturers,U.S. Census Bureau,,,,,,,,Database,American FactFinder0910-AG41,,2,Global Agricultural Trade System Online,".S Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service",,,,,,,,Database,Available at http://www.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx0910-AG41,,2,"), Latest SUSB Annual Data, U.S., All Industries","U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses ",,,,2007,,,,Government Report ,Available at http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/0910-AG41,,2,‘‘Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Graphic Health Warnings on Tobacco Product Packaging 2008,Canberra: Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing,,,,2009,,,,Government Report ,0910-AG41,,2,"2002 Economic Census, Accommodation and Food Services, Subject Series",U.S. Census Bureau,,,,2005,,,,Government Report ,Available at http://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0272sllst.pdf0910-AG41,,2,"2002 Economic Census, Retail Trade, Subject Series",U.S. Census Bureau,,,,2005,,,,Government Report ,Available at http://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0244sllst.pdf0910-AG41,,2,"2007 Census of Agriculture: United States Summary and State Data: Volume 1, Geographic Area Series, Part 51",U.S. Department of Agriculture,,,,9-Dec,,,,Government Report ,Available at http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Full_Report/usv1.pdf0910-AG41,,2,Age of smoking initiation: implications for quitting,"Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada ",,,,1998,,,,Government Report ,"Health Reports (Statistics Canada, Catalogue 82– 003–XPB), 9(4); 39–46, 1998.

Wynder, EL",10.1056/NEJM199109263251318,26-Sep-91,American Health Foundation,American Cancer Society; National Cancer Society," The age at which a person begins to smoke cigarettes has been found to be related to the total number of years of subsequent smoking1 2 3 4; however, the possible association of this factor with other smoking-related variables has not been examined. We studied the relation between the age at which a person starts smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day in adulthood.Since 1969, the American Health Foundation has conducted a hospital-based case–control study to investigate tobacco-related cancers. A standardized questionnaire was administered to patients with cancer and matched control subjects by trained interviewers to collect a history of smoking and information on demographic and anthropometric variables.For the purposes of this analysis, the cases and controls were grouped together; the results for a total of 30,174 men and 11,828 women were analyzed. As expected, the age when smoking began was related to the total number of years of smoking in both sexes. A relation was found for each sex between the age when smoking began and the number of cigarettes smoked per day in adulthood (Fig. 1Figure 1Relation between the Age at the Start of Smoking and the Number of Cigarettes Smoked per Day in Adulthood, According to Sex.). Among men who began to smoke at or before the age of 14 years, 19.6 percent smoked 41 or more cigarettes per day in adulthood, as compared with 10.3 percent of those who started smoking when they were 20 or older (P<0.001). Among women, 26.9 percent of those who started smoking at or before the age of 16 smoked 31 or more cigarettes per day in adulthood, as compared with 15.4 percent of those who started at the age of 20 or older (P<0.001).Since starting to smoke at an early age increases the number of cigarettes smoked per day in adult life, it is likely to enhance the risk of tobacco-related diseases. Although the primary preventive goal should be to achieve a smoke-free environment, the finding of an association between early age at the start of smoking and heavy subsequent cigarette consumption suggests that additional efforts should be made to postpone the beginning of smoking among youngsters.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,"Response of mass media, tobacco industry and smokers to the introduction of graphic cigarette pack warnings in Australia",European Journal of Public Health,1101-1262,"Miller, CL; Hill, DJ; Quester, PG; Hiller, JE",10.1093/eurpub/ckp089,9-Dec,"Cancer Council South Australia, South Australia, Australia; University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; The Cancer Council Victoria, Victoria, Australia",Cancer Council of South Australia; Cancer Council Victoria,"Background: In the year 2006, Australia introduced graphic cigarette packet warnings. Previous warnings were text only. New warnings include one of 14 pictures, many depicting tobacco-related pathology. Methods: This study monitored the roll-out of the health policy initiative using multiple methodologies. Print media coverage of new pack warnings was observed over 3 years. Story content was coded as positive (supportive of pack warnings), neutral or negative. An observational study of small random sample of metropolitan stores (n = 16) over 7 months measured the pace of the roll-out in shops. Once new packs were readily available in stores, smokers (n = 152) were intercepted in city streets and asked about their reactions. Results: Of the 67 media stories, 85% were positive or neutral about the new warnings and 15% were negative. Supportive content presented health benefits. Unsupportive content presented industry arguments. After the legislative change, it took 2 months before any new packs appeared in stores. After 6 months, the majority carried them. Newest images had highest recall among smokers. About 60% said new warnings detracted from the look of their brand. About 51% felt the increased risk of dying from smoking-related illness. About 38% felt motivated to quit. Conclusion: Plans by government to introduce graphic warnings were delayed up to 2 years, apparently by heavy industry lobbying. Actual widespread appearance in shops occurred several months after the implementation date. While media coverage of the new warnings reported the industry arguments against them, the balance of coverage was overwhelmingly positive. Smokers' initial reactions were in line with tobacco control objectives.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,The Surgeon General's Warnings in Outdoor Cigarette Advertising- Are they Readable,Journal of the American Medical Association,0098-7484,"Davis, RM; Kendrick, JS",10.1001/jama.261.1.90,6-Jan-89,Centers for Disease Control,Centers for Disease Control,"Outdoor advertising media represent a major vehicle by which cigarette companies promote their products. We investigated the readability of the Surgeon General's warning in cigarette advertisements (ads) in two outdoor media: billboards and taxicab ads. In an experiment in metropolitan Atlanta under typical driving conditions, observers were able to read the entire health warning on 18 (46%) of 39 street billboards but on only two (5%) of 39 highway billboards. In contrast, the content of the ads (ie, brand name, other wording, and notable imagery) could be recognized under the same conditions on more than 95% of the billboards. In a similar study of 100 taxicab cigarette ads in New York City, observers were unable to read the health warning in any of the ads but were able to identify the brand name in all ads and notable imagery in 95% of the ads. Significant differences between the readability of the warning and identification of the advertising content persisted even when partially read warnings were considered to have been read. We conclude that the Surgeon General's warning is not readable in its current form in the vast majority of billboard and taxicab ads. Factors contributing to unreadability include the small size of the letters, the excessive length of the warnings, the distance between the viewers and the ads, and movement between the viewers and the ads.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,Young Adults’ Perceptions of Cigarette Warning Labels in the United States and Canada,Preventing Chronic Disease,1545-1151,"O'Hegarty, M; Pederson, LL; Yenokyan, G; Nelson, D; Wortley, P",,2007,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Johns Hopkins University,,"INTRODUCTION:For the past 20 years, there have been no changes to the text-only cigarette warning labels in the United States. During this same time period, other countries placed large graphic warning labels on cigarette packages. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reactions of U.S. young adult smokers and nonsmokers aged 18 to 24 years to Canadian cigarette label text and graphic warnings. The study focused on determining their perceptions and the potential impact of Canadian labels on smoking, and study participants were asked for suggestions for modifications of U.S. cigarette warning labels so they would be effective for smoking deterrence and cessation.METHODS:During January and February 2002, 11 focus groups consisting of 54 smokers and 41 nonsmokers were conducted in the Detroit metropolitan area. Current smokers were defined as those who had smoked a cigarette within the past 30 days. Participants were asked about their knowledge and perceptions of current U.S. cigarette warning labels and their impressions of Canadian cigarette warning labels.ANALYSIS:A content analysis and a word index were applied to the transcripts of all focus groups to identify and clarify themes and domains that appeared in group discussions and to compare results across different groups.RESULTS:Focus group participants reported that Canadian cigarette warning labels were more visible and informative than U.S. cigarette warning labels. Messages perceived to be relevant to smokers were considered effective. Education level did not appear related to how participants responded to warning labels. There were some differences for warning labels that had sex-specific messages.DISCUSSION:Warning labels are one component of comprehensive tobacco control and smoking cessation efforts. Stronger warnings on cigarette packages need to be part of a larger U.S. public health educational effort.",Scholarly Journal,Could not Find DOI 0910-AG41,,2,Do graphic health warning labels  have an impact on adolescents' smoking-related beliefs and behaviours?,Addiction,0965-2140,"White, V; Webster, B; Wakefield, M",10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02294.x,8-Sep,"Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, The Cancer Council Victoria, Victoria, Australia",Cancer Council Victoria; Winifred and John Webster charitable trust,"Aims To assess the impact of the introduction of graphic health warning labels on cigarette packets on adolescents at different smoking uptake stages. Design School-based surveys conducted in the year prior to (2005) and approximately 6 months after (2006) the introduction of the graphic health warnings. The 2006 survey was conducted after a TV advertising campaign promoting two new health warnings. Setting Secondary schools in greater metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Participants Students in year levels 8-12: 2432 students in 2005, and 2050 in 2006, participated. Measures Smoking uptake stage, intention to smoke, reported exposure to cigarette packs, knowledge of health effects of smoking, cognitive processing of warning labels and perceptions of cigarette pack image. Findings At baseline, 72% of students had seen cigarette packs in the previous 6 months, while at follow-up 77% had seen packs and 88% of these had seen the new warning labels. Cognitive processing of warning labels increased, with students more frequently reading, attending to, thinking and talking about warning labels at follow-up. Experimental and established smokers thought about quitting and forgoing cigarettes more at follow-up. At follow-up intention to smoke was lower among those students who had talked about the warning labels and had forgone cigarettes. Conclusions Graphic warning labels on cigarette packs are noticed by the majority of adolescents, increase adolescents' cognitive processing of these messages and have the potential to lower smoking intentions. Our findings suggest that the introduction of graphic warning labels may help to reduce smoking among adolescents.",scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,Benefits of smoking cessation for longevity,American Journal of Public Health,0090-0036,"Taylor, DH; Hasselblad, V; Henley, SJ; Thun, MJ; Sloan, FA",10.2105/AJPH.92.6.990,2-Jun,Duke University; American Cancer Society,National Institute on Aging,"Objectives. This study determined the life extension obtained from stopping smoking at various ages.Methods. We estimated the relation between smoking and mortality among 877243 respondents to the Cancer Prevention Study II. These estimates were applied to the 1990 US census population to examine the longevity benefits of smoking cessation.Results. Life expectancy among smokers who quit at age 35 exceeded that of continuing smokers by 6.9 to 8.5 years for men and 6.1 to 7.7 years for women. Smokers who quit at younger ages realized greater life extensions. However, even those who quit much later in life gained some benefits: among smokers who quit at age 65 years, men gained 1.4 to 2.0 years of life, and women gained 2.7 to 3.7 years.Conclusions, Stopping smoking as early as possible is important, but cessation at any age provides meaningful life extensions.

Thus, the current study investigated failure to report quit attempts as a function of length of quit attempt by time since quit attempt over the past year. Methods: The present study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a series of population-based surveys of smokers and recent ex-smokers in England aged 16 years and older. Among the 11,772 smokers identified at baseline (24.4% of the total sample), this study focused on the 4234 participants (36.0% of current smokers) who reported between one and three quit attempts in the past year. Results: There was a strong trend for quit attempts that lasted for shorter periods of time to fail to be reported. After three months, 90.1% of those lasting less than one day, 63.7% of those lasting between a day a one week, and 38.9% of those lasting between one week and one month failed to be reported. Conclusion:A large proportion of unsuccessful quit attempts fail to be reported, particularly if they only last a short time or occurred longer ago. Therefore, population estimates of quit attempts based on retrospective data may be considerable underestimates and estimates of the success of quit attempts may be overestimates.

Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight-obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol use; and tobacco smoking.Methods and Findings: We used data on risk factor exposures in the US population from nationally representative health surveys and disease-specific mortality statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained the etiological effects of risk factors on disease-specific mortality, by age, from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted (i) for major potential confounders, and (ii) where possible for regression dilution bias. We estimated the number of disease-specific deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and sex. In 2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 436,000-500,000) and 395,000 (372,000-414,000) deaths, accounting for about one in five or six deaths in US adults. Overweight-obesity (216,000; 188,000-237,000) and physical inactivity (191,000; 164,000-222,000) were each responsible for nearly 1 in 10 deaths. High dietary salt (102,000; 97,000-107,000), low dietary omega-3 fatty acids (84,000; 72,000-96,000), and high dietary trans fatty acids (82,000; 63,000-97,000) were the dietary risks with the largest mortality effects. Although 26,000 (23,000-40,000) deaths from ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes were averted by current alcohol use, they were outweighed by 90,000 (88,000-94,000) deaths from other cardiovascular diseases, cancers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, alcohol use disorders, road traffic and other injuries, and violence.Conclusions: Smoking and high blood pressure, which both have effective interventions, are responsible for the largest number of deaths in the US. Other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors for chronic diseases also cause a substantial number of deaths in the US.

At first the war on cancer went poorly: despite a substantial increase in resources, age-adjusted cancer mortality increased by 8 percent between 1971 and 1990, twice the increase from 1950 through 1971. However, between 1990 and 2004, age-adjusted cancer mortality fell by 13 percent. This drop translates into an increase in life expectancy at birth of half a year--roughly a quarter of the two-year increase in life expectancy over this time period and a third of the increase in life expectancy at age 45. The decline brings cancer mortality to its lowest level in 60 years. In the war on cancer, optimism has replaced pessimism. In this paper, I evaluate the reasons for the reduction in cancer mortality. I highlight three factors as leading to improved survival. Most important is cancer screening: mammography for breast cancer and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer. These technologies have had the largest impact on survival, at relatively moderate cost. Second in importance are personal behaviors, especially the reduction in smoking. Tobacco-related mortality reduction is among the major factors associated with better health, likely at a cost worth paying. Third in importance, and more controversial, are treatment changes. Improvements in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have contributed to improved survival for a number of cancers, but at high cost. The major challenge for cancer care in the future is likely to be the balancing act between what we are able to do and what it makes sense to pay for.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,Smoking cessation in young adults: Age at initiation of cigarette smoking and other suspected influences,American Journal of Public Health,0090-0036,"Breslau, N; Peterson, EL",10.2105/AJPH.86.2.214,Feb-96,Henry Ford Health Sciences Center; University of Michigan; Case Western Reserve University,National Institute of Mental Health,"Objectives. Previous research has suggested that early smoking initiation predicts longer duration of smoking, heavier daily consumption, and increased chances of nicotine dependence. This report set out to estimate the relationship between smoking cessation and age of initiation, as well as nicotine dependence. sex, race, and education.Methods. A sample of 1007 young adults was randomly selected from a large health maintenance organization in southeast Michigan. Hazard ratios of quitting associated with age at smoking initiation were estimated among 414 persons who smoked daily for 1 month or more.Results. With potential confounders controlled for, the likelihood of cessation was significantly higher in smokers who initiated smoking after age 13. The hazard ratio for quitting associated with smoking initiation at ages 14 to 16 was 1.6 and with initiation at or after age 17 was 2.0, compared with initiation at or before 13 years of age. Factors that decreased the likelihood of cessation were nicotine dependence and low education.Conclusions. Public policy to discourage early smoking, if it succeeds in delaying the initiation of smoking, might contribute to the reduction of smoking-related mortality and morbidity by increasing the potential for quitting.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,Recall and eye tracking study of adolescents viewing tobacco advertisements,Journal of American Medical Association,0098-7484 ,"Fischer, PM; Richards, JW; Berman, EJ; Krugman, DM",10.1001/jama.261.1.84,6-Jan-89,Medical College of Georgia; University of Georgia,Doctors Ought to Care,"The warning on tobacco advertisements was required by the federal government, presumably as a health message to educate the public about the risks associated with tobacco use.

The present study used well-accepted market research methods to examine adolescent viewing of tobacco advertisements. Sixty-one adolescents participated in the study. Eye tracking was used to study how participants viewed five different tobacco advertisements. The average viewing time of the warning amounted to only 8% of the total advertisement viewing time. In 43.6% of cases, the warning was not viewed at all. Following the advertisement viewing, participants were asked to identify the observed warnings within a list that included other simulated warnings.

Other countries, such as Canada, have taken a more active and aggressive approach. The purpose of this study was to examine how U.S. smokers and former smokers might respond to stronger and more graphic warnings for U.S. cigarettes packages.Methods: Data were collected in 2003 and analyzed in 2004. The perceived impact and effectiveness of the more-explicit Canadian labels was examined among young adult smokers (n=572) and former smokers (n=191) between the ages of 18 and 24 years in the United States, using a web-based survey that allowed participants to view both the text-only and the text-plus-graphic warning labels.Results: Both current and former smokers thought that cigarette warning labels with text plus graphics were substantially more of a deterrent than text-only labels. The perceived effectiveness of these labels was not only higher overall, but also for the specific areas of smoking-related health effects, prevention, cessation, and maintenance of abstinence. Few differences were noted by gender.Conclusions: The findings from this study support previous research that has found that text-plus-graphic warning labels are more salient and potentially more effective than text-only labels.

Students from 2 of the schools (n=803) were observed for approximately 3 months.Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported knowledge of warning labels was assessed at baseline. Self-reports of smoking behavior were completed at baseline and at follow-up.Results: Greater knowledge of cigarette package warning labels was significantly associated with higher levels of smoking. Knowledge of warning labels on magazine and billboard advertisements did not differ significantly by level of smoking. In the longitudinal sample, greater knowledge of cigarette package warning labels was significantly associated with a subsequent increase in smoking, controlling for the baseline level of smoking, sex, ethnicity, and knowledge of warning labels on cigarette advertisements (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.46). Knowledge of warning labels on cigarette advertisements was not associated with a significant change in smoking behavior (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.82-1.35).Conclusions: Sizable proportions of adolescent smokers are not seeing, reading, or remembering cigarette warning labels. In addition, knowledge of warning labels on cigarette packages and advertisements is not associated with reduced smoking. The current warning labels are ineffective among adolescents.

However, few studies have evaluated the impact of package warnings on consumer knowledge about tobacco risks.Objective: The aim of the current study was to use nationally representative samples of adult smokers from the United States ( USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada (CAN), and Australia (AUS) from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4) to examine variations in smokers' knowledge about tobacco risks and the impact of package warnings.Methods: A telephone survey was conducted with 9058 adult smokers from the following countries: USA (n = 2138), UK (n = 2401), CAN (n = 2214) and AUS (n = 2305). Respondents were asked to state whether they believed smoking caused heart disease, stroke, impotence, lung cancer in smokers, and lung cancer in non-smokers. Respondents were also asked whether the following chemicals are found in cigarette smoke: cyanide, arsenic and carbon monoxide.Findings: Smokers in the four countries exhibited significant gaps in their knowledge of the risks of smoking. Smokers who noticed the warnings were significantly more likely to endorse health risks, including lung cancer and heart disease. In each instance where labelling policies differed between countries, smokers living in countries with government mandated warnings reported greater health knowledge. For example, in Canada, where package warnings include information about the risks of impotence, smokers were 2.68 (2.41 - 2.97) times more likely to agree that smoking causes impotence compared to smokers from the other three countries.Conclusion: Smokers are not fully informed about the risks of smoking. Warnings that are graphic, larger, and more comprehensive in content are more effective in communicating the health risks of smoking.

Measures were of pack warning salience (reading and noticing); cognitive responses (thoughts of harm and quitting); and two behavioural responses: forgoing cigarettes and avoiding the warnings.Results: All four indicators of impact increased markedly among Australian smokers following the introduction of graphic warnings. Controlling for date of introduction, they stimulated more cognitive responses than the UK (text-only) changes, and were avoided more, did not significantly increase forgoing cigarettes, but were read and noticed less. The findings also extend previous work showing partial wear-out of both graphic and text-only warnings, but the Canadian warnings have more sustained effects than UK ones.Conclusions: Australia's new health warnings increased reactions that are prospectively predictive of cessation activity. Warning size increases warning effectiveness and graphic warnings may be superior to text-based warnings. While there is partial wear-out in the initial impact associated with all warnings, stronger warnings tend to sustain their effects for longer. These findings support arguments for governments to exceed minimum FCTC requirements on warnings.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,The value of health and longevity,Journal of Political Economy,0022-3808,"Murphy, KM; Topel, RH",10.1086/508033,8-Oct,University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,Milken Foundation; Lasker Charitable Trust,"We develop a framework for valuing improvements in health and apply it to past and prospective reductions in mortality in the United States.

The Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine has called for an ""off-the-shelf"" catalogue of nationally representative, community-based preference scores for health states, illnesses, and conditions. A previous review of cost-effectiveness analyses found that 77% did not incorporate community-based preferences, and 33% used arbitrary expert or author judgment. These results highlight the necessity of making a wide array of appropriate, community-based estimates more accessible to cost-effectiveness researchers. Objective, To provide nationally representative EQ-5D index scores for chronic ICD-9 codes. Methods. The nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was pooled (2000-2002) to create a data set of 38,678 adults. Ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression methods were used to estimate the marginal disutility of each condition, controlling for age, comorbidity, gender, race, ethnicity, income, and education. Results. Most chronic conditions, age, comorbidity, income, and education were highly statistically significant predictors of EQ-5D index scores. Homoskedasticity and normality assumptions were rejected, suggesting only CLAD estimates are theoretically unbiased. The magnitude and statistical significance of coefficients varied by analytic method. OLS and Tobit coefficients were on average 60% and 143% greater than CLAD, respectively The marginal disutility of 95 chronic ICD-9 codes as well as unadjusted mean, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles are reported. Conclusion. This research provides nationally representative, community-based EQ-5D index scores associated with a wide variety of chronic ICD-9 codes that can be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years in cost-effectiveness analyses.

However, little is known about its effectiveness among adolescents. With this above in mind, we aimed to research into how adolescents perceive the proposed EU graphic tobacco product warning labels as an effective means of preventing smoking initiation in comparison to the current EU text-only warning labels. Methods: Five hundred seventy four adolescents (1318, 54 male) from Greece were privately interviewed, with the use of a digital questionnaire and randomly shown seven existing EU text-only and proposed EU graphic warning labels. Non-smoking respondents were asked to compare and rate the warnings effectiveness in regard to preventing them from smoking on a 15 Likert type scale. Results: Irrespective of the warning category shown, on all occasions, non-smoking adolescents rated the suggested EU graphic labels as more effective in preventing them from smoking in comparison to the existing EU text-only warnings. Controlling for gender, age, current smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per month, younger adolescents were found to opt for graphic warnings more often, and also perceive graphic warning labels as a more effective means of preventing them from smoking, in comparison to their elder peers (P 0.001). Conclusions: The proposed EU graphic warning labels may play an important role in preventing of smoking initiation during the crucial years of early adolescence when smoking experimentation and early addiction usually take place.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG41,,2,Estimating the impact of different cigarette package warning label policies: The auction method ,Addictive Behaviors,0306-4603,"Thrasher, JF; Rousu, MC; Anaya-Ocampo, R; Reynales-Shigematsu, LM; Anillo-Santillan, E; Hernandez-Avila, M",10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.05.018,7-Dec,"University of Illinois, Chicago; National Institute of Public Health; University of South Carolina; Susquehanna University",,"The study estimated the reduction in demand associated with implementing cigarette package warning labels that contain imagery illustrating the consequences of smoking.

Differences in the values attributed to each pack were assessed using t-tests and multivariate regression. The pack with the graphic image had a mean attributed value which was 17% lower (S3.21 pesos) than the pack with the text-only warning, and this difference remained statistically significant within subgroups defined by sociodemographics, amount of smoking, number of quit attempts, and levels of perceived smoking risks. In the multivariate model, the difference in attributed values was greater among females than males, but no such differences were found for other sociodemographic or smoking-related variables.

Collectively, however, the 8 nontobacco regions would have gained enough employment to completely offset losses in the Southeast Tobacco region, with every nontobacco region gaining jobs. By the year 2000, the absence of tobacco spending would mean a loss of 222 000 jobs in the Southeast Tobacco region, but a gain of 355 000 throughout the rest of the country. In the more realistic scenario of doubling the downward trend in tobacco consumption, the Southeast Tobacco region would lose 6300 jobs in 1993 (0.03% of regional employment) and 36 600 jobs by 2000 (0.2%). The 8 nontobacco regions would gain 6400 jobs in 1993 and 56 300 jobs in 2000, with each of the nontobacco regions gaining employment in every year.Conclusions.-Contrary to the tobacco industry's claims, reductions in spending on tobacco products will boost employment in every one of the 8 nontobacco regions and will not diminish employment in the Southeast Tobacco region by as much as the industry estimates.

However, warnings vary considerably among countries, ranging from graphic depictions of disease on Canadian packages to obscure text warnings in the United States. The current study examined the effectiveness of health warnings on cigarette packages in four countries.Methods: Quasi-experimental design. Telephone surveys were conducted with representative cohorts of adult smokers (n=14,975): Canada (n=3687), United States (n=4273), UK (n=3634), and Australia (n=3381). Surveys were conducted between 2002 and 2005, before and at three time points following implementation of new package warnings in the UK.Results: At Wave 1, Canadian smokers reported the highest levels of awareness and impact for health warnings among the four countries, followed by Australian smokers. Following the implementation of new UK warnings at Wave 2, UK smokers reported greater levels of awareness and impact, although Canadian smokers continued to report higher levels of impact after adjusting for the implementation date. U.S. smokers reported the lowest levels of effectiveness for almost every measure recorded at each survey wave.Conclusions: Large, comprehensive warnings on cigarette packages are more likely to be noticed and rated as effective by smokers. Changes in health warnings are also associated with increased effectiveness. Health warnings on U.S. packages, which were last updated in 1984, were associated with the least effectiveness.

A strong positive relation was observed between a measure of cognitive processing-the extent to which smokers reported reading, thinking about, and discussing the new labels-and smokers' intentions to quit (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.07 to 1. 16; p < 0.001). Most important, cognitive processing predicted cessation behaviour at follow up. Smokers who had read, thought about, and discussed the new labels at baseline were more likely to have quit, made a quit attempt, or reduced their smoking three months later, after adjusting for intentions to quit and smoking status at baseline (OR 1.07, 95% Cl 1.03 to 1. 12; p < 0.001).Conclusions: Graphic cigarette warning labels serve as an effective population based smoking cessation intervention.

The present study examined the extent to which former smokers' motivation to quit was influenced by two tobacco control policies recently introduced in the Waterloo Region: a local smoke-free bylaw and graphic cigarette warning labels.Methods: A random digit-dial telephone survey was conducted with 191 former smokers in southwestern Ontario, Canada in October 2001. Former smokers who had quit in the previous three years rated the factors that influenced their decision to quit and helped them to remain abstinent.Results: Thirty-six percent of former smokers cited smoke-free policies as a motivation to quit smoking. Former smokers who quit following the introduction of a total smoke-free bylaw were 3.06 (CI95 = 1.02-9.19) times more likely to cite smoking bylaws as a motivation to quit, compared to former smokers who quit prior to the bylaw. A total of 31% participants also reported that cigarette warning labels had motivated them to quit. Former smokers who quit following the introduction of the new graphic warning labels were 2.78 (CI95 = 1.20-5.94) times more likely to cite the warnings as a quitting influence than former smokers who quit prior to their introduction. Finally, 38% of all former smokers surveyed reported that smoke-free policies helped them remain abstinent and 27% reported that warning labels helped them do so.Conclusion: More stringent smoke-free and labelling policies were associated with a greater impact upon motivations to quit.",Scholarly Journal,Could  not find DOI0910-AG41,,2,The potential effectiveness of warning labels on cigarette packages-the perceptions of young adult Canadians,Canadian Journal of Public Health,0008-4263,"Koval, JJ; Aubut, JAL; Pederson, LL; O'Hegarty, M; Chan, SSH",,Sept-Oct 2005,"University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada; Research Triangle Institute; Centers for Diesease Control and Prevention",National Cancer Institute of Canada,"Background: Since 1989 when health warning labels appeared on Canadian cigarette packages, the labels have changed from text only covering less than one quarter of the package to text and graphics covering over half the package.

Studies were identified from a systemised search in six databases with criteria designed to identity articles of policy relevance.Results: The dominant approach identified from the literature was the imposition of food taxes on food to raise general revenue, such as Value Added Tax in the European Union. Food taxes can be applied in various ways, ranging from attempts to directly influence behaviour to those which collect taxes for identified campaigns on healthy eating through to those applied within closed settings such as schools. There is a case for combining taxes of unhealthy foods with subsidies of healthy foods. The evidence from the literature concerning the use and impact of food taxes on food behaviour is not clear and those cases identified are mainly retrospective descriptions of the process. Many food taxes have been withdrawn after short periods of time due to industry lobbying.Conclusions for policy: Small taxes with the clear purpose of promoting the health of key groups, e.g. children, are more likely to receive public support. The focus of many tax initiatives is unclear; although they are generally aimed at consumers, another focus could be food manufacturers, using taxes and subsidies to encourage the production of healthier foods, which could have an effect at a population level. Further consideration needs to be given to this aspect of food taxes. Taxing food (and subsidies) can influence food behaviour within closed systems such as schools and the workplace.

Age-specific mortality data were used to calculate QALYs lost due to mortality.Results: QALYs lost due to obesity in U.S. adults have more than doubled from 1993 to 2008. Black women had the most QALYs lost due to obesity, at 0.0676 per person in 2008. This number was 31% higher than the QALYs lost in black men and about 50% higher than the QALYs lost in white women and white men. A strong and positive relationship between obesity-related QALYs lost and the percentage of the population reporting no leisure-time physical activity at the state level (r= 0.71) also was found.Conclusions: This analysis enables the overall impact of obesity on both morbidity and mortality to be examined using a single value. The overall health burden of obesity has increased since 1993 and such increases were observed in all gender-by-race subgroups and in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

This paper uses a larger data set and several regression strategies in an attempt to generate more consistent estimates of the effect of weight on wages. Differences across gender, race, and ethnicity are explored.This paper finds that weight lowers wages for white females; OLS estimates indicate that a difference in weight of two standard deviations (roughly 65 pounds) is associated with a difference in wages of 9 percent. In absolute value, this is equivalent to the wage effect of roughly one and a half years of education or three years of work experience. Negative correlations between weight and wages observed for other gender-ethnic groups appear to be due to unobserved heterogeneity.

The objective was to illustrate potential burden of obesity prevalence and health-care costs of obesity and overweight in the United States that would occur if current trends continue. Overweight and obesity prevalence have increased steadily among all US population groups, but with notable differences between groups in annual increase rates. The increase (percentage points) in obesity and overweight in adults was faster than in children (0.77 vs. 0.46-0.49), and in women than in men (0.91 vs. 0.65). If these trends continue, by 2030, 86.3% adults will be overweight or obese; and 51.1%, obese. Black women (96.9%) and Mexican-American men (91.1%) would be the most affected. By 2048, all American adults would become overweight or obese, while black women will reach that state by 2034.

Total reported consumed calories, fat, and the price of the meal ordered were calculated for each meal.Results: For the first 106 adolescents enrolled, 75 did not change any of their orders after being shown the calorie and fat content information. For the 31 who did change some of their orders, 43 meals resulted in decreased calories and 11 meals resulted in increased calories (20 resulted in a more expensive meal, 23 resulted in a less expensive meal and 11 resulted in no change in the cost of the meal; average change $0.027 increase). Of the 27 who rated themselves as too fat or slightly overweight, only 9 (33%) changed their orders.Conclusions: The provision of calorie and fat content information on the menus did not modify the food ordering behavior for the majority of adolescents. However, the provision of the nutrition information should still be encouraged because it resulted in some calorie/fat reduction by some of the adolescents and it did not adversely affect the restaurants' revenue.

The Pyramid's recommendations for added sugars, which vary by total energy level, are posed as a benchmark for gauging the appropriateness of the population's intakes. Data from the Food Supply series and from the Continuing Surveys of Food intakes by Individuals are used to assess recent intakes. The population is consuming added sugars at levels far in excess of recommendations; this is generally true for all population subgroups examined, but especially for adolescents. Soft drinks are the major source of added sugars in the diet. Suggestions are given to facilitate correction of these dietary imbalances.

However, there currently is no way to quantitatively estimate the changes of diet or physical activity required to prevent weight regain. Such a tool would be helpful for goal-setting, because obese patients and their physicians could assess at the outset of an intervention whether long-term adherence to the calculated lifestyle change is realistic.Objective: We aimed to calculate the expected change of steady-state body weight arising from a given change in dietary energy intake and, conversely, to calculate the modification of energy intake required to maintain a particular body-weight change.Design: We developed a mathematical model using data from 8 longitudinal weight-loss studies representing 157 subjects with initial body weights ranging from 68 to 160 kg and stable weight losses between 7 and 54 kg.Results: Model calculations closely matched the change data (R(2) = 0.83, chi(2) = 2.1, P < 0.01 for weight changes; R(2) = 0.91, chi(2) = 0.87, P < 0.0004 for energy intake changes). Our model performed significantly better than the previous models for which chi(2) values were 10-fold those of our model. The model also accurately predicted the proportion of weight change resulting from the loss of body fat (R(2) = 0.90).Conclusions: Our model provides realistic calculations of body-weight change and of the dietary modifications required for weight-loss maintenance. Because the model was implemented by using standard spreadsheet software, it can be widely used by physicians and weight-management professionals. Am J Clin Nutr 2008; 88: 1495-503.

Of notable concern is the fast-food consumption of children. However, we know very little about how children or their parents make fast-food choices, including how they respond to mandatory calorie labeling. We examined children's and adolescents' fast-food choice and the influence of calorie labels in low-income communities in New York City (NYC) and in a comparison city (Newark, NJ).Design: Natural experiment: Survey and receipt data were collected from low-income areas in NYC, and Newark, NJ (as a comparison city), before and after mandatory labeling began in NYC. Study restaurants included four of the largest chains located in NYC and Newark: McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.Subjects: A total of 349 children and adolescents aged 1-17 years who visited the restaurants with their parents (69%) or alone (31%) before or after labeling was introduced. In total, 90% were from racial or ethnic minority groups.Results: We found no statistically significant differences in calories purchased before and after labeling; many adolescents reported noticing calorie labels after their introduction (57% in NYC) and a few considered the information when ordering (9%). Approximately 35% of adolescents ate fast food six or more times per week and 72% of adolescents reported that taste was the most important factor in their meal selection. Adolescents in our sample reported that parents have some influence on their meal selection.Conclusions: Adolescents in low-income communities notice calorie information at similar rates as adults, although they report being slightly less responsive to it than adults. We did not find evidence that labeling influenced adolescent food choice or parental food choices for children in this population.

Parents of children 3 to 6 years of age presenting for an appointment were eligible. Parents were ineligible if they never ate fast food, if they were not English speaking, if their child was too sick, or if they had already participated. This was a convenience sample, with randomization performed in blocks of 6. Parents were presented with a McDonald's menu and were asked to select meals for themselves and their child. The menus were identical for both groups except for the presence of nutrition information for the intervention group.RESULTS: There were 99 participants, for a participation rate of 82%. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. Parents in the intervention arm ordered an average of 102 fewer calories for their children than did control subjects (567.1 cal vs 671.5 cal; P = .04). With adjustment for parent's gender, race, education, and BMI, fast food frequency, and child's BMI z score, the difference remained significant (P = .004). There was no difference in energy between the 2 groups in the parents' choices for themselves.CONCLUSION: This study is the first to suggest that labeled menus may lead to significantly lower calorie content in restaurant meals purchased for children.

Maximum Likelihood Heckman Selection with Smearing retransformation was used to assess medical expenditures, and Negative Binomial regression was used for missed work days.Results: Normal weight individuals with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension had significantly greater medical expenditures than those without the respective condition ($6,006 (5,124-6,887), $4,760 (4,102-5,417), $3,911 (3,345-4,476)) and obesity significantly exacerbated this effect ($7,986 (7,397-8,574), $7,636 (7,072-8,200), $6,197 (5,745-6,649); $2007; all P < 0.05). In addition, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension resulted in greater missed work days (3.1 (0.94-6.21), 3.2 (0.42-7.91), 1.4 (0.0-3.52)) (all P < 0.05 except hypertension), which resulted in greater lost productivity ($433, $451, $199) and obesity significantly exacerbated the deleterious effect on work days (8.7 (4.44-15.2), 5.5 (2.18-10.5), 4.5 (2.92-6.34)) and lost productivity ($1,217, $763, $622) (all P < 0.05). In addition, medical expenditures increased for increasing weight category and increasing number of risk factors.Discussion: Obesity significantly exacerbates the deleterious effect of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension on medical expenditures and productivity loss in the United States.

It is important that individuals recognize their overweight status as a health risk in order for an effective change in lifestyle behaviors to occur, and growing evidence suggests that actual weight and perception of weight status often do not match, especially among adolescents. In this article, we explore the extent to which exposure to heavier peers and parents affects misperception of their own weight status by adolescents. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we estimated instrumental variable models with school-level fixed effects to account for bidirectionality of peer influence and environmental confounders. Our results indicate that individuals who live in an environment that exposes them to overweight/obese parents and heavier peers tend to misperceive their weight status and think of themselves to be of lower weight than they actually are.

During the same period, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in children also rose significantly. Previous literature suggests an association between actual body weight and mental health, but there is little evidence on self-perception of weight and mental health status. Aim: To examine the relationship between actual body weight, self-perception of body weight and mental health outcomes among adolescents.Methodology:Using data for a nationally-representative sample of adolescents in the United States, we ascertain the effect of body weight status on depressive symptoms by estimating endogeneity-corrected models including school-level fixed effects to account for bi-directionality and unobserved confounders. Actual body weight status was calculated using interviewer-measured height and weight. We also used a measure of self-perceived weight status to compare how actual versus self-perceived weight status affects mental health. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem (RSE) Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, and a dichotomous version of self-reported indicator for depression were utilized as mental health indicators. Potential mediators between mental health and weight status such as levels of physical activity, participation in risky health behaviors and parental characteristics were also controlled for in the analysis. The analytical sample consisted of 13,454 adolescents aged 11 to 18.Results and Discussion: After accounting for a wide array of relevant characteristics, we did not find a direct and significant association between actual weight status and mental health outcomes. Instead, our analysis revealed a strongly negative and significant relationship between self-perceived weight status and mental health. The negative relationship between self-perceived weight and depressive symptoms was more pronounced among females. The RSE scale was particularly correlated with body weight perceptions, suggesting a potentially important link between weight perception and self esteem.Limitations: While the data set has rich detail on body weight and mental health outcomes, it lacks information on weight stigmatization. The complex relationships between actual body weight, self-perception of weight and weight stigmatization also limit determination of causality.Conclusion and Implications: The results from this study highlight the role of body weight perceptions in influencing mental health outcomes independent of actual weight status, especially among female adolescents. This suggests that policies aimed at improving mental health outcomes among adolescents might benefit from a focus on increasing awareness about healthy attitudes towards weight.Future Research: Recent studies have found evidence that weight stigmatization and body dissatisfaction are predictors of depressive symptoms. It may be that the causal pathway between perceived weight status and depression occurs through weight stigmatization and body dissatisfaction. Future studies should investigate this causal mechanism further.

Under the NLEA regulations, a 'Nutrition Facts' panel displays information on nutrients such as calories, total and saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium in a standardized format. By providing nutrition information in a credible, distinctive, and easy-to-read format, the new label was expected to help consumers choose healthier, more nutritious diets. This paper examines whether the disclosure of nutrition information through the mandatory labels impacted consumer diets. Assessing the dietary effects of labeling is problematic due to the confounding of the label effect with unobserved label user characteristics. This self-selection problem is addressed by exploiting the fact that the NLEA exempts away-from home foods from mandatory labeling. Difference-in-differences models that account for zero away-from-home intakes suggest that the labels increase fiber and iron intakes of label users compared with label nonusers. In comparison, a model that does not account for self-selection implies significant label effects for all but two of the 13 nutrients that are listed on the label.

Our results, based on state soft drink sales and excise tax information between 1989 and 2006 and the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, suggest that soft drink taxation, as currently practiced in the United States, leads to a moderate reduction in soft drink consumption by children and adolescents.

Restaurants provide a growing and substantial portion of the average American's diet, yet the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), which went into effect in 1994, explicitly exempts restaurants front most labeling requirements. Thus, this study examined the availability of nutrition information from the largest chain restaurants in the United States. Methods: Between January and August 2004, we surveyed the 300 largest chain restaurants by telephone, e-mail, or examining company websites (response rate was 96%). The top chains, as ranked by revenue, were selected based on 2002 ratings in Restaurants and Institutions. Results: Fifty-four percent of the 287 largest chain restaurants made some nutrition information available. Forty-four percent had nutrition information for the majority of their standard menu items. We found no significant differences in the availability of nutrition information based on the size of the restaurant chain. Of those restaurants with nutrition information, 86% provided information on the company website.Conclusions: The number of restaurants providing nutrition information has increased over the last 10 years. However, making informed and healthful food choices is hampered by the absence of nutrition information at many restaurants. Given the growing and significant role that away4rom-home foods play in Americans' diets, the Surgeon General and the National Academies' Institute of Medicine recommend that nutrition information be available to customers at restaurants, and state legislatures and the U.S. Congress are beginning to address the issue.",Scholarly Journal,0910-AG57,,5,Obesity-Related Quality-Adjusted Life Years Lost in the U.S. from 1993-2008,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,0749-3797,"H.

Purpose: This study examined trends in the burden of obesity by estimating the obesity-related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost-defined as the sum of QALYs lost due to morbidity and future QALYs lost in expected life years due to premature deaths-among U.S. adults along with differences by gender, race/ethnicity, and state. Methods: Health-related quality-of-life data were taken from the 1993-2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to calculate QALYs lost due to morbidity. Age-specific mortality data were used to calculate QALYs lost due to mortality. Results: QALYs lost due to obesity in U.S. adults have more than doubled from 1993 to 2008. Black women had the most QALYs lost due to obesity, at 0.0676 per person in 2008. This number was 31% higher than the QALYs lost in black men and about 50% higher than the QALYs lost in white women and white men. A strong and positive relationship between obesity-related QALYs lost and the percentage of the population reporting no leisure-time physical activity at the state level (r= 0.71) also was found. Conclusions: This analysis enables the overall impact of obesity on both morbidity and mortality to be examined using a single value. The overall health burden of obesity has increased since 1993 and such increases were observed in all gender-by-race subgroups and in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Methods: Population HRQOL data were from the 1993-2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System The QALYs lost contributed by a risk factor is the sum of QALYs lost due to morbidity in the Current year and future QALYs lost in expected life-years due to premature deaths (mortality). Premature deaths were estimated from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files and mortality statistics. Results: From 1993 to 2008, the proportion of smokers among U.S. adults declined 18.5% whereas the proportion of obese people increased 8596 The smoking-related QALYs lost were relatively stable at 0.0438 QALYs lost per Population. In 1993 the QALYs lost were much smaller for obesity compared to smoking, with obesity contributing about 0.0204 QALYs lost. However, as a result of the increasing prevalence of obesity, the contribution of obesity-related QALYs lost increased consistently and had increased by 127% in 2008 when obesity resulted in 0.0464 QALYs lost, slightly more than smoking did Smoking had a bigger impact on mortality than morbidity, whereas obesity had a bigger impact oil morbidity than mortality. Conclusions: This Study estimated the overall burden of smoking and obesity over time and results indicate that because of the marked increase in the proportion of obese people, obesity has become an equal, if not greater, contributor to the burden of disease than smoking Such data are essential in setting targets for reducing modifiable health risks and eliminating health disparities.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to quantify the impact of the King County regulation on transactions and purchasing behavior at one Mexican fast-food chain with locations within and adjacent to King County. Methods: To examine the effect of the King County regulation, a difference-in-difference approach was used to compare total transactions and average calories per transaction between seven King County restaurants and seven control locations focusing on two time periods: one period immediately following the law until the posting of drive-through menu boards (January 2009 to July 2009) and a second period following the drive-through postings (August 2009 through January 2010). Analyses were conducted in 2010. Results: No impact of the regulation on purchasing behavior was found. Trends in transactions and calories per transaction did not vary between control and intervention locations after the law was enacted. Conclusions: In this setting, mandatory menu labeling did not promote healthier food-purchasing behavior.

We use a first-difference estimator to establish a causal relationship between FAFH and dietary intakes. Using dietary recall data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, we find that FAFH does indeed increase caloric intake and reduce diet quality, but that the effect is smaller than if estimated using OLS. Thus, models based on associations are likely biased upward, as much as 25% by our estimates.

The objective was to illustrate potential burden of obesity prevalence and health-care costs of obesity and overweight in the United States that would occur if current trends continue. Overweight and obesity prevalence have increased steadily among all US population groups, but with notable differences between groups in annual increase rates. The increase (percentage points) in obesity and overweight in adults was faster than in children (0.77 vs. 0.46-0.49), and in women than in men (0.91 vs. 0.65). If these trends continue, by 2030, 86.3% adults will be overweight or obese; and 51.1%, obese. Black women (96.9%) and Mexican-American men (91.1%) would be the most affected.

Methods: Adolescent volunteers (aged I I to 18 years) were asked to order a dinner of their choice from three different restaurant menus (McDonald's, Panda Express, and Denny's) and then from a second set of modified menus with calorie and fat content information posted next to each menu item. Total reported consumed calories, fat, and the price of the meal ordered were calculated for each meal. Results: For the first 106 adolescents enrolled, 75 did not change any of their orders after being shown the calorie and fat content information. For the 31 who did change some of their orders, 43 meals resulted in decreased calories and 11 meals resulted in increased calories (20 resulted in a more expensive meal, 23 resulted in a less expensive meal and 11 resulted in no change in the cost of the meal; average change $0.027 increase). Of the 27 who rated themselves as too fat or slightly overweight, only 9 (33%) changed their orders. Conclusions: The provision of calorie and fat content information on the menus did not modify the food ordering behavior for the majority of adolescents. However, the provision of the nutrition information should still be encouraged because it resulted in some calorie/fat reduction by some of the adolescents and it did not adversely affect the restaurants' revenue.

Objective To examine trends in obesity from 1999 through 2008 and the current prevalence of obesity and overweight for 2007-2008. Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of height and weight measurements from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 20072008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006. Main Outcome Measure Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. Results In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.6%-36.0%) overall, 32.2% (95% CI, 29.5%-35.0%) among men, and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.2%-37.7%) among women. The corresponding prevalence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI >= 25) were 68.0% (95% CI, 66.3%-69.8%), 72.3% (95% CI, 70.4%-74.1%), and 64.1% (95% CI, 61.3%-66.9%). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.89-1.32]).

However, there currently is no way to quantitatively estimate the changes of diet or physical activity required to prevent weight regain. Such a tool would be helpful for goal-setting, because obese patients and their physicians could assess at the outset of an intervention whether long-term adherence to the calculated lifestyle change is realistic. Objective: We aimed to calculate the expected change of steady-state body weight arising from a given change in dietary energy intake and, conversely, to calculate the modification of energy intake required to maintain a particular body-weight change. Design: We developed a mathematical model using data from 8 longitudinal weight-loss studies representing 157 subjects with initial body weights ranging from 68 to 160 kg and stable weight losses between 7 and 54 kg. Results: Model calculations closely matched the change data (R(2) = 0.83, chi(2) = 2.1, P < 0.01 for weight changes; R(2) = 0.91, chi(2) = 0.87, P < 0.0004 for energy intake changes). Our model performed significantly better than the previous models for which chi(2) values were 10-fold those of our model. The model also accurately predicted the proportion of weight change resulting from the loss of body fat (R(2) = 0.90). Conclusions: Our model provides realistic calculations of body-weight change and of the dietary modifications required for weight-loss maintenance. Because the model was implemented by using standard spreadsheet software, it can be widely used by physicians and weight-management professionals.

Of notable concern is the fast-food consumption of children. However, we know very little about how children or their parents make fast-food choices, including how they respond to mandatory calorie labeling. We examined children's and adolescents' fast-food choice and the influence of calorie labels in low-income communities in New York City (NYC) and in a comparison city (Newark, NJ). Design: Natural experiment: Survey and receipt data were collected from low-income areas in NYC, and Newark, NJ (as a comparison city), before and after mandatory labeling began in NYC. Study restaurants included four of the largest chains located in NYC and Newark: McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Subjects: A total of 349 children and adolescents aged 1-17 years who visited the restaurants with their parents (69%) or alone (31%) before or after labeling was introduced. In total, 90% were from racial or ethnic minority groups. Results: We found no statistically significant differences in calories purchased before and after labeling; many adolescents reported noticing calorie labels after their introduction (57% in NYC) and a few considered the information when ordering (9%). Approximately 35% of adolescents ate fast food six or more times per week and 72% of adolescents reported that taste was the most important factor in their meal selection. Adolescents in our sample reported that parents have some influence on their meal selection.  Conclusions: Adolescents in low-income communities notice calorie information at similar rates as adults, although they report being slightly less responsive to it than adults. We did not find evidence that labeling influenced adolescent food choice or parental food choices for children in this population.

We argue that technological change has induced weight growth by making home- and market-production more sedentary and by lowering food prices through agricultural innovation. In addition, we illustrate that, while exercise and food intake are complements, reductions in exercise will always raise optimal body weight, as will increases in food intake. We also characterize how body weight varies with income, both within a country, and across countries. Within a country, income may have an inverted U-shaped relationship with body weight, due to the offsetting effects of the demand for food, and the demand for an ideal body weight. This can have important implications for the body weight impacts of public transfer programs. Across countries, however, mean weight is likely to be higher in richer countries. Finally, we present descriptive empirical evidence that illustrates the inverted U-shaped relationship between body weight and income in US males, and suggests the importance of secular trends in weight gain, which are consistent with the impacts of broad-based technological changes.

METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled experiment in a primary care pediatric clinic in Seattle, Washington. Parents of children 3 to 6 years of age presenting for an appointment were eligible. Parents were ineligible if they never ate fast food, if they were not English speaking, if their child was too sick, or if they had already participated. This was a convenience sample, with randomization performed in blocks of 6. Parents were presented with a McDonald's menu and were asked to select meals for themselves and their child. The menus were identical for both groups except for the presence of nutrition information for the intervention group. RESULTS: There were 99 participants, for a participation rate of 82%. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. Parents in the intervention arm ordered an average of 102 fewer calories for their children than did control subjects (567.1 cal vs 671.5 cal; P = .04). With adjustment for parent's gender, race, education, and BMI, fast food frequency, and child's BMI z score, the difference remained significant (P = .004). There was no difference in energy between the 2 groups in the parents' choices for themselves. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to suggest that labeled menus may lead to significantly lower calorie content in restaurant meals purchased for children.

A growth in obesity in a population must result from the growth of calorie consumption outpacing the growth of physical activity. Yet historically in developed countries, obesity has grown with modest rises in calorie consumption and with a substantial increase in both exercise and dieting. We consider the economic incentives that give rise to the long-run growth in obesity by stimulating intake of calories at the same time as discouraging the expending of calories on physical activity, whether in work or leisure. We argue that technological change provides a natural interpretation of the long-run growth in obesity; that it predicts that the effect of income on obesity changes from positive to negative with economic development, and that it implies that technological change may not continue to raise weight.

Methods and Procedures: The 2000 and 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of the US population, was used to estimate the marginal effect of obesity (BMI >= 30) on annual per-person medical expenditures and missed work days for patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension using multivariate regression methods controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, income, insurance, and smoking status. Maximum Likelihood Heckman Selection with Smearing retransformation was used to assess medical expenditures, and Negative Binomial regression was used for missed work days. Results: Normal weight individuals with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension had significantly greater medical expenditures than those without the respective condition ($6,006 (5,124-6,887), $4,760 (4,102-5,417), $3,911 (3,345-4,476)) and obesity significantly exacerbated this effect ($7,986 (7,397-8,574), $7,636 (7,072-8,200), $6,197 (5,745-6,649); $2007; all P < 0.05). In addition, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension resulted in greater missed work days (3.1 (0.94-6.21), 3.2 (0.42-7.91), 1.4 (0.0-3.52)) (all P < 0.05 except hypertension), which resulted in greater lost productivity ($433, $451, $199) and obesity significantly exacerbated the deleterious effect on work days (8.7 (4.44-15.2), 5.5 (2.18-10.5), 4.5 (2.92-6.34)) and lost productivity ($1,217, $763, $622) (all P < 0.05). In addition, medical expenditures increased for increasing weight category and increasing number of risk factors.

In this article, we explore the extent to which exposure to heavier peers and parents affects misperception of their own weight status by adolescents. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we estimated instrumental variable models with school-level fixed effects to account for bidirectionality of peer influence and environmental confounders.

During the same period, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in children also rose significantly. Previous literature suggests an association between actual body weight and mental health, but there is little evidence on self-perception of weight and mental health status. Aim: To examine the relationship between actual body weight, self-perception of body weight and mental health outcomes among adolescents. Methodology: Using data for a nationally-representative sample of adolescents in the United States, we ascertain the effect of body weight status on depressive symptoms by estimating endogeneity-corrected models including school-level fixed effects to account for bi-directionality and unobserved confounders. Actual body weight status was calculated using interviewer-measured height and weight. We also used a measure of self-perceived weight status to compare how actual versus self-perceived weight status affects mental health. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem (RSE) Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, and a dichotomous version of self-reported indicator for depression were utilized as mental health indicators. Potential mediators between mental health and weight status such as levels of physical activity, participation in risky health behaviors and parental characteristics were also controlled for in the analysis. The analytical sample consisted of 13,454 adolescents aged 11 to 18. Results and Discussion: After accounting for a wide array of relevant characteristics, we did not find a direct and significant association between actual weight status and mental health outcomes. Instead, our analysis revealed a strongly negative and significant relationship between self-perceived weight status and mental health. The negative relationship between self-perceived weight and depressive symptoms was more pronounced among females. The RSE scale was particularly correlated with body weight perceptions, suggesting a potentially important link between weight perception and self esteem. Limitations: While the data set has rich detail on body weight and mental health outcomes, it lacks information on weight stigmatization. The complex relationships between actual body weight, self-perception of weight and weight stigmatization also limit determination of causality. Conclusion and Implications: The results from this study highlight the role of body weight perceptions in influencing mental health outcomes independent of actual weight status, especially among female adolescents. This suggests that policies aimed at improving mental health outcomes among adolescents might benefit from a focus on increasing awareness about healthy attitudes towards weight. Future Research: Recent studies have found evidence that weight stigmatization and body dissatisfaction are predictors of depressive symptoms. It may be that the causal pathway between perceived weight status and depression occurs through weight stigmatization and body dissatisfaction. Future studies should investigate this causal mechanism further.",Scholarly Journal,No DOI0910-AG57,,5,Do Nutrition Labels Improve Dietary Outcomes?,Health Economics,1057-9230,"Variyam, J.N.",10.1002/hec.1287,8-Jun,US Department of Agriculture,US Department of Agriculture,"The disclosure of nutritional characteristics of most packaged foods became mandatory in the United States with the implementation of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) in 1994. Under the NLEA regulations, a 'Nutrition Facts' panel displays information on nutrients such as calories, total and saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium in a standardized format. By providing nutrition information in a credible, distinctive, and easy-to-read format, the new label was expected to help consumers choose healthier, more nutritious diets. This paper examines whether the disclosure of nutrition information through the mandatory labels impacted consumer diets. Assessing the dietary effects of labeling is problematic due to the confounding of the label effect with unobserved label user characteristics. This self-selection problem is addressed by exploiting the fact that the NLEA exempts away-from home foods from mandatory labeling. Difference-in-differences models that account for zero away-from-home intakes suggest that the labels increase fiber and iron intakes of label users compared with label nonusers. In comparison, a model that does not account for self-selection implies significant label effects for all but two of the 13 nutrients that are listed on the label.

Our objective was to compare changes in mortality and life expectancy among HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy. Methods The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration is a multinational collaboration of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America. Patients were included in this analysis if they were aged 16 years or over and antiretroviral-naive when initiating combination therapy. We constructed abridged life tables to estimate life expectancies for individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05, and stratified by sex, baseline CD4 cell count, and history of injecting drug use. The average number of years remaining to be lived by those treated with combination antiretroviral therapy at 20 and 35 years of age was estimated. Potential years of life lost from 20 to 64 years of age and crude mortality rates were also calculated. Findings 18 587, 13 914, and 10 854 eligible patients initiated combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05, respectively. 2056 (4.7%) deaths were observed during the study period, with crude mortality rates decreasing from 16.3 deaths per 1000 person-years in 1996-99 to 10 . 0 deaths per 1000 person-years in 2003-05. Potential years of life lost per 1000 person-years also decreased over the same time, from 366 to 189 years. Life expectancy at age 20 years increased from 36. 1 (S E 0 . 6) years to 49.4 (0.5) years. Women had higher life expectancies than did men. Patients with presumed transmission via injecting drug use had lower life expectancies than did those from other transmission groups (32.6 [1. 1] years vs 44.7 [0.3] years in 2003-05). Life expectancy was lower in patients with lower baseline CD4 cell counts than in those with higher baseline counts (32.4 [1. 1] years for CD4 cell counts below 100 cells per mu L vs 50.4 [0.4] years for counts of 200 cells per mu L or more). Interpretation life expectancy in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy increased between 1996 and 2005, although there is considerable variability between subgroups of patients. The average number of years remaining to be lived at age 20 years was about two-thirds of that in the general population in these countries.

Using the lower bounds, the transmission rate from the unaware group was 3.5 times that of the aware group after adjusting for population size differences between groups. Conclusion: The results indicate that the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be lessened substantially by increasing the number of HIV-positive persons who are aware of their status.

Multivariable analyses controlled for potentially confounding variables. Tests for effect modification by gender and Mexican origin were conducted. Results: Fewer first generation adolescents transitioned to sexual intercourse before age 18 (odds ratio [OR] = .80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .66-.98) and fewer first and second generation sexually active teens used contraceptives consistently at age 17 (OR = .32, 95% CI = .17-60 and OR = .50, 95% CI = .31-80, respectively) than third-generation teens. Language was similarly associated with the transition to sexual intercourse and contraceptive practices. Versus teens of Mexican origin, teens of Puerto Rican origin and origins other than Cuba and Central/South America had greater odds of becoming sexually active; youth of all origins except Central/South America had fewer multiple live births (OR = .14-31). Gender modified the effects of generation on consistent use of contraceptives and condoms at age 17. Gender also modified the effect of country of origin on transitioning to sexual intercourse before age 18 years. Conclusions: Results expand on previous observations that generation, language, and country of origin are predictors of reproductive and sexual risks for Hispanic adolescents.

HIV treatment drug regimen efficacies were from clinical guidelines and published sources; data on other drugs used were not available. In a computer simulation model, we projected HIV medical care costs in 2004 U.S. dollars. Results: From the time of entering HIV care, per person projected life expectancy is 24.2 years, discounted lifetime cost is $385,200, and undiscounted cost is $618,900 for adults who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 350/mu L. Seventy-three percent of the cost is antiretroviral medications, 13% inpatient care, 9% outpatient care, and 5% other HIV-related medications and laboratory costs. For patients who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 200/mu L, projected life expectancy is 22.5 years, discounted lifetime cost is $354,100 and undiscounted cost is $567,000. Results are sensitive to drug manufacturers' discounts, ART efficacy, and use of enfavirtide for salvage. If costs are discounted to the time of infection, the discounted lifetime cost is $303,100. Conclusions: Effective ART regimens have substantially improved survival and have increased the lifetime cost of HIV-related medical care in the U.S.",Scholarly Journal,0920-AA26,,19,Effects of immigration on selected health risk behaviors of Black college students,"Journal of American College Health, 2003. 52(3): p. 113–20",0744-8481,"Kenya, S.; et al.",,2003,"Department of Medicine, Gastrointestinal Division at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; York College, City University of New York; Teachers College; Columbia University",City University of New York,"The authors administered the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey to 1,219 college students who were attending a historically Black college located in New York City.

Black West Indian men were less likely than were US-born Blackmen to report nonregular partners. There were no differences in condom use. US-born Black women were more likely than were Black West Indian women to be extremely confident that they could convince their regular partners to use condoms (odds ratio [OR]=2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.21, 4.76), whereas there were no differences between Black West Indian and US-born Black men on this measure (interaction P=.06).

Over 30 million persons world-wide are estimated to be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Concurrently, about 100 million persons move voluntarily within or between nations each year, while almost 40 million are either internally displaced or refugees outside their own countries. Previously, governments' main concern was that incoming migrants might bring HIV with them. While this scenario still applies, there is increasing recognition that migrants may be more vulnerable than local populations to acquiring the infection during migration, and that they may spread the infection upon return to their respective homes. This article is jointly authored by the two international organizations with major responsibilities in the fields of migration and HIV/AIDS. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) upholds the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society. Among its responsibilities, the IOM is dedicated to advancing understanding of migration issues and work towards effective respect of the human dignity and well being of migrants. The United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) is the main advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS. Part of its mission is to lead, strengthen and support an expanded response to the epidemic. UNAIDS does this through strategic alliances with its UN cosponsors as well as other partners. In order to address gaps in policy and research, and better identify the priorities for further work, UNAIDS and the IOM undertook a joint project to review the current state of knowledge about migration and HIV/AIDS, and to identify priority areas and issues for research and intervention.

The impact of cross-cultural migrations and the importance of studying that impact in terms of demographic characteristics as well as cultural and environmental factors has not received adequate attention in public health research. This collaborative analysis utilizes data from three studies of immigrant groups in New York to describe and compare these factors that provide the context for risk and prevention of HIVAIDS and other health challenges. Data discussed were obtained utilizing multi-method approaches to identify, and describe HI V risks among both new and more established immigrant populations within the urban settings of North America, with NYC as a central focus. Demographic and epidemiological data situate the analysis within the larger contexts of US migration and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in NYC. The authors identify risk and protective factors embedded to varying degrees in immigrants' multiple cultures and sub-cultures. The three populations studied include: 1) new Hispanic immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Central America; 2) West Indian (Caribbean) immigrants front Jamaica, Trinidad/ Tobago and other anglophone Caribbean nations; and 3) South Asian immigrants from India (Indian Americans). The paper seeks differences and commonalities, focusing on the social, attitudinal and behavioral factors that contribute to increased HIV/AIDS vulnerability among these populations. The data presented also identify some of the attitudes and behaviors of individuals and groups, as well as other facilitators and obstacles to transmission for immigrants as they adapt to new environments. Topics addressed include factors affecting HIV/AIDS vulnerability of immigrant groups, goals and expectations, health and mental health issues, gender role change, sexual risk, alcohol and other drug rise, perception of HIV/AIDS risk and implications for prevention.",Scholarly Journal,"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/ query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=16736354."0938-AM50,,6,An Updated Survey of Health Care Claims Receipt and Processing Times,AHIP,,,,6-May,,,,Non-Government Report,Available at http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/PromptPayFinalDraft.pdf0938-AO47,,8,,"Medicaid StatisticalInformation System",,,,,,,,Database,0938-AO47,,8,"Medicaid ExpenditurePanel Survey",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,,,,2004,,,,Government Report,0938-AO47,,8,,U.S. Government Accountability Office,,,,2004,,,,Government Report,Data on primiums 0938-AO47,,8,Circular A–4,Office of Management and Budget,,,,,,,,Regulation,http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a004/a-4.pdf0938-AO47,,8,Deficit Reduction Act,,,,,2005,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,Deficit Reduction Act of 2005,,,,,5-Jan,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,Executive Order 12866,,,,,,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,Executive Order 13132,,,,,,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,"Sec. 1102 of the Social SecurityAct (42 U.S.C. 1302)",,,,,,,,,Regulation,42 U.S.C. 13020938-AO47,,8,"Tax Relief andHealth Care Act",,,,,2006,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,"UnfundedMandates Reform Act of 1995",,,,,Jan-95,,,,Regulation,0938-AO47,,8,,"2004 KaiserFamily Foundation",,,,,,,,,0938-AO48,,7,President's Budget ,Appropriations,,US Congress,,2007,,,,Other0938-AO48,,7,Deficit Reduction Act,,,US Congress,,2005,,,,Regulation0938-AO48,,7,OMB Circular A-4,http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a004/a-4.pdf,,Office of Management and Budget,,,,,,Regulation0938-AO48,,7,Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980,Pub.

Ambulatory medical care utilization is described in terms of patient, provider, and visit characteristics. METHODS: Data from the 2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were combined to produce annual estimates of ambulatory medical care utilization. RESULTS: Patients in the United States made an estimated 1.2 billion visits to physician offices and hospital OPDs and EDs, a rate of 405.0 visits per 100 persons annually. This was not significantly different than the rate of 381.9 visits per 100 persons in 2006, neither were significant differences found in overall visit rates by age, sex, or geographic region. Visit distribution by ambulatory care setting differed by poverty level in the patient's ZIP Code of residence, with higher proportions of visits to hospital OPDs and EDs as poverty levels increased. Between 1997 and 2007, the age-adjusted visit rate increased by 11 percent, fueled mainly by a 29 percent increase in the visit rate to medical specialty offices. Nonillness and noninjury conditions, such as general and prenatal exams, accounted for the largest percentage of ambulatory care diagnoses in 2007, about 19 per 100 visits. Seven of 10 ambulatory care visits had at least one medication provided, prescribed, or continued in 2007, for a total of 2.7 billion drugs overall. These were not significantly different than 2006 figures. Analgesics were the most common therapeutic category, accounting for 13.1 drugs per 100 drugs reported, and were most often utilized at primary care and ED visits. The number of viral vaccines that were ordered or provided increased by 79 percent, from 33.2 million occurrences in 2006 to 59.3 million in 2007; significant increases were also noted for anticonvulsants and antiemetics.",Scholarly Journal,0938-AQ13,,11,What Does it cost physician practices to interact with health insurance plans?,Health Affairs ,0278-2715,"Casalino, Lawrence P.; Nicholson, Sean; Gans, David N.; et al.",10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.w533,9-Aug,"Cornell Medical College; Cornell University; Medical Group Management Association; Toronto General Hospital, University of Toronto; University of Chicago; University of Toronto",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; The Commonwealth Fund,"Physicians have long expressed dissatisfaction with the time they and their staffs spend interacting with health plans.

The basis for our calculations is simulated bill paying for a large standardized population. After adjusting for the quality of benefits, we find from regression analysis that adjusted premiums are 18 percent higher in the nation's smallest firms than in firms with 1,000 or more workers. They are 25 percent higher in indemnity plans and 18 percent higher in preferred provider organizations than in health maintenance organizations.

Our objective is to determine the relationship between health reform and ED use for low-severity conditions.Methods: We studied ED visits, using a convenience sample of 11 Massachusetts hospitals for identical 9-month periods before and after health care reform legislation was implemented in 2006. Individuals most affected by the health reform law (the uninsured and low-income populations covered by the publicly subsidized insurance products) were compared with individuals unlikely to be affected by the legislation (those with Medicare or private insurance). Our main outcome measure was the rate of overall and low-severity ED visits for the study population and the comparison population during the period before and after health reform implementation.Results: Total visits increased from 424,878 in 2006 to 442,102 in 2008. Low-severity visits among publicly subsidized or uninsured patients decreased from 43.8% to 41.2% of total visits for that group (difference=2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25% to 2.85%), whereas low-severity visits for privately insured and Medicare patients decreased from 35.7% to 34.9% of total visits for that group (difference=0.8%; 95% CI 0.62% to 0.98%), for a difference in differences of 1.8% (95% CI 1.7% to 1.9%).Conclusion: Although overall ED volume continues to increase, Massachusetts health reform was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in the rate of low-severity visits for those populations most affected by health reform compared with a comparison population of individuals less likely to be affected by the reform. Our findings suggest that access to health insurance is only one of a multitude of factors affecting utilization of the ED.

African American and Hispanic patients were each compared with white patients and insured patients were compared with uninsured patients. Multiple logistic regression analyses determined differences in survival rates after adjusting for demographics, injury severity (Injury Severity Score and revised Trauma Score), severity of head and/or extremity injury, and injury mechanism.Results: A total of 429 751 patients met inclusion criteria. African American (n = 72 249) and Hispanic (n = 41 770) patients were less likely to be insured and more likely to sustain penetrating trauma than white patients (n = 262 878). African American and Hispanic patients had higher unadjusted mortality rates (white, 5.7%; African American, 8..2%; Hispanic, 9.1%; P = .05 for African American and Hispanic patients) and an increased adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death compared with white patients (African American OR, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.23; Hispanic OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.39-1.57). Insured patients (47%) had lower crude mortality rates than uninsured patients (4.4% vs 8.6%; P = .05).

Our objective is to determine the relationship between health reform and ED use for low-severity conditions. Methods: We studied ED visits, using a convenience sample of 11 Massachusetts hospitals for identical 9-month periods before and after health care reform legislation was implemented in 2006. Individuals most affected by the health reform law (the uninsured and low-income populations covered by the publicly subsidized insurance products) were compared with individuals unlikely to be affected by the legislation (those with Medicare or private insurance). Our main outcome measure was the rate of overall and low-severity ED visits for the study population and the comparison population during the period before and after health reform implementation. Results: Total visits increased from 424,878 in 2006 to 442,102 in 2008. Low-severity visits among publicly subsidized or uninsured patients decreased from 43.8% to 41.2% of total visits for that group (difference=2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25% to 2.85%), whereas low-severity visits for privately insured and Medicare patients decreased from 35.7% to 34.9% of total visits for that group (difference=0.8%; 95% CI 0.62% to 0.98%), for a difference in differences of 1.8% (95% CI 1.7% to 1.9%).

Experience curves of wind turbines are generally based oil data describing the development of national markets, which cause a number of problems when applied for global assessments. To analyze global wind energy price development more adequately, we compose a global experience curve. First, underlying factors for past and potential future price reductions of wind turbines are analyzed. Also possible implications and pitfalls when applying the experience curve methodology are assessed. Second, we present and discuss a new approach of establishing a global experience curve and thus a global progress ratio for the investment cost of wind farms. Results show that global progress ratios for wind farms may lie between 77% and 85% (with an average of 81%), which is significantly more optimistic than progress ratios applied in most current scenario studies and integrated assessment models. While the findings are based on a limited amount of data, they may indicate faster price reduction opportunities than so far assumed. With this global experience curve we aim to improve the reliability of describing the speed with which global costs of wind power may decline. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors estimate the tangible and intangible financial costs of sexual violence in Michigan. In 1996, rape and sexual assault cost Michigan more than $6.5 billion, most of which came in the form of intangible costs. Sex-offense homicide cost more than $18 million, two thirds of which was intangible costs. If divided equally as a ""rape tax,"" each resident Of Michigan would have paid nearly $700 in 1996 to cover the cost of sexual violence. The implication is that prevention is the best way to reduce the high cost of sexual violence. Furthermore, rape and sexual assault need to be identified as a public health issue to raise awareness about sexual violence. Finally, courts and prosecutors need to think about sexual violence as an economic crime to better protect victims and survivors of sexual violence.

It is adapted from the contingent valuation method used in the environmental economics literature and is itself used to estimate the public's willingness to pay for crime control programs. In a nationally representative sample of 1,300 U.S. residents, we found that the typical household would be willing to pay between $100 and $150 per year for programs that reduced specific crimes by 10 percent in their communities. This willingness amounts, collectively, to approximately $25,000 per burglary, $70,000 per serious assault, $232,000 per armed robbery, $237,000 per rape and sexual assault, and $9.7 million per murder.

Findings from this qualitative study of physician practices suggest that substantial gaps may exist between advocates' vision of e-prescribing and how physicians use commercial e-prescribing systems today. While physicians were positive about the most basic e-prescribing features, they reported major barriers to maintaining complete patient medication lists, using clinical decision support, obtaining formulary data, and electronically transmitting prescriptions to pharmacies.

The authors aimed to develop a conceptual framework for anticipating the effects of alternative designs for outpatient e-prescribing systems.  Design: Based on a literature review and on telephone interviews with e-prescribing vendors, the authors identified distinct e-prescribing functional capabilities and developed a conceptual framework for evaluating e-prescribing systems' potential effects based on their capabilities. Analyses of two commercial e-prescribing systems are presented as examples of applying the conceptual framework.  Measurements: Major e-prescribing functional capabilities identified and the availability of evidence to support their specific effects.  Results: The proposed framework for evaluating e-prescribing systems is organized using a process model of medication management. Fourteen e-prescribing functional capabilities are identified within the model. Evidence is identified to support eight specific effects for six of the functional capabilities. The evidence also shows that a functional capability with generally positive effects can be implemented in a way that creates unintended hazards. Applying the framework involves identifying an e-prescribing system's functional capabilities within the process model and then assessing the effects that could be expected from each capability in the proposed clinical environment.  Conclusion: The proposed conceptual framework supports the integration of available evidence in considering the full range of effects from e-prescribing design alternatives. More research is needed into the effects of specific e-prescribing functional alternatives.

Design: A descriptive field study of ten commercially available ambulatory electronic prescribing systems, each of which had established a significant market presence. Data were collected from vendors by telephone interview and at sites where the systems were functioning through direct observation of the systems and through personal interviews with prescribers and technical staff.  Measurements: The capabilities of electronic prescribing systems were compared with 60 expert panel recommendations for capabilities that would improve patient safety, health outcomes, or patients' costs. Each recommended capability was judged as having been implemented fully, partially, or not at all by each system to which the recommendation applied. Vendors' claims about capabilities were compared with the capabilities found in the site visits.  Results: On average, the systems fully implemented 50% of the recommended capabilities, with individual systems ranging from 26% to 64% implementation. Only 15% of the recommended capabilities were not implemented by any system. Prescribing systems that were part of electronic health records (EHRs) tended to implement more recommendations. Vendors' claims about their systems' capabilities had a 96% sensitivity and a 72% specificity when site visit findings were considered the gold standard.  Conclusions: The commercial electronic prescribing marketplace may not be selecting for capabilities that would most benefit patients.

To examine nursing home demand, focusing on how Medicaid affects demand, the role of economic variables, and on important interactions between explanatory factors. Data Sources. From the 1989 National Long Term Care Survey, a nationally representative sample of community-based and institutionalized elderly persons with disabilities (N = 3,837). Survey data are merged with state- and county-level data on Medicaid policy and local market conditions. Study Design. Sample members are classified as Medicaid-eligible or private pay, were they to enter a nursing home. The probability of being in a nursing home is estimated separately on these two groups using probit. To explore interactions, these subsamples are further divided between married and unmarried persons and between persons with high and low levels of disability. Principal Findings. Demand for nursing home care systematically differs, depending on eligibility for Medicaid. This is attributed in part to the structure of Medicaid benefits. Although economic factors do not appear important to demand decisions in the aggregate, they play a larger role among married persons relative to unmarried persons, and among less disabled persons relative to highly disabled persons. Conclusions. Understanding the nature of nursing home demand requires careful consideration of the different consumption choices people face by virtue of their eligibility for public benefits. Because behavioral responses to changes in policy are found to differ among various groups of disabled persons, policymakers should be sensitive to how these differences affect the efficiency and distributional effects of specific policy changes.",Scholarly Journal1190-AA44,,18,Measuring Recreation Benefits of Quality Improvements with Revealed and Stated Behavior Data,Resource and Energy Economics,0928-7655,"Whitehead, JC; Haab, TC; Huang, JC",10.1016/S0928-7655(00)00023-3,Oct-00,East Carolina University; Ohio State University; University of New Hampshire,East Carolina University,"We propose a combined revealed and stated behavior estimation method to measure recreation benefits of a fixed quality improvement that directly addresses the issues of variation in environmental quality beyond the observed range and new participation induced by higher quality.

But holding company stock is not only risky, it is costly: employees who own company stock are not fully diversified, so expected returns on their portfolios are lower than equally risky, but fully diversified, portfolios. This paper investigates the costs of holding company stock and finds that the loss in diversification reduces the value of employees' holdings significantly. Employees who invest one-quarter of their assets in company stock sacrifice 42 percent of the stock's market value relative to holding a well-diversified equity portfolio.

In addition to deciding which assets to hold, the traditional choice among bonds, stocks, and other investment classes, households with substantial assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts (TDA) must now decide where to hold them. This paper uses data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to assess how many households have enough assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts to face significant asset location choices. It also investigates the asset location decisions these households make. In 2001, 49% of households had at least some assets in a tax-deferred account, and more than 11 million households had at least US$25,000 in both a taxable and a tax-deferred account. Asset allocation inside and outside tax-deferred accounts is quite similar, with about 70% of assets in each location invested in equity securities. Roughly two thirds of households with financial assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts hold portfolios that are tax. efficient. Most of the other third could reduce their taxes by relocating heavily taxed fixed income assets to their tax-deferred account. For more than half of the households that hold apparently tax-inefficient portfolios, however, a shift of less than US$ 10,000 in financial assets would eliminate tax inefficiency.",Scholarly Journal,1210-AB13,,10,Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Brokers in the Mutual Fund Industry,The Review of Financial Studies,0893-9454,"Bergstresser, Daniel B",10.1093/rfs/hhp022,9-Oct,Harvard Business School; University of Oregon; National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard Business School Division of Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Oregon,,Scholarly Journal,1210-AB13,,10,Down or Out: Assessing the Welfare Costs of Household Investment Mistakes,Journal of Political Economy,0022-3808,"Calvert, Laurent E; Campbell, John Y; Sodini, Paolo",10.1086/524204,7-Oct,Imperial College London; HEC Paris; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Stockholm School of Economics; Sveriges Riksbank,Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Bankforskningsinstitutet; HEC Foundation; National Science Foundation; Riksbank; Wallander and Hedelius Foundation,"This paper investigates the efficiency of household investment decisions using comprehensive disaggregated Swedish data.

The investor can hold taxable corporate bonds, tax-exempt municipal bonds, and stocks either in a tax-deferred or a conventional taxable savings account. Taxable bonds have a preferred location in the tax-deferred account and tax-exempt bonds have a preferred location in the taxable account for investors in sufficiently high tax brackets. Tax-efficient stock portfolios (e.g. passively-managed mutual funds) should be held in the taxable account and tax-inefficient stock portfolios (e.g. actively-managed mutual funds) should be held in the tax-deferred account.

This paper analyzes the adequacy and characteristics of the choices offered to 401(k)-plan participants for over 400 plans. We find that only 53% of the plans offer an adequate set of options and that over a 20-year period offering inadequate options makes a difference in terminal wealth of over 53%. We find that funds included in the plans are riskier, but have a slightly higher return, than the general population of funds in the same categories.

Using unique panel data of 401(k) plans in the U.S., we present three principle findings. First, we show that the share of investment options in a particular asset class (i.e., company stock, equities, fixed income, and balanced funds) has a significant effect on aggregate participant portfolio allocations across these asset classes. Second, we document that the vast majority of the new funds added to 401 (k) plans are high-cost actively-managed equity funds, as opposed to lower-cost equity index funds. Third, because the average share of assets invested in low-cost equity index funds declines with an increase in the number of options, average portfolio expenses increase and average portfolio performance is thus depressed.

This study documents the historical trend and recent abuse of annual mutual fund expenses. As the industry becomes more adept at segmenting customers by level of investment sophistication, we claim that load mutual fund companies take advantage of this ability and charge higher expenses to their target customer: the less-knowledgeable investor. No-load fund companies, which tend to attract the more sophisticated investor, offer lower expenses. For example, over 2000-2004 the average annual expense ratio of load equity funds was 50 basis points higher than no-load equity funds. We show evidence of this widening cost disparity since the early 1990s among new and existing equity, bond, and index funds. We also document a growing abuse of sales distribution or 12b-1 fees among funds that are closed to new investors, almost all of which are load funds.

Empirical evidence, however, documents that a large number of investors violate this rule. In this paper, we show that such violations can be optimal for risk-averse investors who face portfolio constraints. In particular, while the strategy of placing bonds in the tax-deferred account maximizes the expected level of tax benefit, it may lead to volatile benefits under different realizations of stock returns. By holding a similar portfolio in both accounts, investors can achieve a more balanced growth in the two accounts, minimize the likelihood of violating the constraints in the future and hence ""smooth"" the volatility of the tax benefit. For some risk-averse investors, this smoothing motive can lead to the observed violation of the pecking order location rule. Our model predicts that such violations are more likely when future tax benefits are more volatile, which can occur, for example, when: (i) the tax rate differential across assets increases over time due either to tax law changes or to tax bracket changes for investors; (ii) asset returns are more volatile; and (iii) investors anticipate large future liquidity needs.",Scholarly Journal,1210-AB13,,10,Manager-Investor Conflicts in Mutual Funds,The Journal of Economic Perspectives,0895-3309,"Mahoney, Paul G",10.1257/0895330041371231,2004,"University of Virginia, Law School",,,Scholarly Journal,1210-AB13,,10,Why Does the Law of One Price Fail?

This article attempts to quantify the benefits that investors enjoy in exchange for the costs of these services. We study broker-sold and direct-sold funds from 1996 to 2004, and fail to find that brokers deliver substantial tangible benefits. Relative to direct-sold funds, broker-sold funds deliver lower risk-adjusted returns, even before subtracting distribution costs. These results hold across fund objectives, with the exception of foreign equity funds. Further, broker-sold funds exhibit no more skill at aggregate-level asset allocation than do funds sold through the direct channel. Our results are consistent with two hypotheses: that brokers deliver substantial intangible benefits that we do not observe and that there are material conflicts of interest between brokers and their clients.

Finally, we find that marginal compensation is lower for advisors of large funds and members of large fund families. We argue that these differences in marginal compensation reflect differences in advisor marginal product, differences in the difficulty of monitoring performance, differences in control environments, and scale economies.

Consumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to be an important determinant of fund flows. High performance appears to be most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower consumers' search costs.

We analyze mutual fund flows over the last 30 years and find negative relations between flows and front- end- load fees. In contrast, we find no relation between operating expenses and flows. Additional analyses indicate that marketing and advertising, the costs of which are often embedded in funds' operating expenses, account for this surprising result.

A striking difference is the shape of the flow-performance relation. In contrast to mutual fund investors, pension clients punish poorly performing managers by withdrawing assets under management and do not flock disproportionately to recent winners. We interpret these and other empirical differences in the context of the manager evaluation procedures typical in each segment. We conclude that pension managers have little incentive to engage in the risk-shifting behavior previously identified among mutual fund managers.

But holding company stock is not only risky, it is costly: employees who own company stock are not fully diversified, so expected returns on their portfolios are lower than equally risky, but fully diversified, portfolios. This paper investigates the costs of holding company stock and finds that the loss in diversification reduces the value of employees' holdings significantly. Employees who invest one-quarter of their assets in company stock sacrifice 42 percent of the stock's market value relative to holding a well-diversified equity portfolio.

In addition to deciding which assets to hold, the traditional choice among bonds, stocks, and other investment classes, households with substantial assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts (TDA) must now decide where to hold them. This paper uses data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to assess how many households have enough assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts to face significant asset location choices. It also investigates the asset location decisions these households make. In 2001, 49% of households had at least some assets in a tax-deferred account, and more than 11 million households had at least US$25,000 in both a taxable and a tax-deferred account. Asset allocation inside and outside tax-deferred accounts is quite similar, with about 70% of assets in each location invested in equity securities. Roughly two thirds of households with financial assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts hold portfolios that are tax. efficient. Most of the other third could reduce their taxes by relocating heavily taxed fixed income assets to their tax-deferred account. For more than half of the households that hold apparently tax-inefficient portfolios, however, a shift of less than US$ 10,000 in financial assets would eliminate tax inefficiency.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Brokers in the Mutual Fund Industry,The Review of Financial Studies,0893-9454,"Bergstresser, Daniel B",10.1093/rfs/hhp022,9-Oct,Harvard Business School; University of Oregon; National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard Business School Division of Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Oregon,,Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Down or Out: Assessing the Welfare Costs of Household Investment Mistakes,Journal of Political Economy,0022-3808,"Calvert, Laurent E; Campbell, John Y; Sodini, Paolo",10.1086/524204,7-Oct,Imperial College London; HEC Paris; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Stockholm School of Economics; Sveriges Riksbank,Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Bankforskningsinstitutet; HEC Foundation; National Science Foundation; Riksbank; Wallander and Hedelius Foundation,"This paper investigates the efficiency of household investment decisions using comprehensive disaggregated Swedish data.

They hold virtually the same securities, yet their returns differ by more than 2 percent per year. Although the relative returns of alternative S&P 500 funds are easily predictable, the relationship between cash flows and performance is weaker than rational behavior would lead us to expect. We show that selecting funds based on low expenses or high past returns outperforms the portfolio of index funds selected by investors. Our results exemplify the fact that, in a market where arbitrage is not possible, dominated products can prosper.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Asset Location in Tax-Deferred and Conventional Savings Accounts,Journal of Public Economics,0047-2727,"Shoven, John B; Sialm, Clemens",10.1016/S0047-2727(02)00083-X,4-Jan,Stanford University; University of Michigan Business School,Kapnick Foundation; Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research,"This paper derives optimal asset allocations (which assets to hold) and asset locations (in which accounts to hold them) for a risk-averse investor saving for retirement. The investor can hold taxable corporate bonds, tax-exempt municipal bonds, and stocks either in a tax-deferred or a conventional taxable savings account. Taxable bonds have a preferred location in the tax-deferred account and tax-exempt bonds have a preferred location in the taxable account for investors in sufficiently high tax brackets. Tax-efficient stock portfolios (e.g. passively-managed mutual funds) should be held in the taxable account and tax-inefficient stock portfolios (e.g. actively-managed mutual funds) should be held in the tax-deferred account. We show that locating assets optimally can significantly improve the risk-adjusted performance of retirement saving.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,The Adequacy of Investment Choices Offered By 401(k) Plans,Journal of Public Economics,0047-2727,"Elton, Edwin J",10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.08.001,6-Aug,Stern School of Business; Fordham University,,"The choices made by 401 (k) participants are the product of two different decisions: what is offered and what is chosen. While there have been a number of studies of the decisions made by participants in 401 (k) plans, there have been no studies of the adequacy of the full set of choices offered to 401(k) participants. This paper analyzes the adequacy and characteristics of the choices offered to 401(k)-plan participants for over 400 plans. We find that only 53% of the plans offer an adequate set of options and that over a 20-year period offering inadequate options makes a difference in terminal wealth of over 53%. We find that funds included in the plans are riskier, but have a slightly higher return, than the general population of funds in the same categories. However, we find that the return difference is roughly equal to the difference in expenses between funds selected by plans and randomly selected funds. We study the characteristics of plans that are associated with adequate investment choices, including an analysis of the use of company stock, plan size, and the use of sophisticated strategies.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,"Out of Sight, Out of Mind, The Effects of Expenses on Mutual Fund Flows",Journal of Business,0021-9398,"Barber, Brad M",10.1086/497042,5-Nov,"University of California, Davis; University of California, Berkeley; University of Michigan",,"We argue that the purchase decisions of mutual fund investors are influenced by salient, attention- grabbing information. Investors are more sensitive to salient, in- your- face fees, like front- end loads and commissions, than operating expenses; they buy funds that attract their attention through exceptional performance, marketing, or advertising. We analyze mutual fund flows over the last 30 years and find negative relations between flows and front- end- load fees. In contrast, we find no relation between operating expenses and flows. Additional analyses indicate that marketing and advertising, the costs of which are often embedded in funds' operating expenses, account for this surprising result.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Individual Account Investment Options and Portfolio Choice: Behavioral Lessons from 401(k) Plans,Journal of Public Economics,0047-2727,"Brown, Jeffrey R; Weisbenner, Scott",10.1016/j.jpubeco.2007.03.012,7-Nov,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Federal Reserve Board,US Social Security Administration,"This paper examines how the menu of investment options made available to workers in defined contribution plans influences portfolio choice. Using unique panel data of 401(k) plans in the U.S., we present three principle findings. First, we show that the share of investment options in a particular asset class (i.e., company stock, equities, fixed income, and balanced funds) has a significant effect on aggregate participant portfolio allocations across these asset classes. Second, we document that the vast majority of the new funds added to 401 (k) plans are high-cost actively-managed equity funds, as opposed to lower-cost equity index funds. Third, because the average share of assets invested in low-cost equity index funds declines with an increase in the number of options, average portfolio expenses increase and average portfolio performance is thus depressed. All of these findings are obtained from a panel data set, enabling us to control for heterogeneity in the investment preferences of workers across firms and across time.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,The Use and Abuse of Mutual Fund Expenses,The Journal of Business Ethics,0167-4544,"Houge, Todd; Wellman, Jay W",10.1007/s10551-006-9077-6,7-Jan,University of Iowa; Binghampton University,,"Prior research shows that mutual fund investors are often aware of up-front charges like sales loads, but they are less mindful of annual operating expenses, even though both types of fees lower overall performance. This study documents the historical trend and recent abuse of annual mutual fund expenses. As the industry becomes more adept at segmenting customers by level of investment sophistication, we claim that load mutual fund companies take advantage of this ability and charge higher expenses to their target customer: the less-knowledgeable investor. No-load fund companies, which tend to attract the more sophisticated investor, offer lower expenses. For example, over 2000-2004 the average annual expense ratio of load equity funds was 50 basis points higher than no-load equity funds. We show evidence of this widening cost disparity since the early 1990s among new and existing equity, bond, and index funds. We also document a growing abuse of sales distribution or 12b-1 fees among funds that are closed to new investors, almost all of which are load funds. Thus, load fund investors are more susceptible to paying higher expenses and receiving lower returns over time.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Are Stocks Desirable in Tax-Deferred Accounts?,Journal of Public Economics,0047-2727,"Garlappi, Lorenzo; Huang, Jennifer C",10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.04.005,6-Dec,University of Texas at Austin,,"Existing literature suggests that, in order to maximize the tax benefit of retirement accounts, investors should follow a ""pecking order"" location rule of placing highly taxed assets (e.g., bonds) in a tax-deferred account and lightly taxed assets (e.g., stocks) in a taxable account. Empirical evidence, however, documents that a large number of investors violate this rule. In this paper, we show that such violations can be optimal for risk-averse investors who face portfolio constraints. In particular, while the strategy of placing bonds in the tax-deferred account maximizes the expected level of tax benefit, it may lead to volatile benefits under different realizations of stock returns. By holding a similar portfolio in both accounts, investors can achieve a more balanced growth in the two accounts, minimize the likelihood of violating the constraints in the future and hence ""smooth"" the volatility of the tax benefit. For some risk-averse investors, this smoothing motive can lead to the observed violation of the pecking order location rule. Our model predicts that such violations are more likely when future tax benefits are more volatile, which can occur, for example, when: (i) the tax rate differential across assets increases over time due either to tax law changes or to tax bracket changes for investors; (ii) asset returns are more volatile; and (iii) investors anticipate large future liquidity needs.",Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Manager-Investor Conflicts in Mutual Funds,The Journal of Economic Perspectives,0895-3309,"Mahoney, Paul G",10.1257/0895330041371231,2004,"University of Virginia, Law School",,,Scholarly Journal,1210-ZA14,,14,Why Does the Law of One Price Fail?

The research results showed the use of mobile cranes with lattice and telescopic booms, truck or crawler mounted, represented over 84% of the fatalities in the use of cranes/derricks. To reduce the rate of crane fatalities the writers believe that crane operators and riggers should be qualified and requalification should occur every 3 years.

Relevant variables are classified as person variables (characteristics of the individual interacting with the warning) and warning variables (characteristics of the warning itself or the context in which the warning appears). This integrative perspective yields general principles about the variables that influence the warning process and serves as a resource for warning developers and as a guide to facilitate effective analysis of warnings.

Patient Educ. Couns. 1998;35:83-8] found that recall of spoken medical instructions averaged 14% but that, when pictographs (drawings representing the instructions) accompanied the spoken instructions and were present during recall, 85% of medical instructions were remembered correctly. Those findings suggested that spoken instructions plus pictographs may be a way to give people with low literacy skills access to medical information that is normally available only in written form. However, there were three important limitations to that study: (1) the subjects were literate and perhaps literate people remember pictograph meanings better than people with low literacy skills; (2) only short term recall was tested and, for medical information to be useful clinically, it must be remembered for significant periods of time and (3) a maximum of 50 instructions were shown in pictographs, whereas managing complex illnesses may require remembering several hundred instructions. This study addresses those limitations by investigating Lt-week recall of 236 medical instructions accompanied by pictographs by people with low literacy skills. Subjects were 21 adult clients of an inner city job training program who had less than fifth grade reading skills. Results showed 85% mean correct recall of pictograph meanings immediately after training (range from 63 to 99%) and 71% after 4 weeks (range from 33 to 94%). These results indicate that people with low literacy skills can, with the help of pictographs, recall large amounts of medical information for significant periods of time.

Method: The effectiveness of three different training conditions to improve comprehension and memory for warning symbols was assessed for younger (18-35 years of age) and older (50-67 years of age) participants. All three conditions paired the symbols with associated text during training; however they differed in the extent to which they further elaborated on the meanings of the symbols. Results: Training substantially improved accuracy and speed of responding on a comprehension test; however there was little difference among conditions. Additionally, while the magnitude of the training effect was similar for both age groups, older participants performed much more poorly than younger participants, both before (37% vs. 52% correct) and after training (68% vs. 88% correct on the immediate post-test), and found it more difficult to reject incorrect meanings (55% vs. 68% correct). Conclusion: Relatively simple training conditions can dramatically improve accuracy and speed of responding to warning symbols. Impact on industry: Training should be used to improve warning symbol comprehension since failures to adequately understand warning information may lead to injury or death. Furthermore, attempts should be made to address individual differences in warning processing such as those related to changes in cognitive processing across the lifespan.",Scholarly Journal1218-AC20,,26,Connotation of hazard for signal words and their associated panels,Applied Ergonomics,0003-6870,"Young, SL",10.1016/S0003-6870(97)00038-0,Apr-98,Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety & Health,,"The present study examined the ability of signal words (e.g. DANGER) and their associated panels to convey hazard-level information, both individually and redundantly, Subjects constructed signs on a computer for 30 different scenarios, The use of signal words and panels was observed as a function of the level of hazard associated with the scenario. The results show that (a) the connoted level of hazard for signal words is not perceived as moat standards suggest, (b) certain panel components (e.g. colour and symbols) are most critical in conveying hazard-level information, (c) no current set of standards or recommendations specifies panel formats which use these panel components optimally, and (d) the use of signal word panels was not necessarily based on the choice of signal word or on the level of hazard for the particular scenario, The results suggest the need for a re-evaluation of current signal word hierarchies.",Scholarly Journal1218-AC20,,26,Current magnitude of occupational disease in the United States.

In some conditions, pictorials, a voice warning, and/or a flashing strobe light were added. The results showed that compliance was significantly greater when the warning was presented in an uncluttered environment compared to a cluttered environment. The presence of a voice warning produced a strong and reliable increase in compliance compared to conditions without a voice warning. No statistically reliable effects of pictorials or strobe were found though the results did show a trend of greater compliance when they were present. In addition, compliance was positively related to memory of the warning, perception of hazard, and reported carefulness. Experiments 2 and 3 directly compared the effect of a posted-sign warning and a within-instructions warning. Results showed that a warning embedded in a set of task instructions produced significantly greater compliance than a similar, larger warning posted as a sign nearby.

The present study examined comprehensibility of a set of safety pictorials, and then employed a training procedure (providing short verbal descriptions of the pictorials) to enhance comprehension and retention. Comprehension was tested for all participants prior to training, and after 1 week. Additionally, comprehension was also tested for some participants immediately following training, and 6 months after training. Also manipulated was the content of instruction (supplying either the pictorial's associated verbal label or verbal label plus a more detailed explanatory statement), and difficulty level ('easy' versus 'difficult' to understand pictorials, as determined by prior research). The results showed that training led to a significant increase in pictorial comprehension. Easy pictorials were comprehended (both initially and following training) better than difficult pictorials, with the latter showing a more dramatic improvement in comprehension following training. Post-training pictorial comprehension was also relatively stable over time. The additional explanatory content statement had no effect on comprehension and recall. The substantial gains in understanding the more difficult pictorials suggest that brief training can substantially facilitate comprehension for pictorials that would otherwise not be readily understood.",Scholarly Journal1218-AC20,,26,"Effectiveness of elevator service signs: Measurement of perceived understandability, willingness to comply and behavior",Applied Ergonomics,0003-6870,"Wogalter, MS; Begley, PB; Scancorelli, LF; Brelsford, JW",10.1016/S0003-6870(96)00063-4,Jun-97,North Carolina State University; Rice University,,"This research examines the effectiveness of four elevator service signs, The signs' purpose is to reduce delays for longer distance riders by dissuading people from using the elevator when they are only going up one floor or down two floors, Three of the four signs were described in Chapanis' (1965, Human Factors 7, 1-17) seminal treatise entitled 'Words, words, words...': an original sign and two others that he suggested as possibly being better, The fourth was an enhanced sign incorporating human factor principles that were derived from research since Chapanis' article, The enhancements involved the use of colour, a signal word panel, icons/pictorial, and direct, explicit wording of the required behaviour, In Experiment 1, participants rated the understandability of each sign and their willingness to obey its instructions, The pattern of the means was the same for both questions, The original sign was rated lowest and the enhanced sign was rated highest, with the two other signs receiving intermediate ratings, In Experiment 2, the signs were placed on each floor of six multi-story buildings adjacent to the elevator call buttons, People's use of the elevators during the posting of each sign and during no-sign (control) periods was measured,The experimenter rode the elevators and counted the total number of passengers using the elevators as well as the number who rode up only one floor or down one or two floors (noncompliers), The new enhanced sign increased compliance compared to the other three signs and the no-sign period, These results suggest that design principles derived from recent research can help to promote comprehension, motivation and compliance behaviour to signs.",Scholarly Journal1218-AC20,,26,The efficacy of material safety data sheets and worker acceptability,Journal of Safety Research,0022-4375,"Phillips, CC; Wallace, BC; Hamilton, CB; Pursley, RT; Petty, GC; Bayne, CK",10.1016/S0022-4375(99)00005-5,1999,"Office of Safety and Health Protection, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Tennessee; Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory",,"This study quantified how well the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) diffused information to workers, compared the efficacy of an OSHA type form with the Chemical Manufacturer's Association/American National Standards Institute (CMA/ANSI Z400.1) structure and the International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC), and determined worker acceptability and understanding of MSDSs at a large national laboratory.

Two alternative (tag and fold-out) designs were developed to increase the available surface area on a fictitious prescription drug label. The alternative label designs, with and without pictorials depicting instructions and warnings, were compared to a standard control label. In Expt. 1, 84 undergraduates rated the labels on several preference dimensions, including: ease of reading the labels, likelihood of noticing the warnings? likelihood of reading the warnings, preference for each of the labels, and likelihood that they would recommend each label for use by a friend or family member.

Design: Aggregation and analysis of national and large regional data sets collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Council on Compensation Insurance, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Health Care Financing Administration, Methods: To assess incidence of and mortality from occupational injuries and illnesses, we reviewed data from national surveys and applied an attributable risk proportion method. To assess costs, we used the human capital method that decomposes costs into direct categories such as medical and insurance administration expenses as well as indirect categories such as lost earnings, lost home production, and lost fringe benefits. Some cost estimates were drawn from the literature while others were generated within this study. Total costs were calculated by multiplying average costs by the number of injuries and illnesses in each diagnostic category. Results: Approximately 6500 job-related deaths from injury, 13.2 million nonfatal injuries, 60 300 deaths from disease, and 862 200 illnesses are estimated to occur annually in the civilian American workforce. The total direct ($65 billion) plus indirect ($106 billion) costs were estimated to be $171 billion. Injuries cost. $145 billion and illnesses $26 billion. These estimates are likely to be low, because they ignore costs associated with pain and suffering as well as those of within-home care provided by family members, and because the numbers of occupational injuries and illnesses are likely to be undercounted. Conclusions: The costs of occupational injuries and illnesses are high, in sharp contrast to the limited public attention and societal resources devoted to their prevention and amelioration. Occupational injuries and illnesses are an insufficiently appreciated contributor to the total burden of health care costs in the United States.",Scholarly Journal,1218-AC20,,26,Association of colors with warning signal words,International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,0169-8141,"Griffith, LJ; Leonard, SD",10.1016/S0169-8141(96)00062-5,Oct-97,University of Georgia,,Colors are used in warning messages in combination with signal words to attract the attention of users and to communicate to them the risk in using a product.

The experiments using semantic differential and free-association techniques reported here obtained responses from 261 college students regarding the relative effects of colors as signals of risk. The use of signal colors in the combinations suggested by various standards organizations was not well supported by the data. Suggestions for alternative approaches were made.

One manufacturer provided no language about any respiratory effects of TDI exposure. Asthma was listed as a potential health effect by only 15 of the 30 manufacturers (50%). Listing asthma in the MSDS was associated with higher toluene diisocyanate concentrations In the product (P <.042), Allergic or sensitizing respiratory reactions were listed by 21 manufacturers (70%), CONCLUSIONS: Many MSDSs for toluene diisocyanate do not communicate clearly that exposure can cause or exacerbate asthma.

Previous findings concerning the importance of the signal word were supported. When signs were seen singly there was no tendency for versions with components missing to be rated as poorer, Only when all versions were seen together was the 'full' version ranked as being better, a result which is taken as reflecting the demand characteristics of the method, The results argue against strict adherence to a formula requiring specified components in a sign.

Separate studies revealed a high level of agreement in signal word arousal strengths derived from magnitude estimation, category estimation, and cross-modality matching. In addition, the relative arousal strengths of signal words were shown to be independent of the composition of the warning stimulus set. These findings suggest that arousal strength scales of signal words are robust and that signal words can be used with confidence to achieve hazard matching between the hazard inherent in a product/situation and the hazard implied by the associated warning.",Scholarly Journal,1218-AC20,,26,Analysis of the level of comprehension of chemical hazard labels: A case for Zambia,Science of the Total Environment,0048-9697,"Banda, SF; Sichilongo, K",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.10.011,6-Jun,"University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia",United Nations Institute for Training and Research; the Netherlands Government,"We have surveyed the impact of chemical hazard label elements on four target sectors, i.e. the agricultural, industrial, transport and the consumer (the general public) sectors, in order to assess the type of reactions the respondents perceive to a given chemical label element such as symbol, hazard phrase, color, and hazard signal word. The survey revealed that the level of education, gender and/or age did not influence the respondents' perception of the extent of hazard but rather familiarity or frequency of use of the chemicals and acquaintance with chemical label elements was significant in the assessment of the extent of perceived hazard posed by a given chemical. Symbols such as the St Andrews Cross-though common-is virtually not understood by more than 80% of the respondents in all the sectors. We noted that respondents appreciate symbols they can relate to, which are flame-like, ghost-like and exert immediate impacts to respondents.

The values of reducing the risks from two diseases, a nerve disease (peripheral neuropathy) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system), are measured in terms of both trade-off rates with the risk of an automobile death and with dollars.While the use of reference lotteries for monetary outcomes to establish a utility metric is well established for monetary outcomes, our results suggest that reference lotteries on life and death can also be applied with decision-makers facing realistic choices to construct a utility metric for valuing health status.

This is a serious mistake. The very theory that underlies current practice calls for far more individuation of the relevant values. According to that theory, VSL should vary across risks. More controversially, VSL should vary across individuals-even or especially if the result would be to produce a lower number for some people than for others. One practical implication is that a higher value should be given to programs that reduce cancer risks. Another is that government should use a higher VSL for programs that disproportionately benefit the wealthy-and a lower VSL for programs that disproportionately benefit the poor. But there are two serious complications here. First, bounded rationality raises problems for the use of private willingness to pay, which underlies current calculations of VSL. Second, the beneficiaries of regulation sometimes pay only a fraction or even none of its cost; when this is so, the appropriate VSL for poor people might be higher, on distributional grounds, than market evidence suggests. An understanding of this point has implications for foundational issues about government regulation, including valuation of persons in poor and wealthy nations.

We discuss various econometric problems associated with the hedonic wage approach, namely the instability of the estimates to specification changes, unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find evidence of significant compensating wage differentials and Values of a Statistical Life (VSL) figures only under the most restrictive assumptions, i.e. when we assume that there is no unobserved heterogeneity and that all regressors are exogenous. However, the VSL values are large and vary dramatically with the inclusion or exclusion of industry and/or occupation dummies, as well as with the addition of nonfatal risk. When we specify models that allow for heterogeneity and endogeneity of risk and of other regressors, we find no evidence of compensating wage differentials. We conclude that if compensating differentials for risk exists, econometric problems and the changing nature of labour markets prevent us from observing them. We also conclude that models and techniques for panel data that account for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity present a completely different picture about compensating wage differentials than that inferred by most wage-risk studies, which have generally used single cross-sections of data.

Design and Methods: Direct care workers from 50 skilled nursing facilities, 39 home care agencies, 40 assisted living facilities, and 10 adult day services in five states completed a paper survey administered prior to the implementation of the BJBC interventions in each organization. We include direct care workers (n = 3,039) with complete data in the analyses using multinomial regression clustered by provider organization to compare those not at all likely to leave and those very likely to leave in the next year with a middle referent group who are somewhat likely to leave. Results: Logistic regression results were that work overload and lack of upward mobility increased intent to leave. Respondents with positive assessments of their supervisor, who valued helping others, and for whom the income was perceived as rewarding were less likely to be in the very likely to quit category and more likely to be in the stable category. Some differences between provider types are observed, especially between home care workers and those employed in facilities. Implications: These findings provide support for many of the management-practice improvements taking place in the field, including those implemented in the BJBC demonstration.

Government social policies and funding created home care, shaping the structure of the industry and the conditions of work. The welfare nexus, linking old age, disability, health, and welfare policies, however, also transformed care hidden in the home into a public service. Through case studies of California and Oregon, leaders in deinstitutionalizing care of the elderly and disabled, we explore the social struggles that forced the state to recognize its invisible workforce. The home location of personal attendants and other health aides has entailed not only organizing challenges but policy innovation as well. Using the welfare state location of the labor workers allied with consumers to develop the public authority as a new structure of representation.

Methods: Responses from 10 793 Americans participating in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) were used to evaluate workers' job histories, work schedules, and occurrence of occupational injury and illness between 1987 and 2000. A total of 110 236 job records were analysed, encompassing 89 729 person-years of accumulated working time. Aggregated incidence rates in each of five exposure categories were calculated for each NLSY survey period. Multivariate analytical techniques were used to estimate the relative risk of long working hours per day, extended hours per week, long commute times, and overtime schedules on reporting a work related injury or illness, after adjusting for age, gender, occupation, industry, and region. Results: After adjusting for those factors, working in jobs with overtime schedules was associated with a 61% higher injury hazard rate compared to jobs without overtime. Working at least 12 hours per day was associated with a 37% increased hazard rate and working at least 60 hours per week was associated with a 23% increased hazard rate. A strong dose-response effect was observed, with the injury rate ( per 100 accumulated worker-years in a particular schedule) increasing in correspondence to the number of hours per day ( or per week) in the workers' customary schedule. Conclusions: Results suggest that job schedules with long working hours are not more risky merely because they are concentrated in inherently hazardous industries or occupations, or because people working long hours spend more total time ""at risk"" for a work injury. Strategies to prevent work injuries should consider changes in scheduling practices, job redesign, and health protection programmes for people working in jobs involving overtime and extended hours.",Scholarly Journal,1235-AA05,,9,The association between continuity of care and outcomes: a systematic and critical review,Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice,1356-1294,"van Walraven, C; Oake, N; Jennings, A; Forster, AJ",10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01235.x,10-Oct,"University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute",,"Background: Numerous studies have tried to determine the association between continuity and outcomes.

Objective: To identify and summarize all methodologically studies that measure the association between continuity of care and patient outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE database (1950-2008) and hand-searched to identify studies that tried to associate continuity and outcomes. English studies were included if they: actually measured continuity; determined the association of continuity with patient outcomes; and properly accounted for the relative timing of continuity and outcome measures. Results: A total of 139 English language studies tried to measure the association between continuity and outcomes but only 18 studies (12.9%) met methodological criteria. All but two studies measured provider continuity and used health utilization or patient satisfaction as the outcome. Eight of nine high-quality studies found a significant association between increased continuity and decreased health utilization including hospitalization and emergency visits. Five of seven studies found improved patient satisfaction with increased continuity. Conclusions: These studies validate the belief that increased provider continuity is associated with improved patient outcomes and satisfaction.

The analysis uses actual data on hours, wages, and benefits at current and subsequent jobs and controls for perceived rewards and work conditions, personal characteristics, and local labor market conditions. Results: Although the analysis finds that improved work conditions and non-pecuniary rewards of home-based direct care work have significant negative effects on turnover intentions, compensation accounts for more actual job turnover. Higher wages, more hours, and travel cost reimbursement are found to be significantly associated with reduced turnover. Although wages and hours appear to have stronger effects, health benefits do appear to have some significance in predicting job-to-job transitions.

Tenure (77% of injuries occurred after 1 year of tenure) was significantly correlated with training, satisfaction, organizational climate, and stress. Because of the chronic nature of musculoskeletal disorders, tenure was used to choose cases for injury prediction using logistic regression.

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Design and Setting.-Descriptive epidemiologic study of all persons injured by the bombing and of all at-risk occupants of the federal building and 4 adjacent buildings. Data were gathered from hospital emergency and medical records departments, medical examiner records. and surveys of area physicians. building occupants, and survivors. Study Population.-All persons known to have been exposed to the blast. Main Outcome Measures.-Characteristics of fatalities and injuries, injury maps, and injury rates by building location. Results.-A total of 759 persons sustained injuries. 167 persons died. 83 survivors were hospitalized, and 509 persons were treated as outpatients, Of the 361 persons who were in the federal building, 319 (88%) were injured, of whom 163 (45%) died. including 19 children. Persons in the collapsed part of the federal building were significantly more likely to die (153/175, 87%) than those in other parts of the building (10/186, 5%) (risk ratio [RR], 16.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9-29.8). In 4 adjacent buildings, injury rates varied from 38% to 100%; 3 persons in these buildings and 1 person in an outdoor location died. The mast frequent cause of death was multiple injuries. Among survivors, soft tissue injuries, fractures, sprains, strains, and head injuries were most common: these injuries were most often caused by flying glass and other debris and collapsed ceilings. Conclusions.-The Oklahoma City bombing resulted in the largest number of fatalities of any terrorist act in the United Stales, and there were 4 times as many nonfatal injuries as fatalities, Disaster management plans should include the possibility of terrorist bombing, and medical preparedness should anticipate that most injuries will be nonfatal, The role of building collapse in fatal injuries and the role of glass and other flying debris in minor to moderate injuries should be considered in the design of buildings at high risk of being bombed so as to reduce injuries.",Scholarly Journal,Journal of American Medical Association1601-AA52,,6,Using Probabilistic Terrorism Risk Modeling for Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis: Application to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Implemented in the Land Environment,Risk Analysis,0272-4332,"Latourrette, T.; Willis, H.H.",10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01022.x,7-May,RAND Corporation,US Customs and Border Protection,"This article presents a framework for using probabilistic terrorism risk modeling in regulatory analysis. We demonstrate the framework with an example application involving a regulation under consideration, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for the Land Environment, (WHTI-L). First, we estimate annualized loss from terrorist attacks with the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) Probabilistic Terrorism Model. We then estimate the critical risk reduction, which is the risk-reducing effectiveness of WHTI-L needed for its benefit, in terms of reduced terrorism loss in the United States, to exceed its cost. Our analysis indicates that the critical risk reduction depends strongly not only on uncertainties in the terrorism risk level, but also on uncertainty in the cost of regulation and how casualties are monetized. For a terrorism risk level based on the RMS standard risk estimate, the baseline regulatory cost estimate for WHTI-L, and a range of casualty cost estimates based on the willingness-to-pay approach, our estimate for the expected annualized loss from terrorism ranges from $2.7 billion to $5.2 billion. For this range in annualized loss, the critical risk reduction for WHTI-L ranges from 7% to 13%. Basing results on a lower risk level that results in halving the annualized terrorism loss would double the critical risk reduction (14-26%), and basing the results on a higher risk level that results in a doubling of the annualized terrorism loss would cut the critical risk reduction in half (3.5-6.6%). Ideally, decisions about terrorism security regulations and policies would be informed by true benefit-cost analyses in which the estimated benefits are compared to costs. Such analyses for terrorism security efforts face substantial impediments stemming from the great uncertainty in the terrorist threat and the very low recurrence interval for large attacks. Several approaches can be used to estimate how a terrorism security program or regulation reduces the distribution of risks it is intended to manage. But, continued research to develop additional tools and data is necessary to support application of these approaches. These include refinement of models and simulations, engagement of subject matter experts, implementation of program evaluation, and estimating the costs of casualties from terrorism events.",Scholarly Journal,Previously unpublished work was published in April 2008 in Risk Analysis1601-AA52,,6,Ammmonium Nitrate use in London Bombing Campaign,http://www.gsa.gov/portal/gsa/ep/contentview.do?contenttype=gsa basic&contentid=11807&noc=t ,,,,,,,,,1625-AA32,,3,Grain News 2,US Grains Council,,,,,,,,Article,1625-AA32,,3,Indigenous Peoples Update,Great Lakes Aquatic Habitat News,,"Maybee, M",,2001,,,,Article,1625-AA32,,3,The Economics of Controlling a Biological Invasion,Washington Post,,"Olson, LJ;

Of the approximately 60 unintentionally introduced species with a known invasion history, 38 are transoceanic (including 19 Atlantic species of American origin) and 18 of Ponto-Caspian origin. Species that have caused economic damage to fisheries, shipping, and industry include the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia, the barnacle Balanus improvisus, the cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi, and the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha.

Dietary overlaps decreased and niche breadth increased for all species but the endemic splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus in fall when mysid populations were low. Eight native species exhibited lower overall collective overlaps and fuller stomachs than five alien species, suggesting more efficient resource partitioning. After mysid abundance declined, only alien striped bass Morone saxatilis preyed upon mysids in greater than trace amounts. An alien mysid became an important prey for small striped bass, but striped bass also switched to piscivory at a smaller size than when mysids were abundant. Eight of 13 species exhibited significant declines in abundance during the study period, which were concordant with the original importance of mysids in their diets.

The economic impacts of zebra mussels have not been examined in detail since the mid-1990s. The purpose of this study was to quantify the annual and cumulative economic impact of zebra mussels on surface water-dependent drinking water treatment and electric power generation facilities (where previous research indicated the greatest impacts). The study time frame was from the first full year after discovery in North America (Lake St. Clair, 1989) to the present (2004); the study area was throughout the mussels' North American range. A mail survey resulted in a response rate of 31% for electric power companies and 41% for drinking water treatment plants. Telephone interviews with a sample of nonrespondents assessed nonresponse bias; only one difference was found and adjusted for. Over one-third (37%) of surveyed facilities reported finding zebra mussels in the facility and almost half (45%) have initiated preventive measures to prevent zebra mussels from entering the facility operations. Almost all surveyed facilities (91%) with zebra mussels have used control or mitigation alternatives to remove or control zebra mussels. We estimated that 36% of surveyed facilities experienced an economic impact. Expanding the sample to the population of the study area, we estimated $267 million (BCa 95% CI = $161 million-$467 million) in total economic costs for electric generation and water treatment facilities through late 2004, since 1989. Annual costs were greater ($44,000/facility) during the early years of zebra mussel infestation than in recent years ($30,000).

We focused on the origin, probable mechanism(s) of introduction, and the date and locality of first discovery of Great Lakes exotic species. The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to invasion by exotic species since settlement of the region by Europeans. Since the 1800s, 139 non-indigenous aquatic organisms have become established in the Great Lakes. The bulk of these organisms has been represented by plants (59), fishes (25), algae (24), and mollusks (14). Most species are native to Eurasia (55%) and the Atlantic Coast (13%). As human activity has increased in the Great Lakes watershed, the rate of introduction of exotic species has increased. Almost one-third of the organisms have been introduced in the past 30 years, a surge coinciding with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. Five categories of entry mechanisms were identified: unintentional releases, ship-related introductions, deliberate releases, entry through or along canals, and movement along railroads and highways. Entry mechanisms were dominated by unintentional releases (29%) and ships (29%). Unintentional releases included escapees from cultivation and aquaculture, bait, aquarium, and other accidental releases. Ship-related introductions included ballast water (63%), solid ballast (31%), and fouling. Introductions via canals represent a small percentage of entries into the Great Lakes. We have identified 13 non-indigenous species (9%) that have substantially influenced the Great Lakes ecosystem, both economically and ecologically. The apparent lack of effects of 91% of the exotic species in the Great Lakes does not mean that they have had little or no ecological impact. Alterations in community structure may predate modern investigations by decades or centuries, and the effects of many species have simply not been studied. As long as human activities provide the means through which future species can be transported into the Great Lakes basin, the largest freshwater resource in the world will continue to be at risk from the invasion of exotic organisms.",Scholarly Journal1625-AA32,,3,Fouling and ship's hulls: how changing circumstances and spawning events may result in exotic species spread,Biofouling,0892-7014,"Minchin, D; Gollasch, S",10.1080/0892701021000057891,3-Apr,"Marine Organism Investigations, Ballina, Killaloe, Ireland; GoConsult, Hamburg, Germany",German Environmental Protection Agency,"Organisms fouling ships' hulls are continually in transit worldwide. Although effective antifouling paints incorporating organotins have considerably reduced fouling biomass these paints have a limited period of effectiveness, which may be less than the ships' inter-docking period, depending on sea temperature and abrasion. Vessels immersed over several years can allow fouling communities to develop and spread beyond their native distribution. This process of establishment is not fully understood. This review proposes that short rapid turnaround of vessels with mature attached biota can result in synchronized spawnings and production of sufficient zygotes to form a founder population. Spawning may be induced by changes in temperature or salinity on entry into a port, according to season. The diversity of taxa. in transit on ships' hulls includes commercial molluscs, which have the potential to transmit their diseases or pests to port regions. Several factors may act in the further enhancement of exotic species establishment including changes of in-port berthing regions to more marine conditions. Ships today are generally larger, and faster, and have a high frequency of port visits thereby increasing the number of spawning opportunities, perhaps with a larger inoculum size. With trade expansion, new trading routes, political events and changes in climate, new pathways for invasion will emerge. Greater controls on industrial discharges, improved treatments of urban wastes and better management of waste runoff into rivers as well as a phasing out of organotin antifoulants will mean a reduced toxicity in port regions. This may enable a smaller inoculum to colonize by creating opportunities for establishment not present in the previous 25 years.

However, evidence for biotic resistance in aquatic ecosystems is equivocal. Contrary to the view that communities become more resistant to invasion as they accumulate species, the rate of invasion has increased over the past century in areas that have received frequent shipping traffic. Furthermore, introduced species may facilitate, rather than compete with, one another. A review of invasions in the Great Lakes indicates that direct positive (mutualistic and commensal) interactions among introduced species are more common than purely negative (competitive and amensal) interactions. In addition, many exploitative (e.g., predator-prey) interactions appear to be strongly asymmetric in benefiting one invading species at a negligible cost to another. These observations, combined with an increasing invasion rate in the Great Lakes, tentatively support the Simberloff - Von Holle ""invasional meltdown"" model. The model posits that ecosystems become more easily invaded as the cumulative number of species introductions increases, and that facilitative interactions can exacerbate the impact of invaders. It provides a theoretical argument for substantially reducing the rate of species introductions to the Great Lakes.",Scholarly Journal1625-AA32,,3,Using an Economic Model of Recreational Fishing to Evaluate the Benefits of Sea Lamprey Control on the St. Mary's River,Journal of Great Lakes Research,0380-1330,"Lupi, F; Hoehn, JP; Christie, GC",,2003,Michigan State University; Great Lakes Fishery Commission,Great Lakes Fishery Commission; Michigan Sea Grant College Program; Michigan Department of Natural Resources; Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station,"This paper describes efforts to estimate economic benefits of improved sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinas) suppression on the St. Marys River.

Previous economic efforts to evaluate sea lamprey control have taken a basin-wide view to determine optimal steady-state control levels based on economic injury levels, or have focused on whether or not the entire sea lamprey treatment program is justified. While capable of being adapted to either of these types of evaluations, the method presented here was used to estimate benefits to Michigan anglers of several sea lamprey treatments options for the St. Marys River. When estimated benefits are compared to treatment costs, all treatment options examined are shown to have different, but positive, net present value.

In our samples from eight coastal locations in central California collected between June 1993 and May 1994, we found no green crabs at the two closest embayments south of San Francisco Bay and found the crabs in all four embayments sampled within 120 km north of San Francisco Bay, up to and including Bodega Harbor. C. maenas was not present in samples from sites farther north. This northward range expansion is apparently the result of larval recruitment by a single cohort, corresponding to the predominant northern transport of surface waters and the approximate distance water moves during larval green crab development. At Bodega Harbor, the current northern range limit, the C. maenas population is now well established lished and reproducing. Females and males became sexually mature within their first year at similar or equal to 40 mm carapace width, molting approximately monthly from summer through fall, and females were ovigerous in late fall of their first year at similar or equal to 50 mm. We expect larvae from this population to recruit locally and to the north, promoting episodic range extensions as new populations are established and b reproduce.

We investigated methods for modifying commercial production of Manila clams in order to reduce losses to green crab predation. In both 1997 and 1998, the timing of the outplant of seed clams was varied such that one portion of the total clam production was outplanted early in the year (March) and another portion outplanted later in the year (August/September). In July and August 2000, we examined these bags outplanted in 1997 and 1998 and quantified the clam mortality and the abundance of crabs including green crabs. We tested the effects of both year of transfer (1997 vs. 1998) and the timing of transfer (early season vs. late season) on clam and crab abundance and found significantly (p < 0.05) fewer green crabs and less predation on Manila clams in bags that were outplanted in the late season. Year of outplant also influenced clam survival and green crab abundance, such that delayed outplant significantly (p < 0.05) increased clam survival only when green crab abundances were high (1997). Our data suggest that the increased Manila clam survival in delayed outplant bags was likely due to reduced green crab recruitment and consequently lower green crab predation. We conducted additional experiments on relative predation rates by green crabs on Manila clams, We found that green crab predation is strongly size dependent, and that while juvenile green crabs were not effective predators of market size Manila clams (> 36 mm in width). these clams were easily consumed by adult green crabs (> 50 mm carapace width).

A plausible scenario for their successful introduction and establishment in Australian waters is: (1) ballast water intake during seasonal plankton blooms and to a lesser extent via resuspended cysts in sediments from Japanese or Korean ports; (2) survival as resistant resting cysts during the ballasting process, the voyage in a dark ballast tank, and subsequent ballast water discharge (inoculation); (3) successful germination of cysts, sustained growth and reproduction of plankton cells in an Australian port; and (4) further spreading via coastal currents or domestic shipping, culminating under suitable environmental conditions in harmful algal blooms impacting on aquacultural operations (causative organisms of paralytic shellfish poisoning).

About half of the ballast water carried into the Seaway by ocean-going vessels and lakers each year originates from the St. Lawrence River, portions of which are not yet protected by any ballast controls.",Scholarly Journal,1625-AA32,,3,Bang for the Buck: Cost-Effective Control of Invasive Species with Different Life Histories ,Ecological Economics,0921-8009,"Buhle, E; Margolis, M; Ruesink, JL",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.07.018,15-Feb-05,University of Washington; Resources for the Future,National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration,"Strategies for controlling invasive species can be aimed at any or all of the stages in the life cycle. In this paper, we show how to combine biological data on population dynamics with simple economic data on control costs options to determine the least costly set of strategies that will prevent an established invader from continuing to increase. Based on biological data alone (elasticities of matrix population models), effective control strategies are sensitive to both life history and rate of population growth. Adding economic considerations, however, can cause the optimal control strategy to shift, unless the costs of intervention are the same across life stages. As an example, we apply our methods to oyster drills (Ocinebrellus inornatus), an economically important aquaculture pest that has been accidentally introduced worldwide. Control efforts are applied to local tidelands through manual removal of adults, although the life history characteristics of the species indicate a low population elasticity for adult survival. Aquaculturists are making bioeconomic decisions to remove adults vs. egg capsules, because of the relative ease of controlling each stage.",Scholarly Journal,1625-AA32,,3,Ballast-mediated animal introductions in the Laurentian Great Lakes: retrospective and prospective analyses,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences ,0706-652X,"Grigorovich, IA; Colautti, RI; Mills, EL; Holeck, K; Ballert, AG; MacIsaac, HJ",10.1139/F03-053,3-Jun,"University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada; Cornell Biological Field Station; Great Lakes Commission",Great Lakes Fishery Commission; Premier's Research Excellence Award Program; Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research,"Since completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, at least 43 nonindigenous species (NIS) of animals and protists have established in the Laurentian Great Lakes, of which similar to67% were attributed to discharge of ballast water from commercial ships. Twenty-three NIS were first discovered in four ""hotspot"" areas with a high representation of NIS, most notably the Lake Huron - Lake Erie corridor. Despite implementation of the voluntary (1989, Canada) and mandatory (1993, U.S.A.) ballast water exchange (BWE) regulations, NIS were discovered at a higher rate during the 1990s than in the preceding three decades. Here we integrate knowledge of species' invasion histories, shipping traffic patterns, and physicochemical factors that constrain species' survivorship during ballast-mediated transfer to assess the risk of future introductions to the Great Lakes. Our risk-assessment model identified 26 high-risk species that are likely to survive intercontinental transfer in ballast tanks. Of these, 10 species have already invaded the Great Lakes. An additional 37 lower-risk species, of which six have already invaded, show some but not all attributes needed for successful introduction under current BWE management.

In this paper we review existing invasion models, most of which were developed to describe invasions of terrestrial habitats, and propose an alternative that explores long-distance invasions mediated by discharge of contaminated ballast water by ships inbound to the Great Lakes. Based on current knowledge of shipping traffic to the Great Lakes, our model predicts that mid-ocean exchange of ballast water lowers propagule delivery by approximately three to four orders of magnitude relative to unexchanged ballast water. Propagule pressure of individual ships that enter the Great Lakes loaded with cargo and that declare ""no ballast on board"" (NOBOB) is typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of vessels that exchange ballast. Because NOBOB vessels dominate (similar to90%) inbound traffic into the Great Lakes, these vessels collectively appear to pose the greatest risk of new introductions, even though their individual risks are low.",Scholarly Journal,1625-AA32,,3,"REMARKABLE INVASION OF SAN-FRANCISCO BAY (CALIFORNIA, USA) BY THE ASIAN CLAM POTAMOCORBULA-AMURENSIS .2.

During sequential stages of ballast transfer (uptake, transport, and release), the density and diversity of the plankton assemblage is selectively filtered, determining the pool of potential invaders. Understanding taxon-specific patterns of mortality along the invasion pathway is key to understanding and predicting successful invasions. We quantified taxon-specific trends in plankton mortality during a 16 d trans-Atlantic ballast water voyage. In the ballast tanks, we collected a miminum of 50 live taxa. Over 50 % of taxa and > 98% of organisms collected in initial samples were not detected at the end of the voyage. No ballasted organisms survived experimental transfer to coastal harbor water. We suggest that the invasion success of a particular taxon may be predicted both by high density at the end of a voyage (which is comparatively easy to measure) and by low mortality during a voyage (which may indicate good body condition, but is harder to measure). These 2 predictors were not, however, correlated across taxa. Mid-ocean exchange, the most widely used method for reducing ballast-mediated invasion risk, alters the pool of potential invaders. In an experimental test of mid-ocean exchange, 93 to 100 % of the coastal water and 80 to 100 % of the coastal organisms were removed. However, the total density and diversity of plankton in the ballast tanks increased significantly following exchange and in laboratory experiments ocean water was not lethal to coastal organisms.",Scholarly Journal,1625-AA32,,3,Ecological Roulette: The Global Transport of Nonindigenous Marine Organisms,Science,0036-8075,"Carlton, JT; Geller, JB",,1993,"Williams College; University of North Carolina, Wilmington",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Ocean-going ships carry, as ballast, seawater that is taken on in port and released at subsequent ports of call.

Framework: Leadership influence is conceptualized as flowing along four paths (Rational, Emotions, Organizational, and Family) toward student learning. Each path is populated by multiple variables with more or less powerful effects on student learning. Leaders increase student learning by improving the condition or status of selected variables on the Paths. Research Methods: Evidence includes teacher responses to an online survey (1,445 responses) measuring distributed leadership practices in their schools (N = 199) and variables mediating leaders' effects on students. Grade 3 and 6 math and literacy achievement data were provided by the province's annual testing program. The 2006 Canadian Census data provided a composite measure of school socioeconomic status. Path modeling techniques were used to test six hypotheses. Results: The Four Paths model as a whole explains 43% of the variation in student achievement. Variables on the Rational, Emotions, and Family Paths explain similarly significant amounts of that variation. Variables on the Organizational Path were unrelated to student achievement. Leadership had its greatest influence on the Organizational Path and least influence on the Family Path. Implications: School leaders and leadership researchers should be guided much more directly by existing evidence about school, classroom, and family variables with powerful effects on student learning as they make their school improvement and research design decisions.",Scholarly Journal,1904-AA90,,1,Designing Environmental Policy: Lessons from the Regulation of Mercury Emissions,Journal of Regulatory Economics,0922-680X,"Gayer, T; Hahn, RW",10.1007/s11149-006-9005-9,1-Oct-09,Georgetown University; AEI-Brookings Joint Center,,"In its waning days, the Clinton administration decided that it was appropriate to regulate mercury emissions from power plants.

The second was to establish a cap on mercury emissions while allowing emissions trading in order to reduce the cost of achieving the goal. This paper presents the first cost-benefit analysis of this issue that takes account of IQ benefits. We find that the benefits of the mercury regulation are likely to fall short of the cost. This assessment is based on a number of assumptions that are highly uncertain. The finding of negative net benefits is robust to many, though not all, reasonable variations in the model assumptions.

The Review's second basic strand is a more intuitive argument that it might be very important to avoid possibly large uncertainties that are difficult to quantify. Concerning this uncertainty aspect, I argue that it might be recast into sound analytical reasoning that might justify some of the Review's conclusions. The basic issue here is that spending money to slow global warming should perhaps not be conceptualized primarily as being about consumption smoothing as much as being about how much insurance to buy to offset the small change of a ruinous catastrophe that is difficult to compensate by ordinary savings.",Scholarly Journal,1904-AA90,,1,Applying Cost Analyses to Drive Policy that Protects Children,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,0077-8923,"Trasande, L; Schechter, C; Haynes, KA; Landrigan, PJ",10.1196/annals.1371.034,2006,Mount Sinai School of Medicine; Albert Einstein College of Medicine,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Jenifer Altman Foundation; Physicians for Social Responsibility; Rena Shulsky Foundation,"Exposure in prenatal life to methylmercury (MeHg) has become the topic of intense debate in the United States after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal in 2004 to reverse strict controls on emissions of mercury from coal-fired power plants that had been in effect for the preceding 15 years. This proposal failed to incorporate any consideration of the health impacts on children that would result from increased mercury emissions. We assessed the impact on children's health of industrial mercury emissions and found that between 316,588 and 637,233 babies are born with mercury-related losses of cognitive function ranging from 0.2 to 5.13 points. We calculated that decreased economic productivity resulting from diminished intelligence over a lifetime results in an aggregate economic cost in each annual birth cohort of $8.7 billion annually (range: $0.7-$13.9 billion, 2000 dollars). $1.3 billion (range: $51 million-$2.0 billion) of this cost is attributable to mercury emitted from American coal-fired power plants. Downward shifts in intellectual quotient (IQ) are also associated with 1566 (range: 115-2675) excess cases of mental retardation (MR defined as IQ < 70) annually. This number accounts for 3.2% (range: 0.2-5.4%) of MR cases in the United States. If the lifetime excess cost of a case of MR (excluding individual productivity losses) is $1,248,648 in 2000 dollars, then the cost of these excess cases of MR is $2.0 billion annually (range: $143 million-$3.3 billion). Preliminary data suggest that more stringent mercury policy options would prevent thousands of cases of MR and billions of dollars over the next 25 years.",Scholarly Journal,1904-AA92,,4,2007 RS Means Electrical Cost Data ,"R.S.

The incoming Bush administration had to decide how best to regulate these emissions. The Bush administration offered two approaches for regulating mercury emissions from power plants. The first was to establish uniform emission rates across utilities, as mandated by the 1990 Amendments. The second was to establish a cap on mercury emissions while allowing emissions trading in order to reduce the cost of achieving the goal. This paper presents the first cost-benefit analysis of this issue that takes account of IQ benefits. We find that the benefits of the mercury regulation are likely to fall short of the cost. This assessment is based on a number of assumptions that are highly uncertain. The finding of negative net benefits is robust to many, though not all, reasonable variations in the model assumptions. We also find that the emissions trading proposal is roughly $15 billion less expensive than the command-and-control proposal.",Scholarly Journal,,1904-AB59,,19,Applying Cost Analyses to Drive Policy that Protects Children,Living in a Chemical World: Framing the Future in Light of the Past,0077-8923,"Trasande, Leonardo; Schechter, Clyde; Haynes, Karla A; Landrigan Philip J",10.1196/annals.1371.034,2006,Mount Sinai School of Medicine; Albert Einstein College of Medicine,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Jenifer Altman Foundation; Physicians for Social Responsibility; Rena Shulsky Foundation,"Exposure in prenatal life to methylmercury (MeHg) has become the topic of intense debate in the United States after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal in 2004 to reverse strict controls on emissions of mercury from coal-fired power plants that had been in effect for the preceding 15 years.

The energy savings that can be obtained by delivering refrigeration at the higher temperature as required by the fresh food compartment is found to be a function of the cabinet load ratio (defined as the ratio of the fresh food to the freezer cabinet loads) and the ratio of the freezer and refrigerator cycle COPs. Depending on the values of these two parameters, the energy requirement for a dual-cycle * system can be up to 30% lower than that for a comparable single-cycle ** system meeting the same cabinet loads. This energy-saving approach can help manufacturers meet the Department of Energy's year 2001 energy use standards for domestic refrigerators. The dual-cycle system also offers the advantages of reduced defrost (not included in the previously mentioned energy savings estimate) and the ability to maintain higher humidity conditions in the fresh food compartment. The feasibility of using the fresh food compartment as a sink to subcool liquid refrigerant prior to its entry into the freezer capillary tube was also investigated. The advantage of the subcooler was found to be most significant at low cabinet load ratios in dual cycles for which suction-line heat exchangers were not present. When high-effectiveness suction-line heat exchangers in the fresh food and the freezer cycles were employed, a maximum reduction of 3% in total electrical power requirements at a cabinet load ratio of 1.0 resulted from the indirect mechanical subcooling modification.* Stand-alone independent refrigeration cycles for both the fresh food compartment and the frozen food compartment.** A single refrigeration cycle that provides refrigeration to both the frezer and the fresh food compartments while operating at the freezer temperature.",Scholarly Journal,1904-AB79,,4,Performance of Carbon Black-Containing Polyurethane Foam in Domestic Refrigerators,Journal of Cellular Plastics,0021-955X,"Pisipati, JS; Godbey, JA",,March-April 1996,Bayer Corp.; Center for Applied Engineering,,"The North American appliance industry has been challenged to meet stringent federal standards for energy consumption using CFC alternatives, which generally increase thermal conductivity of a foam. After a period of evaluating several options, the industry has, for the most part, settled on hydrochlorofluorocarbon, HCFC-141b, as a substitute for CFC-11. Studies have shown that appliance foam systems using carbon black in conjunction with HCFC-141b lower k-factors by 6-9% both in panels and in cabinets.Recent efforts in this area have demonstrated that this approach not only lowers k-factors but can provide benefits to reduce energy consumption of refrigerator cabinets.Preliminary evaluation of carbon black-containing foams based on HCFC-141b had shown that the material processed well in cabinets and had no effect on linear appearance. No modifications to the foam processing equipment was necessary.

During cyclingoperation the refrigerator was found to operate between 5 and 25% less efficient then the corresponding quasisteadymachine. The cycling refrigerator operates with an evaporator capacity between 3 and 17% less than thequasi-steady refrigerator, while at the same time requiring between 1 and 9% more power to operate.This refrigerator performance degradation was attributed to several factors, the most important being therefrigerant migration and the thermal mass of the evaporator and compressor. During the off-cycle refrigerantmigrates from the condenser to the evaporator as the system pressures equalize. The off-cycle migration increasesthe temperature of the evaporator and necessitates refrigerant redistribution during the on-cycle, and thereby tendsto reduce system performance. The increased power requirements, traced to the compressor, result from slightdifferences in system pressure and the reduced compressor efficiency due to a cool compressor.With the cycling losses identified, several possible refrigerator design changes were suggested. It appearsthat a refrigerator equipped with a reciprocating compressor, solenoid valves to isolate the condenser, and noaccumulator should operate in a nearly quasi-steady manner. In addition using the condenser fan to acceleratecharge redistribution was investigated. However, since the experimental refrigerator was equipped with anaccumulator which held up some charge manipulating the condenser fan showed little payoff.",Scholarly Journal,Cant find DOI,1904-AB79,,4,Designing Environmental Policy: Lessons from the Regulation of Mercury Emissions,Journal of Regulatory Economics,0922-680X,"Gayer, T; Hahn, RW",10.1007/s11149-006-9005-9,6-Nov,Georgetown University; AEI-Brookings Joint Center,,"In its waning days, the Clinton administration decided that it was appropriate to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. The incoming Bush administration had to decide how best to regulate these emissions. The Bush administration offered two approaches for regulating mercury emissions from power plants. The first was to establish uniform emission rates across utilities, as mandated by the 1990 Amendments. The second was to establish a cap on mercury emissions while allowing emissions trading in order to reduce the cost of achieving the goal. This paper presents the first cost-benefit analysis of this issue that takes account of IQ benefits. We find that the benefits of the mercury regulation are likely to fall short of the cost. This assessment is based on a number of assumptions that are highly uncertain. The finding of negative net benefits is robust to many, though not all, reasonable variations in the model assumptions. We also find that the emissions trading proposal is roughly $15 billion less expensive than the command-and-control proposal.

Some of the designs are from the applied patents and some are from the recent literatures. The fin patterns include interrupted surfaces, enhanced wavy and the vortex generators. Benefits and the associated constraints of these designs are discussed. To effectively improve the heat transfer performance, asymmetric designs offer some promising features in the advanced fin patterns. Moreover, concave depression such as cavity design show significant advantages over conventional interrupted fin surfaces. It is recommended that further detailed examinations on the relevant concepts either via numerical simulation or experimental implementation are carried out in the future to gain further insight into the designs.Read More: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2010132511000624",Scholarly Journal,,1904-AB79,,4,Testing of propane/isobutane mixture in domestic refrigerators,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DU FROID,0140-7007,"Jung, D; Kim, CB; Song, K; Park, B",10.1016/S0140-7007(99)00084-5,Nov-00,"Inha University, Inchon, South Korea",Inha University; Samsung Electronics Company,"The performance of a proyane/isobutane (R290/R600a) mixture was examined for domestic refrigerators. A thermodynamic cycle analysis indicated that the propane/isobutane mixture in the composition range of 0.2 to 0.6 mass fraction of propane yields an increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) of up to 2.3% as compared to CFC12. For the actual tests, two commercial refrigerators of 299 and 465 I were used. For both units, all refrigeration components remained the same throughout the tests, except that the length of the capillary tube and amount of charge were changed for the mixture. Each refrigerator was fully instrumented with more than 20 thermocouples, two pressure transducers, and a digital watt/watt-h meter, For each unit, both 'energy consumption test' and 'no load pull-down test' were conducted under the same condition. The experimental results obtained with the same compressor indicated that the propane/isobutane mixture at 0.6 mass fraction of propane has a 3-4% higher energy efficiency and a somewhat faster cooling rate than CFC12. The mixture showed a shorter compressor on-time and lower compressor dome temperatures than CFC12. In conclusion, the proposed hydrocarbon mixture seems to be an appropriate long term candidate to replace CFC12/WFC134a from the viewpoint of energy conservation requiring minimal changes in the existing refrigerators.

Laboratory tests of energy use are typically used to measure a refrigerator's energy consumption. Three different test procedures are widely used: the US Department of Energy, the International Standards Organization test, and the Japanese Industrial Standard. The features of the tests are compared and conversion factors reviewed. The DOE test is likely to yield the highest consumption of the three procedures. A critical factor is the relationship between a refrigerator's laboratory-based energy use and its consumption in a kitchen. The DOE test is the most carefully validated with field data. The DOE test, on average, over-predicts actual consumption in US homes by about 10%, but there is wide variation in field use for identical units. The factors affecting variation in energy use are reviewed. The ambient temperature in the kitchen is by far the most significant factor, while door openings and humidity are relatively minor. Field measurements suggest that maintenance measures, such as coil cleaning and gasket replacement, save little energy. Replacement of old refrigerators with new, efficient models often cuts refrigerator energy use by 60%. Significant reductions in refrigerator electricity use can be expected during the next decade in the US and Europe.

This proposal failed to incorporate any consideration of the health impacts on children that would result from increased mercury emissions.

Therefore, it is important to understand the development and growth of these markets. Following a pioneering study by Bass (1969), diffusion models have traditionally provided this understanding in marketing. The great appeal of the Bass model is that it is a simple one that fits the data very well and provides parameters that have an intuitive behavioural interpretation. The model suffers from three well-known limitations: (1) it does not include marketing variables that could influence new product diffusion and sales; (2) the model's parameters are unstable; and (3) the model's forecasts are inaccurate before the sales peak and especially prior to the point of inflection. Subsequent research has made progress especially in extending the Bass model to include marketing variables. However, the extensions have come at the cost of simplicity: the new models are far more complex than the simple Bass model. We propose an alternate simple model of new product growth for consumer durables, based on the concept of affordability rather than on diffusion. We compare this model with the diffusion model in terms of fit, stability and validity of parameters, and forecasting ability. The alternate model is a little inferior to the diffusion model in fit, but superior in terms of the stability and validity of parameters and forecasting ability. We discuss the limitations and implications of our model. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These forced flow, multiple finned evaporators are preferred in the local industry over the older roll-bonded designs due to efficiency and cost considerations. Extensive testing was done, and experimental data were gathered on evaporators of three different sizes at three airflow rates using a closed-loop test rig built for the purpose. This has led to the development of a novel approach of measuring low air velocities as encountered in domestic refrigerators. A correlation has been developed for the heat transfer performance of these evaporators following the j-Colburn factor analysis. The correlation relates the j-Colburn factor, a nondimensional heat transfer grouping of the Nusselt number, Reynolds number, and Prandtl number to the Reynolds number and finning factor.

The used propane/butane mixture is liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which is locally available and comprises 24.4% propane, 56.4% butane and 17.2% isobutane. The LPG is cheap and possesses an environmentally friendly nature with no ozone depletion potential (ODP). It is used in Jordan for cooking purposes. The refrigerator used in the present study is of medium size with a gross capacity of 3201 and is designed to work on CFC 12. The performance parameters investigated are the refrigeration capacity, the compressor power and the coefficient of performance (COP). The refrigerator worked efficiently when LPG was used as refrigerant instead of CFC 12. The evaporator temperature reached -15 degrees C with COP value of 3.4 at a condenser temperature of 27 degrees C and an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C. The refrigerator has been working satisfactorily since March 1994 without noticing any side effects or needing any adjustments.

However, gains in the efficiency of energy consumption will result in an effective reduction in the per unit price of energy services. As a result, consumption of energy services should increase (i,e., ""rebound"" or ""take-back""), partially offsetting the impact of the efficiency gain in fuel use. Definitions of the ""rebound"" effect vary in the literature and among researchers. Depending on the boundaries used for the effect, the size or magnitude of this behavioral response may vary. This review of some of the relevant literature from the US offers definitions and identifies sources including direct, secondary, and economy-wide sources. We then offer a summary of the available empirical evidence for the effect for various sources. For the energy end uses for which studies are available, we conclude that the range of estimates for the size of the rebound effect is very low to moderate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that such observational estimates of climate sensitivity can be tightened if reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past several centuries are considered. We use large-ensemble energy balance modelling and simulate the temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing to determine which climate sensitivities yield simulations that are in agreement with proxy reconstructions. After accounting for the uncertainty in reconstructions and estimates of past external forcing, we find an independent estimate of climate sensitivity that is very similar to those from instrumental data.

Within the framework of our single-model ensemble experiment, we show that climate sensitivity of much greater than 6 degrees C is hard to reconcile with the paleoclimate record, and that of greater than 8 degrees C seems virtually impossible. Our estimate for the most likely climate sensitivity is in the region of 4.5 degrees C. Although these results are reasonably consistent with the most widely accepted estimates of climate sensitivity, they disagree with some recent research which has suggested a significant probability of sensitivities well in excess of these values.

This paper surveys the literature by focusing on alternative explanations of the dominant stylized fact: that the usage of new technologies over time typically follows an S-curve. The most commonly found model which is used to account for this model is the so-called epidemic model, which builds on the premise that what limits the speed of usage is the lack of information available about the new technology, how to use it and what it does. The leading alternate model is often called the probit model, which follows from the premise that different firms, with different goals and abilities, are likely to want to adopt the new technology at different times. In this model, diffusion occurs as firms of different types gradually adopt it. There are actually many ways to generate an S-curve, and the third class of models which we examine are models of density dependence popularized by population ecologists. In these models, the twin forces of legitimation and competition help to establish new technologies and then ultimately limit their take-up. Finally, we look at models in which the initial choice between different variants of the new technology affect the subsequent diffusion speed of the chosen technology.

Uncertainty in climate sensitivity is a main source of uncertainty in projections of future climate change. Here we present a new approach for constraining this key uncertainty by combining ensemble simulations of the last glacial maximum (LGM) with paleo-data. For this purpose we used a climate model of intermediate complexity to perform a large set of equilibrium runs for (1) pre-industrial boundary conditions, (2) doubled CO(2) concentrations, and (3) a complete set of glacial forcings (including dust and vegetation changes). Using proxy-data from the LGM at low and high latitudes we constrain the set of realistic model versions and thus climate sensitivity. We show that irrespective of uncertainties in model parameters and feedback strengths, in our model a close link exists between the simulated warming due to a doubling of CO(2), and the cooling obtained for the LGM. Our results agree with recent studies that annual mean data-constraints from present day climate prove to not rule out climate sensitivities above the widely assumed sensitivity range of 1.5-4.5 degrees C (Houghton et al. 2001). Based on our inferred close relationship between past and future temperature evolution, our study suggests that paleo-climatic data can help to reduce uncertainty in future climate projections.

We develop a model based on standard economic assumptions and argue that this is indeed the case. Standard preferences-of the kind used widely in economics to study consumption, asset pricing, and labor supply-imply that health spending is a superior good with an income elasticity well above one. As people get richer and consumption rises, the marginal utility of consumption falls rapidly. Spending on health to extend life allows individuals to purchase additional periods of utility. The marginal utility of life extension does not decline. As a result, the optimal composition of total spending shifts toward health, and the health share grows along with income.

If DeltaT(2x) is less than the lower bound given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 1.5 degreesC, then AICC may not be a serious problem for humanity. If DeltaT(2x) is greater than the upper bound given by the IPCC, 4.5 degreesC, then AICC may be one of the most severe problems of the 21st century. Here we use a simple climate/ocean model, the observed near-surface temperature record, and a bootstrap technique to objectively estimate the probability density function for DeltaT(2x). We find that as a result of natural variability and uncertainty in the climatic radiative forcing, the 90% confidence interval for DeltaT(2x) is 1.0 degreesC to 9.3 degreesC.

Paleobotanical, paleopedologic, and oxygen isotope studies indicate high temperatures during the PETM and sharp declines in precipitation compared with late Paleocene estimates. Insect and oligochaete burrows increase in abundance during the PETM, suggesting longer periods of soil development and improved drainage conditions. Crayfish burrows and molluscan body fossils, abundant below and above the PETM interval, are significantly less abundant during the PETM, likely because of drier floodplain conditions and lower water tables. Burrow diameters of the most abundant ichnofossils are 30-46% smaller within the PETM interval. As burrow size is a proxy for body size, significant reductions in burrow diameter suggest that their tracemakers were smaller bodied. Smaller body sizes may have resulted from higher subsurface temperatures, lower soil moisture conditions, or nutritionally deficient vegetation in the high-CO(2) atmosphere inferred for the PETM. Smaller soil fauna co-occur with dwarf mammal taxa during the PETM; thus, a common forcing mechanism may have selected for small size in both above-and below-ground terrestrial communities. We predict that soil fauna have already shown reductions in size over the last 150 years of increased atmospheric CO(2) and surface temperatures or that they will exhibit this pattern over the next century. We retrodict also that soil fauna across the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic boundary events show significant size decreases because of similar forcing mechanisms driven by rapid global warming.",Scholarly Journal1904-AC04,,7,Environment and evolution through the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum,Trends in Ecology & Evolution,0169-5347,"Gingerich, PD",10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.006,6-May,University of Michigan,National Science Foundation,"The modern orders of mammals, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Primates (APP taxa), first appear in the fossil record at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, c. 55 million years ago.

The choices researchers make with respect to these unknown properties play a crucial role in conditioning their climate forecasts. We show that any probabilistic estimate of climate sensitivity, and hence of the risk that a given greenhouse gas stabilisation level might result in a ""dangerous'' equilibrium warming, is critically dependent on subjective prior assumptions of the investigators, not simply on constraints provided by actual climate observations. This apparent arbitrariness can be resolved by focussing on the intended purpose of the forecast: while uncertainty in long-term equilibrium warming remains high, an objectively determined 10 - 90% ( 5 - 95%) range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is relevant to forecasts of 21st century transient warming under nearly all current emission scenarios is 1.4 - 4.1 degrees C with a median of 2.4 degrees C, in good agreement with the ""traditional'' range.",Scholarly Journal1904-AC04,,7,The climate sensitivity and its components diagnosed from Earth radiation budget data,Journal of Climate,0894-8755,"Forster, PMD; Gregory, JM",10.1175/JCLI3611.1,6-Jan,"University of Reading, Reading, UK; Met Office, Exeter, UK",,"One of the major uncertainties in the ability to predict future climate change, and hence its impacts, is the lack of knowledge of the earth's climate sensitivity. Here, data are combined from the 1985-96 Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) with surface temperature change information and estimates of radiative forcing to diagnose the climate sensitivity. Importantly, the estimate is completely independent of climate model results. A climate feedback parameter of 2.3 +/- 1.4 W m(-2) K-1 is found. This corresponds to a 1.0-4.1-K range for the equilibrium warming due to a doubling of carbon dioxide (assuming Gaussian errors in observable parameters, which is approximately equivalent to a uniform ""prior"" in feedback parameter). The uncertainty range is due to a combination of the short time period for the analysis as well as uncertainties in the surface temperature time series and radiative forcing time series, mostly the former. Radiative forcings may not all be fully accounted for; however, all argument is presented that the estimate of climate sensitivity is still likely to be representative of longer-term climate change. The methodology can be used to 1) retrieve shortwave and longwave components of climate feedback and 2) suggest clear-sky and cloud feedback terms.

First we characterize climate uncertainty by constructing two probability density functions-a Bayesian model-averaged and a Bayesian updated version-based on a combination of uncertainty ranges for climate sensitivity reported in the scientific literature. Next we estimate the willingness to pay of a representative agent for a range of emissions reduction policies using two simplified economic models. Our results illustrate the potential for large risk premiums in benefits estimates as suggested by the recent theoretical work on climate response uncertainty, and they show that the size and even the sign of the risk premium may depend crucially on how the posterior distribution describing the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty is constructed and on the specific shape of the damage function.",Scholarly Journal1904-AC04,,7,The economics of climate change,American Economic Review ,0002-8282,"Stern, N",10.1257/aer.98.2.1,8-May,World Bank,,,Scholarly Journal1904-AC04,,7,A review of the The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change,Journal of Economic Literature,0022-0515,"Nordhaus, WD",10.1257/jel.45.3.686,7-Sep,Yale University,,"How much and how fast should we react to the threat of global warming?

While the distance from the site of the dam removal is statistically significant and negative in the legit willingness-to-pay equation, benefits per household fall off slowly and the extent of the market is nationwide. With a majority of households living outside the immediate area of the dam, the rest of the US households reflect 97% of the national benefits for dam removal and salmon restoration.

Even the lower bound benefit estimates exceed the high estimate of water leasing costs ($1.13 million) and conservation reserve program farmland easements costs ($12.3 million) necessary to produce the increase in ecosystem services.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,"Metropolitan-Specific Estimates of the Price Elasticity of Supply of Housing, and Their Sources",American Economic Review,0002-8282 ,"Green, R; Malpezzi, S; Mayo, S",10.1257/000282805774670077,5-May,George Washington University; University of Wisconsin; Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,,,Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,On approximating the statistical properties of elasticities,Review of Economics and Statistics,0034-6535,"Krinsky, I; Robb, AL",10.2307/2109761,Feb-90,McMaster University,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Arts Research Board, McMaster University",,Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,Economic Fundamentals in Local Housing Markets: Evidence from U.S. Metropolitan Regions,Journal of Regional Science,0022-4146,"Hwang, Min; Quigley, John M",10.1111/j.1467-9787.2006.00480.x,6-Aug,"National University of Singapore, Singapore; University of California, Berkeley",,"This paper investigates the effects of national and regional economic conditions on outcomes in the single-family housing market: housing prices, vacancies, and residential construction activity. Our three-equation model confirms the importance of changes in regional economic conditions, income, and employment on local housing markets. The results also provide the first detailed evidence on the importance of vacancies in the owner-occupied housing market on housing prices and supplier activities. The results also document the importance of variations in materials, labor and capital costs, and regulation in affecting new supply. Simulation exercises, using standard impulse response models, document the lags in market responses to exogenous shocks and the variations arising from differences in local parameters.

The method assumes a specific form for preferences and uses available benefit information to identify, and calibrate the preference parameters to match the existing benefit estimates. This approach assures economic consistence of the transfers. Benefit measures can. never be inconsistent with household income. The logic also offers a series of potentially observable ""predictions"" that can be used to gauge the plausibility of benefit transfers. When multiple benefit estimates from different methods are available such as hedonic property value, travel cost demand, and contingent valuation, the framework uses the definition of the benefit concept from each method in a single preference function to reconcile differences. It provides a specific way to take account of baseline conditions and scope effects (i.e., the size of the proposed change) consistently in the transfer. The method is illustrated using estimates for benefit measure changes in water quality from three studies: travel cost demand, hedonic property value, and contingent valuation analysis.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,"Measurement, Generalization, and Publication: Sources of Error in Benefit Transfers and Their Management",Ecological Economics,0921-8009,"Rosenberger, Randall S; Stanley, Tom D",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.03.018,6-Dec,Oregon State University; Hendrix College,,"Convergent validity tests of benefit transfer accuracy show errors to range from a few percentage points to 100% and more. This paper discusses three potential sources of errors that affect the accuracy of benefit transfers. (1) The measurement of values is subject to random errors and the caprices that arise from the many judgments and technical assumptions required by the researchers who conduct the primary studies. Measurement error occurs when researchers' decisions affect the transferability of measures of value or as the result of sampling. (2) Generalization error occurs when a measure of value is generalized to unstudied sites or resources. Generalization error is inversely related to the correspondence between study sites and policy sites. (3) Publication selection bias occurs when the objectives for publishing research limit benefit transfer applications of research outcomes. Criteria for selecting which research results are published may be at odds with the needs of benefit transfer practitioners. Several means for overcoming these sources of error are offered: standardized application of tested methods; closer adherence to benefit transfer protocol; the establishment of an e-journal with explicit criteria for fully recording, reporting, and disseminating research, which has the primary objective of estimating empirical measures of value.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,The Accuracy of Owner-Provided House Values: the 1978-1991 American Housing Survey,Real Estate Economics,1080-8620,"Kiel, K; Zabel J",10.1111/1540-6229.00774,1999,The College of Holy Cross; Tufts University,,"The American Housing Survey (AHS) includes the owner's valuation of the house as a measure of the house's value. If owner-stated values are accurate, the AHS (as well as other survey instruments) can be used by researchers studying a variety of topics. In this study we use the metropolitan version of the AHS for three cities over fourteen years to compare owners' valuations with sales prices of houses that sold in the twelve months prior to an interview. We find that, on average, recent buyers report house values that are 8.4% higher than the stated sales prices. Further analysis indicates that these recent buyers, when compared with owners with longer tenure, overvalue their houses by 3.3%, on average. Thus, we find that the average owner overvalues his house by 5.1%. Also, differences between sales prices and owners' valuations are not related to particular characteristics of the house, occupants (other than length of tenure), or neighborhood. Thus,the use of the owners' Valuations will result in accurate estimates of house price indexes and will provide reliable estimates of the prices of house and neighborhood characteristics.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,"The value of clean water: the public's willingness to pay for boatable, fishable, and swimmable quality water",Water Resources Research,0043-1397,"Carson, RT; Mitchell; RC",10.1029/93WR00495,Jul-93,"University of California, San Diego; Clark University",US Environmental Protection Agency,"This paper presents the findings of a study designed to determine the national benefits of freshwater pollution control. By using data from a national contingent valuation survey, we estimate the aggregate benefits of meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act. A valuation function is estimated which depicts willingness to pay as a function of water quality, income, and other variables. Several validation checks and tests for specific biases are performed, and the benefit estimates are corrected for missing and invalid responses. The two major policy implications from our work are that the benefits and costs of water pollution control efforts are roughly equal and that many of the new policy actions necessary to ensure that all water bodies reach at least a swimmable quality level will not have positive net benefits.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE91,,12,Systematic Variation in Willingness to Pay for Aquatic Resource Improvements and Implications for Benefit Transfer: A Meta-Analysis,Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics,0008-3976,"Johnston, RJ; Besedin, EY; Iovanna, R; Miller, CJ; Wardwell, RF; Ranson, MH",10.1111/j.1744-7976.2005.04018.x,June-Sept 2005,"University of Connecticut; Abt Associates, Inc.; US Environmental Protection Agency; US Department of Agriculture",US Environmental Protection Agency,"Researchers are increasingly considering benefit transfer approaches that allow welfare measures to be adjusted for characteristics of the policy context.

In this study we illustrate how these issues can be addressed efficiently within a Bayesian meta-regression framework. We find that the Bayesian model, in contrast to its classical counterpart, can estimate a relatively large set of parameters, including indicators of unobserved study heterogeneity, with reasonable accuracy even when the underlying meta-sample is small.

Despite the sizable literature and the ubiquity of benefit transfer in policy analysis, the method remains subject to controversy. There is also a divergence between transfer practices recommended by the scholarly literature and those commonly applied within policy analysis. The size, complexity and relative disorganization of the literature may represent an obstacle to the use of updated methods by practitioners. Recognizing the importance of benefit transfer for policymaking and the breadth of associated scholarly work, this paper reviews and synthesizes the benefit transfer literature. It highlights methods, trends and controversies in contemporary research, identifies issues and challenges facing benefit transfer practitioners and summarizes research contributions.

The resultant availability of welfare estimates for different scales and regions provides numerous avenues for benefit transfer. This paper provides a systematic assessment of transfer error, contrasting different methods for the tran, fer of farmland preservation values across states and jurisdictional scales. Results drawn from multistate choice experiments suggest that the choice of across scale versus across state transfer method can have significant implications for transfer validity.

Increasingly researchers and practitioners are estimating mixed logit models of various degrees of sophistication with mixtures of revealed preference and stated choice data. It is timely to review progress in model estimation since the learning curve is steep and the unwary are likely to fall into a chasm if not careful. These chasms are very deep indeed given the complexity of the mixed logit model. Although the theory is relatively clear, estimation and data issues are far from clear. Indeed there is a great deal of potential mis-inference consequent on trying to extract increased behavioural realism from data that are often not able to comply with the demands of mixed logit models. Possibly for the first time we now have an estimation method that requires extremely high quality data if the analyst wishes to take advantage of the extended behavioural capabilities of such models. This paper focuses on the new opportunities offered by mixed logit models and some issues to be aware of to avoid misuse of such advanced discrete choice methods by the practitioner.",Scholarly Journal2040-AE95,,14,Labeling Genetically Modified Food: Heterogeneous Consumer Preferences and the Value of Information,Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics 53(1): 83-102,0008-3976,"Hu, W.; Veeman, M.M.; Adamowicz, W.L.",,2005,"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada",Genome Canada; Genome Prairie; Alberta Agricultural Research Institute,"One facet of public debate associated with genetically modified (GM) food focuses on labelling policy for products derived from GM processes. This paper reports on the analysis of effects on consumers' choices of pre-packaged sliced bread under different GM food labelling policies. Substantial heterogeneity is found to exist among consumers' tastes for various bread attributes, including the presence/absence of GM ingredients in bread products. A simulation-based bias-adjusted measure is applied to estimate the value of information, as opposed to the value of the presence or absence of GM ingredients, revealed to consumers by different labelling procedures for the GM attribute. The information that is provided in a mandatory labelling context is considerably more valued by consumers than the information provided in a voluntary labelling context. In a final section, estimated consumer benefits from labelling policies are expressed in terms of average market prices for bread products, providing a measure of benefits against which potential cost increases that may be associated with labelling policies may be compared in the context of any future benefit-cost analysis of GM labelling",Scholarly Journal2040-AE95,,14,"Willingness to Pay for Agricultural Land Preservation and Policy ProcessAttributes: Does the Method Matter?",American Journal of Agricultural Economics 89(4): 1098-1115,0002-9092 ,"Johnston, R.J.; Duke, J.M.",10.1111/j.1467-8276.2007.01029.x,2007,University of Connecticut; University of Delaware,"National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture","This article examines relationships between willingness to pay for land preservation and policy process attributes.

Results indicate policy process attributes may influence utility in some circumstances, even after controlling for the influence of land use outcomes often correlated with specific policy techniques.

In particular we highlight the fact that in certain study designs the choice set initially offered (or ""visible"") to respondents is changed in a stepwise manner as they progress through a valuation exercise, while other designs involve advance disclosure regarding the full extent of the final visible choice set prior to any choices or values being elicited. The issue of changes in the visible choice set is alluded to by Smith (J. Environ. Econom. Manage. 22(1) 71), who identifies this as a primary challenge to Kahneman and Knetsch's (J. Environ. Econom. Manage. 22(1) 57), well-known experimental results. Kahneman and Knetsch contend that it seems ""highly implausible that this minor procedural change would significantly alter results"" (p. 61), but do not test this assertion. We present experimental and field tests of the impact upon contingent values of varying the visible choice set through stepwise and advance disclosure. These dimensions of design are interacted with changes in the order in which nested goods are presented (bottom-up versus top-down). When a stepwise disclosure procedure is adopted, the observed scope sensitivity is substantially and significantly affected by the order in which goods are presented but such procedural variance is not observed within advance disclosure designs. Conjectures regarding the origin and implications of such findings are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We use a computer-based survey approach to elicit choices among residential locations that pose different risks of chronic disease and dying in an automobile accident. From paired choices between different locations, we infer their rates of trade-off between reducing the risks of chronic diseases and the automobile death risk. The values of reducing the risks from two diseases, a nerve disease (peripheral neuropathy) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system), are measured in terms of both trade-off rates with the risk of an automobile death and with dollars.While the use of reference lotteries for monetary outcomes to establish a utility metric is well established for monetary outcomes, our results suggest that reference lotteries on life and death can also be applied with decision-makers facing realistic choices to construct a utility metric for valuing health status. The results were corroborated by a strong positive correlation between the risk-risk trade-off values and relative aversion scores for the different health outcomes, as well as by the relative values of avoiding the three diseases in our study.

The reduction of cancer risk may occur shortly after the reduced exposure or after a considerable period of time. The time of risk reduction associated with exposure reduction will vary by compound. Some recommended measures of the economic benefits associated with environmental regulations are sensitive to the timing of the risk reductions and cannot be effectively addressed by the conventional dose-response procedures. This paper introduces the concept and methodologies for calculating cessation lag effects, with the specific goal of answering the following questions: (1) How many cancer cases are avoided at age t after cessation (or reduction) of exposure concentration? and (2) How long does the effect of an exposure last after exposure has terminated (or been reduced)? The proposed procedures do not require more information than what is required by the conventional dose-response procedures for which cumulative or an averaged lifetime exposure is used.

This paper examines how each of these factors influences the magnitude of the $/ton estimate. We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.

Although there are very many different studies in this field which sometimes appear to arrive at contradictory results, we find that with proper stratification of studies by model and data type much of the conflict turns to consensus. In this survey we classify studies by data type and by ten different categories of model and with the exception of estimates on seasonal data, which tend to be unstable, and of certain inappropriate model formulations, we find a fair degree of agreement concerning average short-run and even long-run income and price elasticities.

To evaluate the probability that a specific degree of exposure will produce an adverse effect, risk assessment methods must be used. This paper reviews much of the published information and evaluates the various risk assessments for benzene that have been conducted over the past 20 years. There is sufficient evidence that chronic exposure to relatively high concentrations of benzene can produce an increased incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Some studies have indicated that benzene may cause other leukemias, but due to the inconsistency of results, the evidence is not conclusive. To predict the leukemogenic risk for humans exposed to much lower doses of benzene than those observed in most epidemiology studies, a model must be used. Although several models could yield plausible results, to date most risk assessments have used the linear-quadratic or conditional logistic models. These appear to be the most appropriate ones for providing the cancer risk for airborne concentrations of 1 ppb to 10 ppm, the range most often observed in the community and workplace. Of the seven major epidemiology studies that have been conducted, there is a consensus that the Pliofilm cohort (rubber workers) is the best one for estimating the cancer potency because it is the only one with good exposure and incidence of disease data. The current EPB, OSHA, and ACGIH cancer potency estimates for benzene are based largely on this cohort. A retrospective exposure assessment and an analysis of the incidence of disease in these workers were completed in 1991. All of these issues are discussed and the implications evaluated in this paper. The range of benzene exposures to which Americans are commonly exposed and the current regulatory criteria are also presented.

The purpose of this paper is to identify a theoretical explanation for these patterns of pricing behavior, and to look for evidence consistent with the theory by examining market structure, conduct, and spatial pricing patterns in different retail gasoline markets in Canada. The study utilizes a novel source of price data: price observations reported to internet data collection sites. The firm and station specific price data are consistent with the presence of tacitly collusive behavior in one retail gasoline market and the presence of maverick retailers that prevent tacit collusion in the other retail market.

They related these price sensitivities to a comprehensive set of demographic and competitor variables that described the trading areas of each of the stores. Despite the inability of previous research to find much of a relationship between consumer characteristics and price sensitivity, 11 demographic and competitive variables explain on average 67% of the variation in price response. Moreover, the authors found that the consumer demographic variables are much more influential than competitive variables. Their findings open the possibility for more effective everyday and promotional pricing strategies that exploit store-level differences in price sensitivity.

We exploit this variation, using direct measures of regulation and plant data, to estimate employment effects of sharply increased air quality regulation in Los Angeles. Regulations were accompanied by large reductions in NOx emissions and induced large abatement investments for refineries. Nevertheless, we find no evidence that local air quality regulation substantially reduced employment, even when allowing for induced plant exit and dissuaded plant entry. Regulations affected employment only slightly - partly because regulated plants are in capital and not labor-intensive industries. These findings are robust to the choice of comparison regions.

Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.

Regulatory effort varies by county attainment status and state attitudes. A switch from attainment to nonattainment status induces greater local regulatory effort, leading to air quality improvement, ceteris paribus, and an exit of polluting industries. Polluting industries spread out, moving from nonattainment (polluted) to attainment (initially less polluted) areas. Localities can improve hourly extreme-value reading which trigger regulatory activity, without improving measures of typical conditions (for example, daily medians), by spreading economic activity over the day to dampen daily ozone peaks.",Scholarly Journal,Can't Find DOI2060-AM44,2060-AR13,8,Jobs versus the Environment: An Industry-Level Perspective,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,0095-0696,"Morgenstern, RD; Pizer, WA; Shih, JS",10.1006/jeem.2001.1191,2-May,"Center for Economic Studies, US Bureau of the Census",,"The possibility that workers could he adversely affected by increasingly stringent environmental policies has led to claims of a ""jobs versus the environment"" trade-off by both business and labor leaders, The present research examines this claim at the industry level for four heavily polluting industries: pulp and paper mills, plastic manufacturers, petroleum refiners, and iron and steel mills. Combining a unique plant-level data set with industry-level demand information, we find that increased environmental spending generally does not cause a significant change in employment. Our average across all four industries is a net gain of 1.5 jobs per $1 million in additional environmental spending. with a standard error of 2.2 jobs-an economically and statistically insignificant effect. There are statistically significant and positive effects in two industries, but total number of affected jobs remains quite small. These small positive effects can be linked to labor-using factor shifts and relatively inelastic estimated demand. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).

Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million (ill 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ""best practice"" assumptions are invoked.

This critical review examines a variety of econometric issues, the role of unionization in risk premiums, and the effects of age on the value of a statistical life. Our meta-analysis indicates an income elasticity of the value of a statistical life from about 0.5 to 0.6.

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95).Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.

Although it is widely hypothesized that incroased Hg load to aquatic ecosystems leads to increases in MeHg in fish, there is limited quantitative data to test this hypothesis. Here we examine the available evidence from a range of sources: studies of ecosystems contaminated by industrial discharges, observations of fish MeHg responses to changes in atmospheric load, studies over space and environmental gradients, and experimental manipulations. A summary of the current understanding of the main processes involved in the transport and transformation from Hg load to MeHg in fish is provided. The role of Hg loading is discussed in context with other factors affecting Hg cycling and bioaccumulation in relation to timing and magnitude of response in fish MoHg. The main conclusion drawn is that changes in Hg loading (increase or decrease) will yield a response in fish MeHg but that the timing and magnitude of the response will vary depending of ecosystem-specific variables and the form of the Hg loaded.

Consumption of contaminated fish is the primary route of methylmercury exposure in humans and is detrimental to health. Newly mandated reductions in anthropogenic mercury emissions aim to reduce atmospheric mercury deposition and thus mercury concentrations in fish. However, factors other than mercury deposition are important for mercury bioaccumulation in fish. In the lakes of Isle Royale, U.S.A., reduced rates of sulfate deposition since the Clean Air Act of 1970 have caused mercury concentrations in fish to decline to levels that are safe for human consumption, even without a discernible decrease in mercury deposition. Therefore, reductions in anthropogenic sulfur emissions may provide a synergistic solution to the mercury problem in sulfate-limited freshwaters.

The preferred statistical model for plant-level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972-87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution-intensive industries.

We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.

Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.  Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.  Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.  Results - Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.

Blood lead levels have decreased markedly since the late 1970s. In NHANES III, conducted during 1988-1994, few adults had levels > 20 mu g/dL.  OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study was to determine the risk of mortality in relation to lower blood lead levels observed for adult participants of NHANES III.  METHODS: We analyzed mortality information for 9,757 participants who had a blood lead measurement and who were > 40 years of age at the baseline examination. Using blood lead levels categorized as < 5, 5 to < 10, and >= 10 mu g/dL, we determined the relative risk of mortality from all causes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease through Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.  RESULTS: Using blood lead levels < 5 mu g/dL as the referent, we determined that the relative risk of mortality from all causes was 1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.48] for those with blood levels of 5-9 mu g/dL and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.28-1.98) for those with blood levels >= 10 mu g/dL (p for trend < 0.001). The magnitude of risk was similar for deaths due to cardiovascular disease and cancer, and tests for trend were statistically significant (p < 0.01) for both causes of death.

We examined data collected from 1,333 children who participated in seven international population-based longitudinal cohort studies, followed from birth or infancy until 5-10 years of age.

In this paper we consider associations between lifetime lead exposure, estimated by the area under the blood lead (BPb) versus rime curve (AUG:), and intelligence, with particular concern for identifying lead's behavioral signature. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Version III (WISC-III) was administered to 309 7-year-old children, 261 of whom had complete data on intelligence, blood lead, and relevant sociodemographic covariates [i.e., Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment (HOME), birth weight, gender, sibship size, and maternal age, ethnicity, intelligence, and education]. These showed anticipated associations with 7-year intelligence, explaining 41-47% of the variance in Full Scale, Performance, and Verbal IQ. Before covariate adjustment, AUC7 was unrelated to intelligence; after adjustment, AUC7 explained a significant 2.8%-4.2% of the variance in IQ. After adjustment, a change in lifetime BPb from 10 to 30 mu g/dl related to an estimated decrease of 4.3 Full Scale IQ points; estimated decreases for Verbal and Performance IQ were 3.4 and 4.5 points, respectively. AUG; was significantly and negatively related to three WISC-III factor scores: Freedom from Distractibility, Perceptual Organization, and Verbal Comprehension; the association with Perceptual Organization was the strongest. Consistent with previous studies, the IQ/lead association is small relative to more powerful social factors.

Methods: We measured blood lead concentrations in 172 children at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of age and administered the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale at the ages of 3 and 5 years. The relation between IQ and blood lead concentration was estimated with the use of linear and nonlinear mixed models, with adjustment for maternal IQ, quality of the home environment, and other potential confounders. Results: The blood lead concentration was inversely and significantly associated with IQ. In the linear model, each increase of 10 microg per deciliter in the lifetime average blood lead concentration was associated with a 4.6-point decrease in IQ (P=0.004), whereas for the subsample of 101 children whose maximal lead concentrations remained below 10 microg per deciliter, the change in IQ associated with a given change in lead concentration was greater. When estimated in a nonlinear model with the full sample, IQ declined by 7.4 points as lifetime average blood lead concentrations increased from 1 to 10 microg per deciliter. Conclusions: Blood lead concentrations, even those below 10 microg per deciliter, are inversely associated with children's IQ scores at three and five years of age, and associated declines in IQ are greater at these concentrations than at higher concentrations. These findings suggest that more U.S. children may be adversely affected by environmental lead than previously estimated.

Assessing the strengths of associations within a paper, and for the literature as a whole, are also critical concerns. Modem statistical and epidemiologic methods have considerable advantages for answering these questions. This is illustrated by using non-parametric smoothing to look for the existence of thresholds or non-linearities in the neurotoxic effects of lead, the use of multiple analyses and robust methods to test the stability of the association between dentine lead and children's IQ in the study of Needleman et al., 1979, and the examination of the stability of the association between full scale IQ and blood lead across studies. Non-parametric smoothing shows the dose response relationship between McCarthy score and blood lead reported by Bellinger et al., (1991) has no threshold down to blood lead levels of 1 mug/dl. The association between blood lead and hearing threshold reported by Schwartz and Otto (1991) also has no threshold down to the lowest concentrations seen in that study. The association between dentine lead and IQ in the Needleman et al. (1979) data holds in the full data set with no exclusions and with control for age, is insensitive to exclusions of subjects or inclusions of other covariates, and to the use of robust estimation techniques. Non-parametric smoothing shows the association is supported across the entire range of lead exposure and is not driven by a few outliers. Examination of effect size estimates from the IQ-blood lead studies shows moderately good concordance. This suggests a causal relationship. A meta-analysis of those studies indicates that an increase in blood lead from 10 mug/dl to 20 mug/dl is associated with a reduction of 2.5 points in full scale IQ. The effect was highly significant",Scholarly Journal,2060-AN83,,7,Low-level Lead Exposure and Children’s IQ: A Meta-Analysis and Search for a Threshold,Environmental Research,0013-9351,"Schwartz, J",10.1006/enrs.1994.102,Apr-94,Harvard School of Public Health,,"To assess the strength of the association between blood lead and children's IQ, a metaanalysis of the studies examining the relationship in school age children was performed. Emphasis was given to the size of the effect, since that allows comparisons that are informative about potential confounding and effect modifiers. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. A highly significant association was found between lead exposure and children's IQ (P < 0.001). An increase in blood lead from 10 to 20 mu g/dl was associated with a decrease of 2.6 IQ points in the meta-analysis. This result was robust to inclusion or exclusion of the strongest individual studies and to relaxing the age requirements (school age children) of the meta-analysis. Adding eight studies with effect estimates of 0 would still leave a significant association with blood lead (P < 0.01). There was no evidence that the effect was limited to disadvantaged children and there was a suggestion of the opposite. The studies with mean blood lead levels of 15 mu g/dl or lower in their sample had higher estimated blood lead slopes, suggesting that a threshold at 10 mu g/dl is implausible. The study with the lowest mean blood lead level was examined using nonparametric smoothing. It showed no evidence of a threshold down to blood lead concentrations of 1 mu g/dl. Lead interferes with GABAergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. It has been shown to bind to the NMDA receptor and inhibit long-term potentiation in the hippocampal region of the brain. Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that blood levels of 10 mu g/dl interfere with a broad range of cognitive function in primates.

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.  Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.  Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.   Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95).  Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

Design-A systematic review of 26 epidemiological studies since 1979: prospective studies of birth cohorts, cross sectional studies of blood lead, and cross sectional studies of tooth lead.  Setting-General populations of children greater than or equal to 5 years.  Main outcome measures-For each study, the regression coefficient of IQ on lead, after adjustment for confounders when possible, was used to derive the estimated change in IQ for a specific doubling of either blood or tooth lead.  Results-The five prospective studies with over 1100 children showed no association of cord blood lead or antenatal maternal blood lead with subsequent IQ. Blood lead at around age 2 had a small and significant inverse association with IQ, somewhat greater than that for mean blood lead over the preschool years. The 14 cross sectional studies of blood lead with 3499 children showed a significant inverse association overall, but showed more variation in their results and their ability to allow for confounders. The seven cross sectional studies of tooth lead with 2095 children were more consistent in finding an inverse association, although the estimated:magnitude was somewhat smaller. Overall synthesis of this evidence, including a meta-analysis, indicates that a typical doubling of body lead burden (from 10 to 20 mu g/dl (0.48 to 0.97 mu mol/l) blood lead or from 5 to 10 mu g/g tooth lead) is associated with a mean deficit in full scale IQ of around 1-2 IQ points.  Conclusion-While low level lead exposure may cause a small IQ deficit, other explanations need considering: are the published studies representative; is there inadequate allowance for confounders; are there selection biases in recruiting and following children; and do children of lower IQ adopt behaviour which makes them more prone to lead uptake (reverse causality)? Even if moderate increases in body lead burden adversely affect IQ, a threshold below which there is negligible influence cannot currently be determined. Because of these uncertainties, the degree of public health priority that should be devoted to detecting and reducing moderate increases in children's blood lead, compared with other important social detriments that impede children's development, needs careful consideration.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AN83,,7,Temporal Pattern in the Effect of Post-Natal Blood Lead Level in Intellectual Development of Young Children,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,0892-0362,"Schnaas, L; Rothenberg, S.J.; Perroni, E; et al",10.1016/S0892-0362(00)00101-X,Nov-Dec 2000,"National Institute of Perinatology, Mexico City, Mexico; National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; Charles R.

The regression coefficient of blood lead at 6-18 months became more negative with age until 48 months, when the rate of decline moderated (linear polynomial contrast p = 0.047). The regression coefficient of blood lead at 24-36 months with CGI became more negative as well from 36 to 38 months but then started decreasing toward zero from 48 to 60 months (quadratic polynomial contrast p = 0.019).

Data from a prospective study conducted in Boston suggested that blood lead concentrations at 2 years of age were more predictive of cognitive deficits in older children than were later blood lead concentrations or blood lead concentrations measured concurrently with IQ. Therefore, cross-sectional associations between blood lead and IQ in school-age children have been widely interpreted as the residual effects of higher blood lead concentrations at an earlier age or the tendency of less intelligent children to ingest more leaded dust or paint chips, rather than as a causal relationship in older children. Here we analyze data from a clinical trial in which children were treated for elevated blood lead concentrations (20-44 &mu; g/dL) at about 2 years of age and followed until 7 years of age with serial IQ tests and measurements of blood lead. We found that cross-sectional associations increased in strength as the children became older, whereas the relation between baseline blood lead and IQ attenuated. Peak blood lead level thus does not fully account for the observed association in older children between their lower blood lead concentrations and IQ.

Since 1989, the community has been monitoring blood lead levels in children, studying exposure pathways and conducting comprehensive education and case management programs. From 1989 through 1996, mean blood lead levels of preschool children declined at an average rate of 0.6 mug/dl per year. From 1996 to 1999, mean blood lead levels fell at an average rate of 1.8 mug/dl per year, from 11.5 in 1996 to 5.9 in 1999. The recent rapid decline appears to be mainly attributable to the start-up of a new lead smelter using modern flash-smelting technology in May of 1997. In 1998, the annual arithmetic mean air lead level in Trail was 0.28 mug/m(3), compared with 1.1 mug/m(3) in 1996. Reductions of approximately 50% were observed in lead loadings and concentrations in outdoor dustfall, street dust and indoor dustfall after smelter emissions were reduced. Slight reductions (statistically insignificant) have been observed in carpet dust and soil lead concentrations. During the summer of 2001, the smelting and refining operations at Trail were shut down completely for 3 months. During this period, average air lead levels in Trail dropped to 0.03 mug/m(3). The average blood lead level in Trail pre-school children at the end of the shutdown was 4.7 mug/dl. These results challenge prevailing theories about the relative importance of various environmental lead sources. For example, the US EPA Integrated Biokinetic Uptake Model for Lead(IEUBK), with its emphasis on soil concentrations, would not have predicted the dramatic decline in children's blood lead levels seen in Trail following the reductions in air lead levels. The Trail experience suggests that increased attention should be paid to the importance of active sources of highly bioavailable and mobile lead bearing dusts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, the authors present a framework for distinguishing estimates of attributable cases based on time-series studies from those based on cohort studies, the latter being 5-10 times larger. The authors distinguish four categories of death associated with air pollution: A) air pollution increases both the risk of underlying diseases leading to frailty and the short term risk of death among the frail; B) air pollution increases the risk of chronic diseases leading to frailty but is unrelated to timing of death; C) air pollution is unrelated to risk of chronic diseases but short term exposure increases mortality among persons who are frail; and D) neither underlying chronic disease nor the event of death is related to air pollution exposure. Time-series approaches capture deaths from categories A and C, whereas cohort studies assess cases from categories A, B, and C. In addition, years of life lost can only be derived from cohort studies, where time to death is the outcome, while in time-series studies, death is a once-only event (no dimension in time).

Further statistical analyses suggested that averaged lifetime blood lead concentrations in excess of 20 mug/dL were associated with deficits in PIQ on the order of approximately 7 points when compared to children with mean concentrations less or equal to 10 mug/dL. These results are discussed in terms of their consistency with other similar studies as well as their internal consistency with earlier reports on this cohort. The findings of this investigation support recent initiatives in the United States to reduce the exposure of children to environmental lead.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AN83,,7,The Long-Term Effects of Exposure to Low Doses of Lead in Children - Reply,The New England Journal of Medicine,0028-4793,"Needleman, H.L.",,7-Feb-91,University of Pittsburgh; Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Research Career Development Award,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AN99,,4,ASHTA to Build Chlorine-KOH Plant in Arkansas,Chemical Week,0009-272X,"Sim, PH",,19-Jan-05,,,,Article,No DOI2060-AN99,,4,Bill Would End Mercury Use at Chlorine Plants,http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/031308/met_190792.shtml ,,R.

Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.

In this study, we modeled the monetized damages associated with 407 coal-fired power plants in the United States, focusing on premature mortality from fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). We applied a reduced-form chemistry-transport model accounting for primary PM(2.5) emissions and the influence of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emissions on secondary particulate formation. Outputs were linked with a concentration-response function for PM(2.5)-related mortality that incorporated nonlinearities and model uncertainty. We valued mortality with a value of statistical life approach, characterizing and propagating uncertainties in all model elements. At the median of the plant-specific uncertainty distributions, damages across plants ranged from $30,000 to $500,000 per ton of PM(2.5), $6,000 to $50,000 per ton of SO(2), $500 to $15,000 per ton of NOx, and $0.02 to $1.57 per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Variability in damages per ton of emissions was almost entirely explained by population exposure per unit emissions (intake fraction), which itself was related to atmospheric conditions and the population size at various distances from the power plant. Variability in damages per kilowatt-hour was highly correlated with SO(2) emissions, related to fuel and control technology characteristics, but was also correlated with atmospheric conditions and population size at various distances. Our findings emphasize that control strategies that consider variability in damages across facilities would yield more efficient outcomes.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AN99,,4,Reduction in Fine Particulate Air Pollution and Mortality,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Laden, F; Schwartz, J; Speizer, FE; Dockery, DW",10.1164/rccm.200503-443OC,15-Mar-06,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"Rationale: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear. Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations. Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors. Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95). Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AN99,,4,PPG to Convert Chlorine Cells,Chemical and Engineering News,0009-2347,"McCoy, M.",,8-Aug-05,N/A,N/A,,Scholarly Journal,Found on Web of science but no DOI to record2060-AN99,,4,"Intake of Mercury from Fish lipid Peroxidation and the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary, cardiovascular and any death in Eastern Finnish men","Circulation, 91(3):645-655",0009-7322,"Salonen, J.T.; Nyyssonen Sappanen, K.; et al.",,1995,"University of Kuopio, Finland; National Public Health Institute of Finland, Helsinki, Finland; University of Graz, Austria",Academy of Finland; Ministry of Education of Finland," Background Even though previous studies have suggested an association between high fish intake and reduced coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, men in Eastern Finland, who have a high fish intake, have an exceptionally high CHD mortality. We hypothesized that this paradox could be in part explained by high mercury content in fish. Methods and Results We studied the relation of the dietary intake of fish and mercury, as well as hair content and urinary excretion of mercury, to the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and any cause in 1833 men aged 42 to 60 years who were free of clinical CHD, stroke, claudication, and cancer. Of these, 73 experienced an AMI in 2 to 7 years. Of the 78 deceased men, 18 died of CHD and 24 died of CVD. Men who had consumed local nonfatty fish species had elevated hair mercury contents. In Cox models with the major cardiovascular risk factors as covariates, dietary intakes of fish and mercury were associated with significantly increased risk of AMI and death from CHD, CVD, and any death. Men in the highest tertile (greater than or equal to 2.0 mu g/g) of hair mercury content had a 2.0-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.1; P=.005) age- and CHD-adjusted risk of AMI and a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 6.6; P=.014) adjusted risk of cardiovascular death compared with those with a lower hair mercury content. In a nested case-control subsample, the 24-hour urinary mercury excretion had a significant (P=.042) independent association with the risk of AMI. Both the hair and urinary mercury associated significantly with titers of immune complexes containing oxidized LDL. Conclusions These data suggest that a high intake of mercury from nonfatty freshwater fish and the consequent accumulation of mercury in the body are associated with an excess risk of AMI as well as death from CHD, CVD, and any cause in Eastern Finnish men and this increased risk may be due to the promotion of lipid peroxidation by mercury.",Scholarly Journal,No DOI2060-AN99,,4,"The Influence of Location, Source, and Emission Type in Estimates of the Human Health Benefits of Reducing a ton of Air Pollution",Air Qual Atmos Health 2:169-176,1873-9318,"Fann, N.; Fulcher, C.M.; Hubbell, B.J.",10.1007/s11869-009-0044-0,9-Sep,US Environmental Protection Agency,,"The benefit per ton ($/ton) of reducing PM2.5 varies by the location of the emission reduction, the type of source emitting the precursor, and the specific precursor controlled.

We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas.

Although considerable attention has focused on issues of potential confounding in these associations, little has been done to address the question of what the shape of the dose-response relation looks Like. The question of whether a threshold exists for these relations is of particular concern, with regard to both this application and many other epidemiologic questions. Nonparametric smoothing is widely used to control for the potentially nonlinear relations between covariates and dairy deaths but has been little used to model the air pollution associations. Because sampling variability, among other factors, can introduce considerable noise into the estimates of linear dose-response curves, quantitative summaries have been widely used to come. up with best linear fits. The same ability of mete-analytic techniques to average out noise applies to nonparametric smooth estimates in individual cities. We have developed a method of applying these techniques to combining nonparametric smooths. Using simulation studies, we show that this method can detect threshold and other nonlinear relations in epidemiologic studies, and we then apply it to analyze the association between PM10, and daily deaths in ten U.S. cities. We find that the association appears linear down to the lowest revels observed in the study. This method is generally applicable in settings where data from multiple studies can be combined.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO15,,6,Reduction in Fine Particulate Air Pollution and Mortality,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Laden, F.; Schwartz, J.; Speizer, F.E.; Dockery, D.W.",10.1164/rccm.200503-443OC   ,2006,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990.

In the current study, we focused on the difference in lag time between exposure to total suspended particulates or extreme weather and cause-specific mortality in an effort to understand the potential underlying mechanism. We used a robust Poisson regression in a generalized additive model to investigate the association between air pollution and daily mortality. We used a loess smooth function to model season, weather, and humidity; indicator variables for hot days were also used. To examine the relationship in a currently meaningful range, we excluded all days with a total suspended particulate concentration higher than 200 mu g/m(3). We found a significant association on the concurrent day, both for respiratory infection deaths (11% increase/100 mu g/m(3) increase in total suspended particulate; 95% confidence interval = 5, 17) and for heart-failure deaths (7% increase; 95% confidence interval = 3, 11). The associations with myocardial infarction (i.e., 10% increase; 95% confidence interval = 3, 18) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12% increase, 95% confidence interval = 6, 17) were found for the means of 3 and 4 d prior to death. We observed an effect of cold weather at lag 1 for respiratory infections and an effect of hot weather at lag 0 for heart failure and myocardial infarctions. The association for all causes and cause-specific deaths was almost identical to that noted previously in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Smoothed functions of total suspended particulates suggested a higher slope at lower concentrations, and this finding may account for differences noted between European and U.S. studies. Given that both the dependence between weather and daily mortality and the lag between exposure and death varies by cause of death, analyses by specific causes of death would be very useful in the future.",Scholarly Journal,,Continued by Archives of Environmental & Occupational Health2060-AO15,,6,Price and Seller Concentration in Cement: Effective Oligopoly or Misspecified Transportation Costs,Economics Letters,0165-1765,"Newmark, C",10.1016/S0165-1765(98)00109-8,1998,North Carolina State University,,"A positive correlation between price and seller concentration in cement markets disappears if a different proxy for transportation costs, population density, is included in the specification.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AO15,,6,Optimal Tariffs and Market Power: The Evidence,American Economic Review,0002-8282 ,"Broda, C; Limao, N; Weinstein, D",10.1257/aer.98.5.2032   ,8-Dec,University of Chicago; University of Maryland; Columbia University,National Science Foundation; International Monetary Fund; Center for Japanese Economy and Business,"We find that prior to World Trade Organization membership, countries set import tar tariffs 9 percentage points higher on inelastically supplied imports relative to those supplied elastically.

We exploit this variation, using direct measures of regulation and plant data, to estimate employment effects of sharply increased air quality regulation in Los Angeles. Regulations were accompanied by large reductions in NOx emissions and induced large abatement investments for refineries. Nevertheless, we find no evidence that local air quality regulation substantially reduced employment, even when allowing for induced plant exit and dissuaded plant entry.

Regulatory effort varies by county attainment status and state attitudes. A switch from attainment to nonattainment status induces greater local regulatory effort, leading to air quality improvement, ceteris paribus, and an exit of polluting industries. Polluting industries spread out, moving from nonattainment (polluted) to attainment (initially less polluted) areas. Localities can improve hourly extreme-value reading which trigger regulatory activity, without improving measures of typical conditions (for example, daily medians), by spreading economic activity over the day to dampen daily ozone peaks.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO47,,15,"Environmental Protection, the Economy, and Jobs: National and Regional Analyses","Journal of Environmental Management 86(1): 63-79.",0301-4797,"Bezdek, RH; Wendling, RM; Diperna, P",10. 1016/j.jenvman.2006.11.028,2008,"Management Information Services, Inc.; Jobs and the Environment Initiative",Rockefeller Foundation; Merck Fund; Beldon Fund,"The relationship between environmental protection (EP), the economy, and jobs has been an issue of harsh contention for decades. Does EP harm the economy and destroy jobs or facilitate economic growth and create jobs? We address this issue by summarizing the results of the Jobs and the Environment Initiative, research funded by nonprofit foundations to quantify the relationship between EP, the economy, and jobs. We estimate the size of the US environmental industry and the numbers of environment-related jobs at the national level and in the states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin. This is the first time that such comprehensive, detailed estimates have been developed. Our major finding is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, EP, economic growth, and jobs creation are complementary and compatible: Investments in EP create jobs and displace jobs, but the net effect on employment is positive. Second, environment protection has grown rapidly to become a major sales-generating, job-creating industry-$300 billion/year and 5 million jobs in 2003. Third, most of the 5 million jobs created are standard jobs for accountants, engineers, computer analysts, clerks, factory workers, etc., and the classic environmental job (environmental engineer, ecologist, etc.) constitutes only a small portion of the jobs created. Most of the persons employed in the jobs created may not even realize that they owe their livelihood to protecting the environment. Fourth, Lit the state level, the relationship between environmental policies and economic/job growth is positive, not negative. States can have strong economics and simultaneously protect the environment. Finally, environmental jobs are concentrated in manufacturing and professional, information, scientific, and technical services, and are thus disproportionately the types of jobs all states seek to attract.

There are statistically significant and positive effects in two industries, but total number of affected jobs remains quite small. These small positive effects can be linked to labor-using factor shifts and relatively inelastic estimated demand.

The preferred statistical model for plant-level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972-87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution-intensive industries.

Fall tourists, compared to their summer counterparts, were found to be older, less likely to travel with children, and less active in recreation. Fall color viewing rarely motivated trips and was much more prevalent as an ancillary activity. Distinct types of fall tourists were identified based on patterns of participation in trip activities and whether trips began during the early, middle, or late fall. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine relations between several air pollutants and asthma exacerbation in African Americans, we recruited a panel of 138 children in central Los Angeles. We recorded daily data on respiratory symptoms and medication use for 13 weeks and examined these data in conjunction with data on ozone (O-3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), meteorological variables, pollens, and molds.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the type and amount of resources consumed for an asthma event requiring ED visit and/or hospitalization. Between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1997, occurrences of asthma as a primary diagnosis were identified at 27 hospitals' emergency departments within Premier's Perspective Comparative Database. Patients visiting the ED could either be treated and released or admitted to the hospital. A total of 3,223 patients (age greater than or equal to 18 yr) were identified, with 1,074 (33.3%) requiring hospitalization. For the 2,149 patients who visited the ED only, the average visit cost was $234.48. For hospitalized patients, the average length of stay was 3.8 d, and the cost was $3,102.53. Nursing care was the source of the majority of hospital costs for asthma (43.6%), respiratory therapy (13.6%), and medications (10.4%). For adult asthma patients requiring hospitalization, the total cost is high and resources consumed are unavoidable.

This index was designed to be linear with respect to perceived visual changes over its entire range in a way that is analogous to the decibel scale for sound. Neither visual range nor extinction coefficient have this useful property, which has resulted in their misuse for some applications. By assuming the availability of sensitive scenic targets at every distance, it can be demonstrated that any specific fractional change in extinction coefficient (or visual range) is equally perceptible regardless of baseline visibility conditions. The new index is defined so that its scale, which is expressed in deciview (dnu), is linear with respect to fractional changes in extinction coefficient, b(ext), as 10 ln(b(ext)/0.01 km-1), where extinction coefficient is expressed in km-1. A 1 dnu change is about a 10% change in extinction coefficient, which is a small but perceptible scenic change under many circumstances. Since the deciview scale is near zero for a pristine atmosphere (dnu = 0 for Rayleigh conditions at about 1.8 km elevation) and increases as visibility is degraded, it measures perceived haziness.

These studies often considered other gaseous co-pollutants also as potential confounders, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). However, because each of these air pollutants can have different seasonal patterns and chemical interactions, the estimation and interpretation of each pollutant's individual risk estimates may not be straightforward. Multi-collinearity among the air pollution and weather variables also leaves the possibility of confounding and over- or under-fitting of meteorological variables, thereby potentially influencing the health effect estimates for the various pollutants in differing ways. To investigate these issues, we examined the temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables in the context of air pollution health effects models. We compiled daily data for PM less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure for New York City for the years 1999-2002. We conducted several sets of analyses to characterize air pollution and weather data interactions, to assess different aspects of these data issues: (1) spatial/temporal variation of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants measured at multiple monitors; (2) temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables; and (3) extent and nature of multi-collinearity of air pollution and weather variables in the context of health effects models. The air pollution variables showed a varying extent of intercorrelations with each other and with weather variables, and these correlations also varied across seasons. For example, NO2 exhibited the strongest negative correlation with wind speed among the pollutants considered, while ozone's correlation with PM2.5 changed signs across the seasons (positive in summer and negative in winter). The extent of multi-collinearity problems also varied across pollutants and choice of health effects models commonly used in the literature. These results indicate that the health effects regression need to be run by season for some pollutants to provide the most meaningful results. We also find that model choice and interpretation needs to take into consideration the varying pollutant concurvities with the model co-variables in each pollutant's health effects model specification. Finally, we provide an example for analysis of associations between these air pollutants and asthma emergency department visits in New York City, which evaluate the relationship between the various pollutants' risk estimates and their respective concurvities, and discuss the limitations that these results imply about the interpretability of multi-pollutant health effects models.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AO48,,11,Soil chemistry and nutrition of North American spruce-fir stands: evidence for recent change,Journal of Environmental Quality,0047-2425,"Joslin, J.D.; Kelly, J.M.; van Miegroet, H",,1992,Oak Ridge National Laboratory,US Environmental Protection Agency; US Department of Energy,"One set of hypotheses offered to explain the decline of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) in eastern North America focuses on the effect of acidic deposition on soil chemistry changes that may affect nutrient availability and root function. Long-term soils data suggest that soil acidification has occurred in some spruce stands over the past 50 yr, with plant uptake and cation leaching both contributing to the loss of cations. Studies of tree ring chemistry also have indicated changes in Ca/Al and Mg/Al ratios in red spruce wood, suggesting increases in the ionic strength of soil solution. Irrigation studies using strong acid inputs have demonstrated accelerated displacement of base cations from upper horizons. Spruce-fir (Abies spp.) nutrient budgets indicate that current net Ca and Mg leaching loss rates are of the same order of magnitude as losses to whole tree harvest removals, spread out over a 50-yr rotation. For most cations, red spruce foliar nutrient levels decline with elevation, but it is difficult to assess the contribution of the elevational gradient in atmospheric deposition to this pattern. Compared to northeastern sites, spruce-fir soil solutions in the southern Appalachians have higher nitrate levels and higher Al concentrations, which at times approach the Al toxicity threshold for red spruce seedlings and frequently are at levels known to interfere with cation uptake. There is little evidence that either nutrient deficiencies or Al toxicity are primary causes of red spruce decline in the Northeast, though both may play a role in the Southeast. Major factors that could affect soil chemistry in spruce-fir stands in the future are (i) changes in S and N deposition, (ii) climate changes affecting soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient uptake, and (iii) tree mortality and physical disturbances to soils resulting in soil nitrate release.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO48,,11,Air pollution and daily hospital admissions in metropolitan Los Angeles,Environ Health Perspect,0091-6765,"Linn, W.

We performed Poisson regressions for the entire patient population and for subgroups defined by season, region, or personal characteristics, allowing for effects of temporal variation, weather, and autocorrelation. CO showed the most consistently significant (p < 0.05) relationships to cardiovascular admissions. A wintertime 25th-75th percentile increase in CO (1.1-2.2 ppm) predicted an increase of 4% in cardiovascular admissions. NO2, and, to a lesser extent, PM10 tracked CO and showed similar associations with cardiovascular disease, but O-3 was negatively or nonsignificantly associated. No significant demographic differences were found, although increased cardiovascular effects were suggested in diabetics, in whites and blacks (relative to Hispanics and Asians), and in persons older than 65 years of age. Pulnonary disease admissions associated more with NO2 and PM10 than with CO. Pulmonary effects were generally smaller than cardiovascular effects and were more sensitive to the choice of model.

By comparing data from two separated basins of the lake, we then make an initial effort to isolate and quantify the relative importance of de-acidification and reduced Hg deposition on mercury contamination in fish. Statistical modeling indicates that fish Hg in both basins decreased by roughly 30% between 1994 and 2000 (-5%/y) due to decreased atmospheric Hg loading. De-acidification could account for an additional 5% decrease in one basin (-0.8%/y) and a further 30% decrease in the other basin (-5%/y), since the basins de-acidified at very different rates.

The highest daily PM(10) concentration was 117 mu g/m(3) during the study, indicating that these relationships occurred at concentrations below the ambient air quality standard.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO48,,11,USGS goals for the coming decade,Science,0036-8075,"Myers, M.D.; Ayers, M.A.; Baron, J.S.; Beauchemin, P.R.; Gallagher, K.T.; Goldhaber, M.B.; Hutchinson, D.R.; LaBaugh, J.W.; Sayre, R.G.; Schwarzbach, S.E.",10.1126/science.1147228   ,2007,US Geological Survey; Science Strategy Team,,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AO48,,11,Ambient air pollution and asthma exacerbations in children: an eight-city analysis,Am J Epidemiol.,0002-9262,"Schildcrout, J.

Short-term effects of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide, and warm-season ozone were examined in both one-pollutant and two-pollutant models, using lags of up to 2 days. Lags in carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were positively associated with both measures of asthma exacerbation, and the 3-day moving sum of sulfur dioxide levels was marginally related to asthma symptoms. PM10 and ozone were unrelated to exacerbations. The strongest effects tended to be seen with 2-day lags, where a 1-parts-per-million change in carbon monoxide and a 20-parts-per-billion change in nitrogen dioxide were associated with symptom odds ratios of 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.15) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.15), respectively, and with rate ratios for rescue inhaler use of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), respectively. The authors believe that the observed carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide associations can probably be attributed to mobile-source emissions, though more research is required.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO48,,11,Valuing high altitude spruce-fir forest improvements: Importance of forest condition and recreation activity,Journal of Forest Economics,1104-6899,"Jenkins, D.H.; Sullivan, J.; Amacher, G.S.",,2002,Virginia Tech University; Tennessee Valley Authority,,,Scholarly Journal,Article not found in Web of Science2060-AO79,,9,Carbon Taxes Versus Carbon Markets: What’s the Best Way to Limit Emissions?,The American,,"Bailey, R",,2007,,,,Article,http://www.american.com/archive/2007/may-0507/tax-or-trade2060-AO79,,9,"Greening Industry: New Roles for Communities, Markets, and Governments",Oxford University Press,,World Bank,,2000,,,,Book,2060-AO79,,9,Promoting ‘Green’ Consumer Behavior with Eco Labels," In New Tools for Environmental Protection: Education, Information and Voluntary Measures",,"Thogerson, J",,2002,,,,Book,"National Academy Press, Dietz and Stern, Editors"2060-AO79,,9,Bulletin: Using Design for the Environment Concepts in Your EMS,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),,,,2007,,,,Government Report,http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/iems/bulletins/bullet01/index.html.2060-AO79,,9,"How Are the Toxics Release Inventory Data Used?—Government, Business, Academic and Citizen Uses",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),,,,2003,,,,Government Report,http://www.epa.gov/tri/guide_docs/pdf/2003/2003_datausepaper.pdf2060-AO79,,9, Barriers and Opportunities: A Review of Selected Successful Energy Efficiency Programs, Proceedings from 2001 Industrial Energy Technology Conference.

The results indicate that the higher pollution figures (such as air emissions or offsite shipments of toxic waste) were in a firm's TRI reports, the more likely print journalists were to write about the firm';s toxic releases. Investors also found this pollution information of interest, since nearly three quarters of the TRI pollution releases came from publicly held companies. Stockholders in firms reporting TRI pollution figures experienced negative, statistically significant abnormal returns upon the first release of the information. These abnormal returns translated into an average loss of $4.1 million in stock value for TRI firms on the day the pollution figures were first released",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO79,,9,"Risk, Regulation and the Right to Know: Exploring the Impacts of Access to Information on the Governance of Environmental Risk.",Sustainable Development,0968-0802,"Gouldson, A",10.1002/sd.237   ,2004,London School of Economics and Political Science,,"Within the context of broader debates on the potential of more open, inclusive and deliberative approaches to decision-making, this paper examines the influence that enhanced access to environmental information has had on the governance of industry in the UK. After considering the extent to which information on emissions from industrial sites is practicably accessible to stakeholders, it examines the strategies that the different actors have adopted as a response to the provision of enhanced access to environmental information. In so doing, it highlights the pros and cons of greater transparency and more open engagement from the perspective of regulators, industry, community and pressure groups. It then assesses the impacts of access to information, both on the governance networks through which the different actors interact in an attempt to influence the emissions of the chemicals sector and on the environmental outcomes associated with these networks. It concludes that the provision of access to information has been associated with the emergence of new forms of engagement between regulators, industry and stakeholder groups and that this has coincided with (but has not been the main cause of) dramatic improvements in the environmental performance of the associated firms",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO79,,9,Information as Regulation: The Effect of Community Right-to-Know Laws on Toxic Emissions,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,0095-0696,"Konar, S.; Cohen, M.",10.1006/jeem.1996.0955   ,1997,Vanderbilt University,Vanderbilt Dean's Fund for Summer Research,"There is growing academic and policy-level interest in the use of information as quasi-regulatory mechanisms, such as toxic release inventory (TRI) and ''green labels.'' Mandatory disclosure requirements have been touted as ''market-based incentives'' that may affect firm behavior. We provide new evidence on the effectiveness of disclosure requirements by examining firm behavior in response to disclosures of TRI emissions. We find that firms with the largest stock price decline on the day this information became public subsequently reduced emissions more than their industry peers. This is consistent with the view that financial markets may provide strong incentives for firms to change their environmental behavior",Scholarly Journal,2060-AO81,,32,ADM Plans Entry Into Sugar-Cane Ethanol in Brazil,The Wall Street Journal,,,,22-Jun-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,ADM Press Release,ADM World,,,,16-Apr-07,,,,Article,http://www.admworld.com/naen/pressroom/newspopup.asp?id=454&name=Joint_Cellulosic_Ethanol_Project2060-AO81,,32,ADM Press Release,ADM World,,,,26-Aug-08,,,,Article,http://www.admworld.com/naen/pressroom/newspopup.asp?id=5172060-AO81,,32,Algae Corrals Carbon Dioxide,EnergyBiz Magazine,,"Bullock, Cary",,7-Mar,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Angostura launches US $11m ethanol plant,The Trinidad Guardian,,,,,,,,Article,http://www.guardian.co.tt/archives/2004-08-06/business1.html2060-AO81,,32,Article on Kinder Morgan investigations re: the shipment of ethanol by pipeline,Kinder Morgan,,,,,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Barbados to build $72 million ethanol dehydration plant,Caribbean Net News,,,,2008,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Brazil priming ethanol initiative to supply fuel-thirsty Japan,The Japan Times,,,,22-Aug-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Brazil says biofuel production not to blame for food crisis,AFP,,,,1-Jun-08,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,BRAZIL: Loophole Hurt U.S. Ethanol Prices,DesMoines Register,,,,18-Oct-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Chevron and NREL to Collaborate on Research to Produce Transportation Fuels using Algae,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,,,31-Oct-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,China to freeze approvals for corn processing projects for 3 years,Forbes,,,,21-Sep-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Entering Tariff-Free,Ethanol Producer Magazine,,,,4-Jan,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Ethanol dehydration facility to be built in Trinidad,Ethanol Producer Magazine,,,,6-Dec,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Ethanol Giants Struggle to Crack Brazil Market,Wall Street Journal ,,,,10-Sep-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Ethanol Tariff Loophole Sparks a Boom in Caribbean Islands Build Plants to Process Brazil's Fuels: Farm Belt Cries Foul,The Wall Street Journal,,,,9-Mar-07,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Ethanol: From Brazil to the World,Petrobras Magazine,,,,,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Fuel Retail facility station count,National Petroleum News,,,,7-Oct,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,"FYI Newsletter Volume 13, Issue 10",NEVC,,,,23-Jul-07,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Genencor Launches First Ever Commercial Enzyme Product for Cellulosic Ethanol,World-Wire,,,,22-Oct-07,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Groundbreaking Initiated for Unique Renewable Fuels Plant in Louisiana,Trading Markets,,,,6-Oct-08,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Investor Vinod Khosla: Advanced biofuels are closer than you think,,,"LaMonica, Martin",,,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,"Jatropha harmful for kids, soil and aquatic life: scientist",India eNews,,"Kumar, Sujeet",,8-May-08,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,MarketFacts 2007,National Petroleum News,,,,7-Oct,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,"NEVC FYI Newsletter: Volume 14, Issue 14",NEVC,,,,25-Aug-08,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Pipeline Projects on Hold,EPM,,,,8-Jul,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Purdue yeast makes ethanol from agricultural waste more effectively,Purdue News,,,,28-Jun-04,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Rees scraps biofuel mandates,The Australian,,"Roberts, Greg",,8-Sep,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Senate Finance May Take Up Drawback Loophole As Part of Energy Bill,EnergyWashington Week,,"Rhode, Peter",,18-Apr-07,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Special Report: Fleet Management,Federal Times,,,,23-Jun-08,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Sugar Gains Caped by Brazilian Ethanol Expansion,Bloomberg,,,,19-Jun-08,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,"Sugarcane Industry in Brazil: Ethanol, Sugar, Bioelectricity",UNICA-Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association,,,,,,,,Article2060-AO81,,32,Tax Loophole Helps US Import Ethanol 'Duty Free',INO,,,,2008,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,The Great Biomass Inquisition,Ethanol Producer Magazine,,"Kotrba, Ron",,7-Jan,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Thermochemical Versus Biochemical,Biomass Magazine,,,,7-Jun,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Tyson ConocoPhillips Venture in Jeopardy,The Morning News,,,,26-Sep-08,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,Tyson's Fats to Fuel Plant on Schedule,The Morning News,,,,6-Oct-08,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,US $36m ethanol plant for Barbados,Jamaica Gleaner News,,,,8-Aug,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,View From the Hill,Ethanol Producer Magazine,,,,7-Jul,,,,Article,2060-AO81,,32,World Energy: Global New Summary,,,,,13-Jun-08,,,,Article,http://www.worldenergy.net2060-AO81,,32,A Blueprint for Green Energy in the Americas: Strategic Analysis of Opportunities for Brazil and the Hemisphere,,,,,2006,,,,Book,2060-AO81,,32,A reassessment of the economic effects of ozone on U.S. agriculture,JAPCA,,"Adams, RM;

The consequential approach uses marginal data and avoids co-product allocation by system expansion. The attributional approach uses average or supplier-specific data and treats co-product allocation by applying allocation factors. Agricultural LCAs typically regard local production as affected and they only include the interventions related to the harvested area. However, as changes in demand and production may affect foreign production, yields and the displacement of other crops in regions where the agricultural area is constrained, there is a need for incorporating the actual affected processes in agricultural consequential LCA. This paper presents a framework for defining system boundaries in consequential agricultural LCA. The framework is applied to an illustrative case study; LCA of increased demand for wheat in Denmark. The aim of the LCA screening is to facilitate the application of the proposed methodology. A secondary aim of the LCA screening is to illustrate that there are different ways to meet increased demand for agricultural products and that the environmental impact from these different ways vary significantly.  Materials and methods The proposed framework mainly builds on the work of Ekvall T, Weidema BP (Int J Life Cycle Assess 9(3):pp. 161-171, 2004), agricultural statistics (FAOSTAT, FAOSTAT Agriculture Data, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (2006), http://apps.fao.org/ (accessed June)), and agricultural outlook (FAPRI, US and world agricultural outlook, Food and Agriculture Research Institute, Iowa, 2006a). The framework and accompanying guidelines concern the suppliers affected, the achievement of increased production (area or yield), and the substitutions between crops. The framework, which is presented as a decision tree, proposes four possible systems that may be affected as a result of the increased demand of a certain crop in a certain area.  Results The core of the proposed methodology is a decision tree, which guides the identification of affected processes in consequential agricultural LCA. The application of the methodology is illustrated with a case study presenting an LCA screening of wheat in Denmark. Different scenarios of how increased demand for wheat can be met show significant differences in emission levels as well as land use.  Discussion The great differences in potential environmental impacts of the analysed results underpin the importance of system delimitation. The consequential approach is appointed as providing a more complete and accurate but also less precise result, while the attributional approach provides a more precise result but with inherent blind spots, i.e. a less accurate result.  Conclusions The main features of the proposed framework and case study are: (1) an identification of significant sensitivity on results of system delimitation, and (2) a formalised way of identifying blind spots in attributional agricultural LCAs.  Recommendations and perspectives It is recommended to include considerations on the basis of the framework presented in agricultural LCAs if relevant. This may be done either by full quantification or as qualitative identification of the most likely ways the agricultural product system will respond on changed demand. Hereby, it will be possible to make reservations to the conclusions drawn on the basis of an attributional LCA.

Benzene and toluene conversion in leaves occurs with the aromatic ring cleavage and their carbon atoms are mainly incorporated into nonvolatile organic acids, while their incorporation into amino acids is less intensive. Intact spinach chloroplasts oxidize benzene, and this process is strongly stimulated in light. Oxidation of benzene by spinach chloroplasts or by enzyme preparation from spinach leaves is almost completely inhibited by 8-oxyquinoline or sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, and slightly affected by alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. Benzene oxidation by enzyme preparation is significantly stimulated by NADH and NADPH; in their presence, the benzene hydroxylation product, phenol, is formed in a determinable amount.

One such program mandates the use of oxygenates in the wintertime to reduce CO emissions in cities such as Albuquerque, NM. A field study was conducted in Albuquerque to determine the atmospheric impacts of the use of ethanol fuels. Atmospheric concentrations of ozone, oxides of nitrogen, CO, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), aldehydes, and organic acids were measured in the summer of 1993, before the use of ethanol fuels, and in the winters of 1994 and 1995, during the use of 10% ethanol fuel (>99%). Data showed increased levels of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and aldehydes in winter. The formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio was 1.4, indicating an anthropogenic source, and PAN and acetaldehyde levels were anti-correlated over short time periods, indicating primary acetaldehyde emissions. A comparison of data taken at rural sites south of the city indicates that although there is a significant anthropogenic component to the aldehyde concentrations during the winter, there are also contributions from the photochemical oxidation of natural hydrocarbons.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,A Blueprint for Green Energy in the Americas,Foreign Affairs,0015-7120,"Rothkopf, Garten",,7-Sep,ARTICLE NOT AVAILABLE,ARTICLE NOT AVAILABLE,,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,The Effect of Biodiesel Feedstock on Regulated Emissions in Chassis Dynamometer Tests of a Pickup Truck,Transactions of the ASAE,0001-2351,"Peterson, CL; Taberski, JS; Thompson, JC; Chase, CL",,Nov-00,ASAE Fellow Engineer; University of Idaho; Biomass Energy Systems,"US Department of Energy; Idaho Department of Water Resources; US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service","Six different vegetable oil esters (coconut ethyl ester used hydrogenated soy methyl ester, rapeseed ethyl ester, mustard ethyl ester, safflower ethyl ester, and a commercial methyl ester of soy oil) were selected to represent a range of iodine numbers from 7.88 to 133. These vegetable oil esters were tested neat and in 20% biodiesel/80% diesel blends in comparison with low sulfur diesel fuel or the effect on regulated emissions. The test vehicle was a pickup truck with a 5.9 L turbo-charged and inter-cooled direct injection diesel engine. The emissions rests were conducted at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority Emissions Testing Facility on a chassis dynamometer. It was found that lower iodine numbers correlated with reduced nitrogen oxides (NOx). As iodine number increased from 7.88 to 129.5 the NOx increased 29.3%. Fatty acids with two double bonds appeared to have more effect on increasing NOx emissions than did fatty acids with one double bond. Changes in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and particulate matter (PM) were not linearly correlated with iodine number It is apparent that the type of feedstock oil affects the characteristics of the biodiesel fuel. The most obvious difference is that the pour point changes with fatty acid composition, however other fuel characteristics, some of which effect combustion, are also changed.

Chassis dynamometer tests were performed on four light heavy-duty diesel trucks using each of the four fuels. The results of this study showed that biodiesel, the biodiesel blends, and the synthetic diesel produced generally lower THC and CO emissions than California diesel.

In this study, we used the elemental composition of size-fractionated particles to identify several distinct source-related fractions of fine particles and examined the association of these fractions with daily mortality in each of the six cities. Using specific rotation factor analysis for each city, we identified a silicon factor classified as soil and crustal material, a lead factor classified as motor vehicle exhaust, a selenium factor representing coal combustion, and up to two additional factors. We extracted daily counts of deaths from National Center for Health Statistics records and estimated city-specific associations of mortality with each source factor by Poisson regression, adjusting for time trends, weather, and the other source factors. Combined effect estimates were calculated as the inverse variance weighted mean of the city-specific estimates. In the combined analysis, a 10 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 from mobile sources accounted for a 3.4% increase in daily mortality [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-5.2%], and the equivalent increase in fine particles from coal combustion sources accounted for a 1.1% increase [CI, 0.3-2.0%).

Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.  Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.  Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.  Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.

These results are robust with respect to increases in partitioning of non-isoprene oxidation products at higher altitudes and increased wet removal of isoprene oxidation products.

The method developed is illustrated by application to the air quality situation in Southern California. The contributions of more than 50 types of air pollution sources to primary particle concentrations at Claremont, CA, are separated from each other by post-processing the output from the aerosol processes trajectory model for an externally mixed aerosol developed previously by Kleeman and Cass (1998, Atmospheric Environment 32, 2803-2816, 1999 Environmental Science and Technology, 33, 177-189).",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Organic aerosol formation from the oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons,Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres,2169-897X,"Griffin, RJ; Cocker, DR; Flagan, RC; Seinfeld, JH",10.1029/1998JD100049,20-Feb-99,California Institute of Technology,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Science Foundation; Coordinating Research Council; Chevron Corporation,"A series of outdoor chamber experiments has been used to establish and characterize the significant atmospheric aerosol-forming potentials of the most prevalent biogenic hydrocarbons emitted by vegetation. These compounds were also studied to elucidate the effect of structure on aerosol yield for these types of compounds. Because oxidation products partition between the gas and aerosol phases, the aerosol yields of the parent biogenic hydrocarbons depend on the concentration of organic aerosol into which these products, can be absorbed. For organic mass concentrations between 5 and 40 mu g m(-3), mass-based yields in photooxidation experiments range from 17 to 67% for sesquiterpenes, from 2 to 23% for cyclic diolefins, from 2 to 15% for bicyclic olefins, and from 2 to 6% for the acyclic triolefin ocimene. In these photooxidation experiments, hydroxyl and nitrate radicals and ozone can contribute to consumption of the parent hydrocarbon. For bicyclic olefins (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, Delta(3)-carene, and sabinene), experiments were also carried out at daytime temperatures in a dark system in the presence of ozone or nitrate radicals alone. For ozonolysis experiments, resulting aerosol yields are less dependent on organic mass concentration, when compared to full, sunlight-driven photooxidation. Nitrate radical experiments exhibit extremely high conversion to aerosol for beta-pinene, sabinene, and Delta(3)-carene.

A maximum secondary organic aerosol concentration of 6.8-mu-g m-3 is predicted for Claremont, CA, during this episode. On a daily average basis at Claremont about 46% of this secondary organic aerosol is predicted to be a result of the oxidation of non-toluene aromatics (xylenes, alkylbenzenes, etc.), 19% from toluene, 16% from biogenic hydrocarbons (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, etc.), 15% from alkanes and 4% from alkenes. The major uncertainties in predicting secondary organic aerosol concentrations are the reactive organic gas emissions, the aerosol yields and the partitioning of the condensable gases between the two phases.

Experiments are performed under two limiting NOx conditions; under high-NOx conditions the peroxy radicals (RO2) react only with NO, while under low-NOx conditions they react only with HO2. For all three aromatics studied (m-xylene, toluene, and benzene), the SOA yields (defined as the ratio of the mass of organic aerosol formed to the mass of parent hydrocarbon reacted) under low-NOx conditions substantially exceed those under high-NOx conditions, suggesting the importance of peroxy radical chemistry in SOA formation. Under low-NOx conditions, the SOA yields for m-xylene, toluene, and benzene are constant (36%, 30%, and 37%, respectively), indicating that the SOA formed is effectively nonvolatile under the range of M-o(>10 mu g m(-3) studied. Under high-NOx conditions, aerosol growth occurs essentially immediately, even when NO concentration is high. The SOA yield curves exhibit behavior similar to that observed by Odum et al.

The yields measured under high-NOx conditions are higher than previous measurements, suggesting a 'rate effect' in SOA formation, in which SOA yields are higher when the oxidation rate is faster.

Anthropogenic primary particle sources contribute less than 10% of the fine particle mass concentration at the background site.

The human health implications of this effect are of significant interest since human exposure to environmental formaldehyde is widespread, though at lower concentrations than those that cause cancer in rats. In this article, which is part of a larger effort to predict the human cancer risks of inhaled formaldehyde, we describe biologically motivated quantitative modeling of the exposure-tumor response continuum in the rat. An anatomically realistic, three-dimensional fluid dynamics model of the F344 rat nasal airways was used to predict site-specific flux of formaldehyde from inhaled air into tissue, since both SCC and preneoplastic lesions develop in a characteristic site-specific pattern. Flux into tissue was used as a dose metric for two modes of action, direct mutagenicity and cytolethality-regenerative cellular proliferation (CRCP), which in turn were linked to key parameters of a two-stage clonal growth model. The direct mutagenicity mode of action was represented by a low dose linear dose-response model of DNA-protein cross-link (DPX) formation. An empirical J-shaped dose-response model and a threshold model fit to the empirical data were used for CRCP. In the clonal growth model, the probability of mutation per cell generation was a function of the tissue concentration of DPX while the rate of cell division was calculated from the CRCP data. Maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate parameter values. Survivor (a nontumor outcome) and tumor data for controls from the National Toxicology Program database and from two formaldehyde inhalation bioassays were used for likelihood calculations. The J-shaped dose-response for CRCP provided a better description of the SCC data than did the threshold model. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the rodent tumor response is due to the CRCP mode of action, with the directly mutagenic pathway having little, if any, influence. When evaluated in light of modeling and database uncertainties, particularly the specification of the clonal growth model and the dose-response data for CRCP, this work provides suggestive though not definitive evidence for a J-shaped dose-response for formaldehyde-mediated nasal SCC in the F344 rat.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,"Human respiratory tract cancer risks of inhaled formaldehyde: Dose-response predictions derived from biologically motivatedcomputational modeling of a combined rodent and human dataset",Toxicological Sciences,1096-6080,"Conolly, RB; Kimbell, JS; Janszen, D; Schlosser, PM; Kalisak, D; Preston, J; Miller, FJ",10.1093/toxsci/kfh223,4-Nov,CIIT Centers for Health Research,,"Formaldehyde inhalation at 6 ppm and above causes nasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in F344 rats. The quantitative implications of the rat tumors for human cancer risk are of interest, since epidemiological studies have provided only equivocal evidence that formaldehyde is a human carcinogen. Conolly et al. (Toxicol. Sci. 75, 432-447, 2003) analyzed the rat tumor dose-response assuming that both DNA-reactive and cytotoxic effects of formaldehyde contribute to SCC development. The key elements of their approach were: (1) use of a three-dimensional computer reconstruction of the rat nasal passages and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to predict regional dosimetry of formaldehyde; (2) association of the flux of formaldehyde into the nasal mucosa, as predicted by the CFD model, with formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPX) and with cytolethality/regenerative cellular proliferation (CRCP); and (3) use of a two-stage clonal growth model to link DPX and CRCP with tumor formation. With this structure, the prediction of the tumor dose response was extremely sensitive to cell kinetics. The raw dose-response data for CRCP are J-shaped, and use of these data led to a predicted J-shaped dose response for tumors, notwithstanding a concurrent low-dose-linear, directly mutagenic effect of formaldehyde mediated by DPX. In the present work the modeling approach used by Conolly et al. (ibid.) was extended to humans. Regional dosimetry predictions for the entire respiratory tract were obtained by merging a three-dimensional CFD model for the human nose with a one-dimensional typical path model for the lower respiratory tract. In other respects, the human model was structurally identical to the rat model. The predicted human dose response for DPX was obtained by scale-up of a computational model for DPX calibrated against rat and rhesus monkey data. The rat dose response for CRCP was used ""as is"" for the human model, since no preferable alternative was identified. Three sets of baseline parameter values for the human clonal growth model were obtained through separate calibrations against respiratory tract cancer incidence data for nonsmokers, smokers, and a mixed population of nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Additional risks of respiratory tract cancer were predicted to be negative up to about one ppm for all three cases when the raw CRCP data from the rat were used. When a hockey-stick-shaped model was fit to the rat CRCP data and used in place of the raw data, positive maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of additional risk were obtained. These MLE estimates were lower, for some comparisons by as much as 1,000-fold, than MLE estimates from previous cancer dose-response assessments for formaldehyde. Breathing rate variations associated with different physical activity levels did not make large changes in predicted additional risks. In summary, this analysis of the human implications of the rat SCC data indicates that (1) cancer risks associated with inhaled formaldehyde are de minimis (10(-6) or less) at relevant human exposure levels, and (2) protection from the noncancer effects of formaldehyde should be sufficient to protect from its potential carcinogenic effects.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Effect of Several Oxygenates on Regulated Emissions from Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines,Environmental Science and Technology,0013-936X,"McCormick, RL; Ross, JD; Graboski, MS",10.1021/es9606438,Apr-97,Colorado School of Mines,,"Oxygenates produce a significant reduction in emissions of particulate matter (PM-10) from diesel engines but in most cases also cause the nitrogen oxide emissions to increase.

The results of the statistical analysis suggest that the use of E10 results in statistically significant decreases in CO emissions (-16%); statistically significant increases in emissions of NMHC (9%), NMOG (14%), acetaldehyde (108%), 1,3-butadiene (16%), and benzene (15%); and no statistically significant changes in NOX, CO2, CH4, N2O or formaldehyde emissions. The statistical analysis suggests that the use of E85 results in statistically significant decreases in emissions of NOX (-45%), NMHC (-48%), 1,3-butadiene (-77%), and benzene (-76%); statistically significant increases in emissions of formaldehyde (73%) and acetaldehyde (2540%), and no statistically significant change in CO, CO2, and NMOG emissions.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Subchronic toxicity of 4-vinylcyclohexene in rats and mice by inhalation exposure,Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,0272-0590,"Bevan, C; Stadler, JC; Elliott, GS; Frame, SR; Baldwin, JK; Leung, HW; Moran, E; Panepinto, AS",10.1006/faat.1996.0101,Jul-96,"Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc.; Haskell Laboratories; Consulting Services; Union Carbide Corporation; Chemical Manufacturers Association",Butadiene Panel of the Chemical Manufacturers Association,"This study was conducted to evaluate the subchronic toxicity of 4-vinylcyclohexene (VCH). Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F(1) mice were exposed by inhalation to VCH 6 hr/ day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks. Rats were exposed to 0, 250, 1000, or 1500 ppm, and mice were exposed to 0, 50, 250, or 1000 ppm. In addition, another group of rats and mice was exposed to 1000 ppm butadiene so that a comparison could be made between the two compounds. Exposure to 1000 ppm VCH resulted in deaths of all male mice and 5/10 female mice on Test Days 11 or 12. Three additional female mice exposed to 1000 ppm VCH died prior to study completion. The most notable compound-related clinical sign was lethargy observed in the 1500 ppm VCH-exposed rats and 1000 ppm VCH-exposed mice. Male rats exposed to 1500 ppm VCH had significantly lower body weights compared to controls, and male and female rats in the 1500 ppm group had significantly lower body weight gains. None of the VCH-exposed animals or butadiene-exposed rats showed any compound-related hematological effects. However, mice exposed to 1000 ppm butadiene exhibited mild macrocytic anemia. Clinical chemistry evaluation and urinalysis showed no compound-related effects in rats exposed to either VCH or butadiene. Male and female rats exposed to 1000 or 1500 ppm VCH or 1000 ppm butadiene had increased absolute and/or relative liver weights, and male rats in these same exposure groups had increased relative kidney weights. Microscopically, increased accumulation of hyaline droplets was observed in the kidneys of male rats from all VCH exposure groups. Although compound-related, the droplets were not accompanied by cytotoxicity. In mice, the most notable adverse histopathological effect was ovarian atrophy in females exposed to 1000 ppm VCH or 1000 ppm butadiene. The atrophy was slightly more severe in the VCH-exposed females than in the butadiene-exposed females. There were no other compound-related pathological effects in male or female mice exposed to VCH. Additionally, butadiene-exposed male mice had decreased testicular weights, accompanied by slight testicular degeneration and atrophy. For VCH exposure, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level is 1000 ppm for rats based on lethargy and lowered body weights and 250 ppm for mice based on mortality and ovarian atrophy.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Source Apportionment of PM2.5 in the Southeastern United States Using Solvent-Extractable Organic Compounds as Tracers,Environmental Science and Technology,0013-936X,"Zheng, M; Cass, GR; Schauer, JJ; Edgerton, ES",10.1021/es011275x,1-Jun-02,"Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Wisconsin-Madison; Atmospheric Research and Analysis, Inc.","Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.","A chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model using particle-phase organic compounds as tracers is applied to apportion the primary source contributions to fine particulate matter and fine particulate organic carbon concentrations in the southeastern United States to determine the seasonal variability of these concentrations.

Recent studies have shown an influence of ventilation on personal/indoor-outdoor relations and stronger associations of adverse effects with combustion-related particles. We evaluated whether differences in prevalence of air conditioning (AC) and/or the contribution of different sources to total PM10 emissions could partly explain the observed variability in exposure-effect relations. We used regression coefficients of the relation between PM10 and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and pneumonia from a recent study in 14 U.S. cities. We obtained data on the prevalence of AC from the 1993 American Housing Survey and data on PM10 emissions by source category, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and population density from the U.S. EPA. We analyzed data using meta-regression techniques. PM10 regression coefficients for CVD and COPD decreased significantly with increasing percentage of homes with central AC when cities were stratified by whether their PM10 concentrations peaked in winter or nonwinter months. PM10 coefficients for CVD increased significantly with increasing percentage of PM10 emission from highway vehicles, highway diesels, oil combustion, metal processing, decreasing percentage of PM10 emission from fugitive dust, and increasing population density and VMT/mile(2). In multivariate analysis, only percentage of PM10 from highway vehicles/diesels and oil combustion remained significant. For COPD and pneumonia, associations were less significant but the patterns of the assocations were similar to that for CVD.

Geographic information system (GIS) approaches have recently been used to improve exposure assessment, particularly for traffic particles, but only for long-term exposure.  OBJECTIVES: We analyzed approximately 100,000 deaths from all, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes for the years 1995-2002 using a case-crossover analysis.  METHODS: Estimates of exposure to traffic particles were geocoded to the address of each decedent on the day before death and control days, with these estimates derived from a GIS-based exposure model incorporating deterministic covariates, such as traffic density and meteorologic factors, and a smooth function of latitude and longitude.  RESULTS: We estimate that an IQR increase in traffic particle exposure on the day before death is associated with a 2.3% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2 to 3.4%] in all-cause mortality risk. Stroke deaths were particularly elevated (4.4%; 95% CI, -0.2 to 9.3%), as were diabetes deaths (5.7%; 95% CI, -1.7 to 13.7%). Sulfate particles are spatially homogeneous, and using a central monitor, we found that an IQR increase in sulfate levels on the day before death is associated with a 1.1% (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.0%) increase in all-cause mortality risk.

Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks.  Methods. In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities.  Results. Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates.  Conclusions. Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,The concentration-response relation between PM2.5 and daily deaths,Environmental Health Perspectives,0091-6765,"Schwartz, J; Laden, F; Zanobetti, A",,2-Oct,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"Particulate air pollution at commonly occurring concentrations is associated with daily deaths. Recent attention has focused on the shape of the concentration-response curve, particularly at low doses. Several recent articles have reported that particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 mum (PM10) was associated with daily deaths with no evidence of a threshold. These reports have used smoothing or spline methods in individual cities and pooled the results across multiple cities to obtain estimates that are more robust. To date, fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mum; PM2.5), a component of PM10, has not been examined in this regard. We examined this association in a hierarchical model in six U.S. cities. In the first stage, we fit log-linear models including smooth functions of PM2.5 in each city, controlling for season, weather, and day of the week. These smooth functions allowed for nonlinearities in the city-specific associations. We combined the estimated curves across cities using a hierarchical model that allows for heterogeneity. We found an essentially linear relationship down to 2 mug/m(3). The same approach was applied to examine the concentration response to traffic particles, controlling for particles from other sources. Once again, the association showed no sign of a threshold. The magnitude of the association suggests that controlling fine particle pollution would result in thousands fewer early deaths per year.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Association of black carbon with cognition among children in a prospective birth cohort study,American Journal of Epidemiology,0002-9262,"Suglia, SF; Gryparis, A; Wright, RO; Schwartz, J; Wright, RJ",10.1093/aje/kwm308,1-Feb-08,"Harvard School of Public Health; University of Crete, Crete, Greece; Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School",US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institutes of Health,"While studies show that ultrafine and fine particles can be translocated from the lungs to the central nervous system, the possible neurodegenerative effect of air pollution remains largely unexplored.

This article reviews current perspectives on how ethanol can produce neuroteratogenic effects by its interactions with molecular regulators of brain development. The current evidence suggests that alcohol produces many of its damaging effects by exerting specific actions on molecules that regulate key developmental processes (e.g., L1 cell adhesion molecule, alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase), interfering with the early development of midline serotonergic neurons and disrupting their regulatory-signaling function for other target brain structures, interfering with trophic factors that regulate neurogenesis and cell survival, or inducing excessive cell death via oxidative stress or activation of caspase-3 proteases. The current understanding of pathogenesis mechanisms suggests several strategic approaches to develop rational molecular prevention. However, the development of behavioral and biologic treatments for alcohol-affected children is crucial because it is unlikely that effective delivery of preventative interventions can realistically be achieved in ways to prevent prenatal damage in at-risk pregnancies. Toward that end, behavioral training that promotes experience-dependent neuroplasticity has been effective in a rat model of cerebellar damage induced by alcohol exposure during the period of brain development that is comparable to that of the human third trimester.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Experimentelle reizwirkungen von Acrolein auf den Menschen,International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health,0340-0131,"Weber-Tschopp, A; Fischer, T; Gierer, R; et al.",,1977,"Institut fur Hygiene und Arbeitsphysiologie, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, Schweiz","Der Association Suisse des Fabricants de Cigarettes, Fribourg (ASFC)",,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Inhalation toxicity of acetaldehyde in rats 1.

The corresponding atmospheric half-lives are one week for methanol and t-butyl alcohol, 2.5 days for ethanol, and 8-15 h for other alcohols. Laboratory studies of alcohol-OH reaction products are described and reaction mechanisms are outlined. Major products are formaldehyde from methanol, acetaldehyde from ethanol, acetone from 2-propanol, 2-butanone and acetaldehyde from 2-butanol and acetone and formaldehyde from t-butyl alcohol. The reaction of OH with alcohols involves H-atom abstraction from C-H bonds; H-atom abstraction from the O-H bond is negligible. The alkyl radicals (R) and alpha-hydroxyalkyl radicals thus formed react with oxygen. This reaction involves addition for alkyl radicals (R + O-2 --> RO2) and H-atom abstraction for alpha-hydroxyalkyl radicals (e.g, ethanol + OH --> CHSCHOH, CH3CHOH + O-2 --> HO2 + CH3HO).

Despite the statistical significance of an average cost-size relationship, average capital cost for plant of a given size at a particular location is still highly variable due to costs associated with unique circumstances, possibly water availability, utility access and environmental compliance.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Aerosolized acetaldehyde induces histamine-mediated bronchoconstriction in asthmatics,American Review of Respiratory Disease,0003-0805,"Myou, S; Fujimura, M; Nishi, K; Ohka, T; Matsuda, T",,Oct-93,"Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan; Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan",,"It has been reported that acetaldehyde may be a main factor of alcohol-induced bronchoconstriction in Japanese patients with asthma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct action of acetaldehyde on the airway in asthmatic and healthy nonasthmatic subjects. We investigated the bronchial response to inhalation of ascending doses (5,10, 20, and 40 mg/ml) of acetaldehyde in nine asthmatic subjects, who were treated with placebo or terfenadine for 4 days in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over fashion, and in nine age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine was also measured in the same asthmatics oh a separate day. Inhaled acetaldehyde caused marked (more than 20%) significant decrease in FEV1 in asthmatics after placebo, which was larger than that in asthmatics after terfenadine and in healthy subjects. There was no significant difference in the decrease in FEV1 between asthmatics treated with terfenadine and healthy subjects. There was a significant correlation between the methacholine and acetaldehyde concentrations producing a 20% fall in FEV1 in asthmatics. We conclude that acetaldehyde causes bronchoconstriction indirectly via histamine release in asthmatics, and that nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a necessary precondition for the expression of acetaldehyde-produced bronchoconstriction.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Effects of Dried Distillers' grain on Fecal Prevalence and Growth of Escherichia Coli 0157 in Batch Culture Fermentations from Cattle,Applied and Environmental Microbiology,0099-2240,"Jacob, ME; Fox, JT; Drouillard, JS; Renter, DG; Nagaraja, TJ",10.1128/AEM.01342-07,8-Jan,Kansas State University,US Department of Agriculture,"Distillers' grains (DG), a by-product of ethanol production, are fed to cattle.

Ten fecal samples were collected from each pen weekly for 12 weeks to isolate E. coli O157. Cattle fed 25% DDG with 5 or 15% silage had a higher (P = 0.01) prevalence of E. coli O157 than cattle fed a diet without DDG. Batch culture ruminal or fecal microbial fermentations were conducted to evaluate the effect of DDG on E. coli O157 growth. The first study utilized microbial inocula from steers fed SFC or dry-rolled corn with 0 or 25% DDG and included their diet as the substrate. Ruminal microbial fermentations from steers fed DDG had higher E. coli O157 contents than ruminal microbial fermentations from steers fed no DDG (P < 0.05) when no substrate was included. Fecal fermentations showed no DDG effect on E. coli O157 growth. In the second study with DDG as a substrate, ruminal fermentations with 0.5 g DDG had higher (P < 0.01) E. coli O157 concentrations at 24 h than ruminal fermentations with 0, 1, or 2 g DDG. In fecal fermentations, 2 g DDG resulted in a higher concentration (P < 0.05) at 24 It than 0, 0.5, or I g DDG.

For both the pre-industrial period and in recent times, after taking into account the large-scale changes in synthetic N fertiliser production, we find an overall conversion factor of 3-5% from newly fixed N to N2O-N. We assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production systems. It is covered only in part by the default conversion factor for ""direct"" emissions from agricultural crop lands (1%) estimated by IPCC (2006), and the default factors for the ""indirect"" emissions (following volatilization/deposition and leaching/runoff of N: 0.35-0.45%) cited therein. However, as we show in the paper, when additional emissions included in the IPCC methodology, e.g. those from livestock production, are included, the total may not be inconsistent with that given by our ""top-down"" method. When the extra N2O emission from biofuel production is calculated in ""CO2-equivalent"" global warming terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of ""saving"" emissions of fossil fuel derived CO2, the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as much or more to global warming by N2O emissions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate impacts. This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass to biofuel. It does not take into account the use of fossil fuel on the farms and for fertilizer and pesticide production, but it also neglects the production of useful co-products.

In 2002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) entered into enforcement actions with 12 fuel ethanol plants in Minnesota. The enforcement actions uncovered underreported emissions and resulted in consent decrees that required pollution control equipment be installed. A key component of the consent decrees was a requirement to conduct emissions tests for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with the goal of improving the characterization and control of emissions. The conventional VOC stack test method was thought to underquantify total VOC emissions from ethanol plants. A hybrid test method was also developed that involved quantification of individual VOC species. The resulting database of total and speciated VOC emissions from 10 fuel ethanol plants is relatively small, but it is the most extensive to date and has been used to develop and gauge compliance with permit limits and to estimate health risks in Minnesota. Emissions were highly variable among facilities and emissions units. In addition to the variability, the small number of samples and the presence of many values below detection limits complicate the analysis of the data. To account for these issues, a nested bootstrap procedure on the Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate means and upper confidence limits. In general, the fermentation scrubbers and fluid bed coolers emitted the largest mass of VOC emissions. Across most facilities and emissions units ethanol was the pollutant emitted at the highest rate. Acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate were also important emissions from some units. Emissions of total VOCs, ethanol, and some other species appeared to be a function of the beer feed rate, although the relationship was not reliable enough to develop a production rate-based emissions factor.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,The Economics of Harvesting and Transporting Corn Stover for Conversion to Fuel Ethanol: A Case Study for Minnesota,Biomass & Bioenergy,0961-9534,"Petrolia, DR",10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.12.012,8-Jul,Mississippi State University,University of Minnesota Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment,"Corn-stover feedstock costs were estimated for a proposed biomass-to-ethanol conversion facility in southern Minnesota, USA, accounting for county-specific yields and transportation distances, erosion constraints, machinery specifications, and transportation, storage, and densification costs.

In the National Cancer Institute's formaldehyde cohort, previously followed through December 31, 1979, and updated through December 31, 1994, formaldehyde exposure was associated with an increased risk for leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, that increased with peak and average intensity of exposure.  We extended follow-up through December 31, 2004 (median follow-up = 42 years), for 25 619 workers employed at one of 10 formaldehyde-using or formaldehyde-producing plants before 1966. We used Poisson regression to calculate relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine associations between quantitative formaldehyde exposure estimates (peak exposure, average intensity and cumulative exposure) and death from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered to be significant at P = .05.

Statistically nonsignificant associations were observed for multiple myeloma (RR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.01 to 4.12, P trend > .50), all leukemia (RR = 1.42; 95% CI = 0.92 to 2.18, P trend = .12), and myeloid leukemia (RR = 1.78; 95% CI = 0.87 to 3.64, P trend = .13). There was little evidence of association for any lymphohematopoietic malignancy with average intensity or cumulative exposure at the end of follow-up in 2004. However, disease associations varied over time. For peak exposure, the highest formaldehyde-related risks for myeloid leukemia occurred before 1980, but trend tests attained statistical significance in 1990 only. After the mid-1990s, the formaldehyde-related risk of myeloid leukemia declined.  Evaluation of risks over time suggests a possible link between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia but also perhaps Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

In the following years, several other plants including spinach, Solanum nigrum, Nicotiana excelsior, and Galinsoga parviflora were also found with symptoms of a similar nature. Symptoms were artificially reproduced in these plants on exposure to PAN proving that they were also sensitive to PAN. These PAN-type symptoms were prominently different from those caused by ozone or other general pollutants described in the literature. Based on these symptoms, PAN is believed to occur in all three major urban areas of Taiwan, namely Taipei in the north, Taichung in the center, and Kaohsiung in the south.

Results A total of 130 exposed workers and 51 age- and gender-matched unexposed subjects were recruited in this study. Benzene exposure levels monitored on the day of biological sample collection for exposed workers ranged from 0.06 to 122 ppm.

In addition, daily hospital admissions for respiratory causes, other community air pollutant measurements (e.g., ozone, O3), and meteorological data (e.g., temperature) were also obtained for these metropolitan areas. The summer months (June-August) were selected for analysis because that is when the highest H+ (and O3) are usually experienced at these sites, and because these months are rarely complicated by other major influences (e.g., high pollen counts). Thus, any pollution-admissions relationships were expected to be most clearly discernible in this season. Prior to the health effects analysis, the summer admissions and environmental data were first detrended to eliminate long-wave autocorrelations, and day-of-week effects were removed via regression.  Cross-correlations of the filtered 1988 and 1989 admissions and environmental data revealed strong associations between elevated summer haze pollution (i.e., H+, SO4=, and O3) and increased total respiratory and asthma admissions on the same day and/or on subsequent days in Buffalo and New York City, especially during the summer of 1988 (when pollution levels were more extreme). Regression analyses indicated that the pollution-admissions associations remained significant (p<0.05) even after the simultaneous inclusion of lagged daily maximum temperature. Mean effects calculations for these cities indicated that summertime haze can play a significant role in the occurrence of respiratory admissions in that season: accounting for an average 6 to 24% of 1988 Buffalo and NYC asthma admissions (depending on the pollutant index employed). O3 consistently had the highest mean effects estimates. Relative risk (RR) calculations indicated that the risk of admission for asthma was increased by a factor of 1.19 to 1.43 in these cities on maximum 1988 summertime pollution days, with H+ consistently having the highest RR estimates. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ambient acid aerosol peaks (eg., H+ greater-than-or-equal-to 100 nmol/m3) can potentiate the respiratory disease effects of O3.  Associations were weaker in the less urbanized Albany metropolitan area and in the New York City (NYC) suburbs, even though the NYC suburban O3 exposures were similar to (and the H+ concentrations may even be somewhat higher than) those in the center city. Examination of census data regarding the prevalence of poverty in these various areas suggested that localities having the highest percentages of the underprivileged in their urban cores are those in which the adverse effects of air pollution are most likely to result in hospital admissions for respiratory causes. This may reflect racial differences in pollution response, inadequate health care (e.g., due lo lack of insurance), poor nutrition, or some, as yet unidentified, factor associated with high population density.

Fine aerosol (d(a) < 2.5 mu m) samples were collected daily at a central city site during July and August 1986, 1987, and 1988 and were subsequently extracted and analyzed for daily particulate phase aerosol strong acidity (H+) and sulfates (SO4=). Daily counts of respiratory admissions to 22 acute care hospitals and daily meteorological and environmental data (e.g. ozone [O-3], total suspended particulate matter [TSP], and thoracic particle mass [PM10] were also obtained. Regression analyses indicated that only the O-3, H+, and SO4= associations with respiratory and asthma admissions remained consistently significant after controlling for temperature. Even after excluding days with maximum 1-hr O-3 > 120 ppb, O-3 was still strongly significant. In the various model specifications considered, the relative particle metric strengths of association with admissions were generally H+ > SO4= > FP > PM10 > TSP, indicating that particle size and composition are of central importance in defining the adverse human health effects of particulate matter. On average, summertime haze air pollution was associated with 24% of all respiratory admissions (21% with O-3, 3% with H+).

The programmatic objectives were to identify the best varieties and management practices to optimize productivity, while developing an understanding of the basis for long-term improvement of switchgrass through breeding and sustainable production in conventional agroecosysterns. This research has reduced the projected production cost of switchgrass by about 25% ($8-9 Mg-1) through yield increases of about 50% achieved through selection of the best regionally adapted varieties; through optimizing cutting frequency and timing; and by reducing the level (by about 40%) and timing of nitrogen fertilization. Breeding research has made further gains in productivity of switchgrass that exceed the historical rate of yield improvement of corn. Studies of soil carbon storage under switchgrass indicate significant carbon sequestration will occur in soils that will improve soil productivity and nutrient cycling and can substantially augment greenhouse gas reductions associated with substituting renewable energy for fossil energy. Collaborative research with industry has included fuel production and handling in power production, herbicide testing and licensing, release of new cultivars, and genetic modifications for chemical coproduct enhancement.

Lack of markets, concerns about sustained soil productivity, and lack of commercial conversion technologies have spread harvest of corn residues for this purpose. This paper reviews existing literature to evaluate the major precluded the wide environmental impacts potentially associated with stover harvest from reduced tillage corn production sites. Issues of greatest concern are erosion and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, the latter both for its role in soil quality and yield and for global carbon cycle implications. About half of the literature examined concerned research in the United States, many publications described research activities conducted for decades, and major soil types in corn producing regions were well represented. Regional differences were primarily temperature and rainfall effects on stand establishment and yield, with potential feedback effects on SOC. Several research papers discussing the effects of residue harvest were found, but few field studies were found that explicitly studied the effects of corn stover harvest and most discussions acknowledge potential tradeoffs among beneficial and adverse effects. It was concluded that more information is needed on several topics to determine potential long-term effects of residue harvest, including (1) erosion and water quality, especially pesticides and nitrate, (2) rates of transformation of different forms of SOC, (3) effects on soil biota, and (4) SOC dynamics in the subsoil.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Current and Potential US Corn Stover Supplies,Agronomy Journal,0002-1962,"Graham, RL; Nelson, R; Sheehan, J; Perlack, RD; Wright, LL",10.2134/argonj2005.0222,7-Jan,Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Kansas State University; National Renewable Energy Lab,US Department of Energy; Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Agricultural residues such as corn (Zea mays L.) stover are a potential feedstock for bioenergy and bio-based products that could reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Collection of such residues must take into account concerns that residue removal could increase erosion, reduce crop productivity, and deplete soil carbon and nutrients. This article estimates where and how much corn stover can be collected sustainably in the USA using existing commercial equipment and estimates costs of that collection. Erosion constraints to collection were considered explicitly, and crop productivity and soil nutrient constraints were considered implicitly, by recognizing the value of residues for maintaining soil moisture and including the cost of fertilizer to replace nutrients removed. Possible soil carbon loss was not considered in the analysis. With an annual production of 196 million Mg of corn grain (similar to 9.2 billion bushels), the USA produces 196 million Mg of stover. Under current rotation and tillage practices, similar to 30% of this stover could be collected for less than $33 Mg-1, taking into consideration erosion and soil moisture concerns and nutrient replacement costs. Wind erosion is a major constraint to stover collection. Analysis suggests three regions of the country (central Illinois, northern Iowa/southern Minnesota, and along the Platte River in Nebraska) produce sufficient stover to support large biorefineries with one million Mg per year feedstock demands and that if farmers converted to universal no-till production of corn, then over 100 million Mg of stover could be collected annually without causing erosion to exceed the tolerable soil loss.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Engineering aspects of collecting corn stover for bioenergy,Biomass & Bioenergy,0961-9534,"Sokhansanj, S; Turhollow, A; Cushman, J; Cundiff, J",10.1016/S0961-9534(02)00063-6,2002,Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Virginia Technical University,,"More than 216 million t (238 million tons) of corn stover (dry basis) is produced annually in the USA of which a portion could possibly be collected for conversion to ethanol and other industrial products.

It is shown that a typical sequence of shredding, windrowing and round baling operations may result in a collection efficiency of < 40%. Other factors such as weather, season, and leaving stover for environmental reasons may also reduce the amount of stover collected per unit area. Collection cost would depend on the amount of stover collected per unit area, the number of operations, machine efficiency in each operation, and bulk density.

The purpose of this article is to develop four ideas that are currently emerging from the work of a diverse group of plant scientists. (1) Air pollution definitions: The definition of air pollution has been broadened, and research activities are expanding to include analysis of plant responses to a wide range of atmospheric chemicals emitted from anthropogenic sources but not previously considered as air pollutants. Thus experiments with CO2 and other trace gases are being pursued with approaches developed in air pollution research. (2) Air pollution uptake: Efforts are increasing to better quantify air pollution absorption rates through stomata in order to calculate actual dose vs, plant responses. The flux rates of gaseous pollutants into leaves, especially O-3, are largely dependent upon stomatal conductance. Approaches are being developed to calculate stomatal absorption of gaseous pollutants, based on stomatal conductance values for water vapor and ambient air-pollution concentrations. Calculation of air pollution absorption rates will allow responses of plants to pollutants to be assessed in toxicological frameworks and will help characterize the strength of vegetation as sinks for some gaseous pollutants. (3) Compensatory responses: Plant responses to air pollutants can be interpreted as compensatory, i.e., a physiological adjustment to an environmental stress that maximizes productivity above that which would have occurred in the absence of compensation. Examples of compensatory responses to air pollutants are shifts in root-to-shoot ratio and accelerated rates of leaf maturation. Recognition of compensatory responses to air pollutants allows these responses to be placed in a framework that relates to whole-plant processes and ecosystem functions. (4) Air pollution and multiple stresses: Air pollution stress seldom occurs in isolation, and research approaches are being developed around the concept of multiple interacting stresses. Multiple-stress experiments are important because factors such as plant water status, light, and nutrient availability are known to alter plant responses to air pollutants. Multiple-stress studies will involve experiments with model plant species and high degrees of environmental control and monitoring.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,The benefits of pollution control: the case of ozone and U.S. agriculture,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,0002-9092,"Adams, RM; Hamilton, SA; McCarl, BA",10.2307/1242135,Nov-86,Oregon State University; Northwest Economic Associates; Texas A&M University,US Environmental Protection Agency,,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Use of US Croplands for biofuels increases greenhouse gases through emissions from land-use change,Science,0036-8075,"Searchinger, T; Heimlich, R; Houghton, RA; Dong, FX; Elobeid, A; Fabiosa, J; Tokgoz, S; Hayes, D; Yu, TH",10.1126/science.1151861,29-Feb-08,Princeton University; Agricultural Conservation Economics; Woods Hole Research Center; Iowa State University,National Aeronautical and Space Administration; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,"Most prior studies have found that substituting biofuels for gasoline will reduce greenhouse gases because biofuels sequester carbon through the growth of the feedstock.

By using a worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions from land- use change, we found that corn- based ethanol, instead of producing a 20% savings, nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years.

This article presents an overview of important issues that surround these disorders and emphasizes the structural and neurobehavioral consequences associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol. Diagnostic criteria are discussed, and possible moderating factors for the range of outcomes are mentioned. In addition, the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is described, and estimates of the financial impact of these disorders are given. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can severely affect the physical and neurobehavioral development of a child. Autopsy and brain imaging studies indicate reductions and abnormalities in overall brain size and shape, specifically in structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. A wide range of neuropsychological deficits have been found in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, including deficits in visuospatial functioning, verbal and nonverbal learning, attention, and executive functioning. These children also exhibit a variety of behavioral problems that can further affect their daily functioning. Children exposed to alcohol prenatally, with and without the physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome, display qualitatively similar deficits. Determining the behavioral phenotypes that result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is critical, because the identification of these children is crucial for early interventions. In addition, knowing which brain areas are involved might enable the development of better intervention strategies. However, intervention needs to go beyond the affected individual to prevent future cases. As evidenced by the staggering financial impact these disorders have on society, prevention efforts need to be aimed at high-risk groups, and this issue needs to be made a high priority in terms of public health.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Teratogenic effects of alcohol: a decade of brain imaging,American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C-Seminars in Medical Genetics,0148-7299,"Riley, EP; McGee, CL; Sowell, ER",10.1002/ajmg.c.30014,15-May-04,"San Diego State University; University of California, San Diego; University of California, Los Angeles",National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; EPR,"Heavy alcohol exposure can have serious and long-lasting effects on the developing fetal brain.

Most recently, we have utilized novel imaging and analytic techniques to study the brain as a whole in an effort to elucidate more subtle differences than was possible with earlier techniques. Results indicated displacements in the corpus callosum, increased gray matter densities in both hemispheres in the perisylvian regions, and altered gray matter asymmetry in portions of the temporal lobes in the brains of alcohol-exposed subjects. In addition, prominent shape abnormalities were observed in the brains of these subjects, with narrowing in the temporal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe.

Here, a nested global-through-urban air pollution/weather forecast model is combined with high-resolution future emission inventories, population data, and health effects data to examine the effect of converting from gasoline to E85 on cancer, mortality, and hospitalization in the United States as a whole and Los Angeles in particular. Under the base-case emission scenario derived, which accounted for projected improvements in gasoline and E85 vehicle emission controls, it was found that E85 (85% ethanol fuel, 15% gasoline) may increase ozone-related mortality, hospitalization, and asthma by about 9% in Los Angeles and 4% in the United States as a whole relative to 100% gasoline. Ozone increases in Los Angeles and the northeast were partially offset by decreases in the southeast. E85 also increased peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in the U.S. but was estimated to cause little change in cancer risk. Due to its ozone effects, future E85 may be a greater overall public health risk than gasoline. However, because of the uncertainty in future emission regulations, it can be concluded with confidence only that E85 is unlikely to improve air quality over future gasoline vehicles.

Ethanol trade represented about 10% of world consumption in 2005, Brazil being the main exporter. The most important consumer markets-US and European Union (EU)-have trade regimes that constrained the comparative advantages of the most efficient producers, such as Brazil. This paper evaluates the fuel ethanol market up to 2030 together with the potential for international biotrade. Based on forecasts of gasoline consumption and on targets and mandates of fuel ethanol use, it is estimated that demand could reach 272 Gl in 2030, displacing 10% of the estimated demand of gasoline (Scenario 1), or even 566Gl in the same year, displacing about 20% of the gasoline demand (Scenario 2). The analysis considers fuel ethanol consumption and production in US, EU-25, Japan, China, Brazil and the rest of the world (ROW-BR). Without significant production of ethanol from cellulosic materials in this period, displacing 10% of the gasoline demand in 2030, at reasonable cost, can only be accomplished by fostering fuel ethanol production in developing countries and enhancing ethanol trade. If the US and EU-25 reach their full production potential (based on conventional routes), the minimum amount that could be traded in 2030 would be about 34Gl. Displacing 20% of the gasoline demand by 2030 will require the combined development of second-generation technologies and large-scale international trade in ethanol fuel. Without second-generation technologies, Scenario 2 could become a reality only with large-scale production of ethanol from sugarcane in developing countries, e.g., Brazil and ROW-BR could be able to export at least. 14.5 Gl in 2010, 73.9 Gl in 2020 and 71.8 Gl in 2030.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,"Effects on Biodiversity of Forest Fuel Extraction, Governed by Processes Working on a Large Scale",Biomass & Bioenergy,0961-9534,"Jonsell, M",10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.06.01,7-Oct,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,EU Project WOOD-EN-MAN; Swedish Energy Agency,"The question whether forest fuel extraction will affect biodiversity is ultimately a question of whether there will be species extinctions due to this practice.

A model was developed to analyse decision-making among these private forest Owners. The model covers five factors: economics, transaction costs, concerns about soil fertility, forestry, and previous experience. It was applied in a survey among forest owners in four communities in central Sweden in 1999. Wood fuels had been sold from 60% of the estates. Analysis suggests that the price paid had little influence on the decision to sell. Transaction costs had been alleviated by the traditional timber buyer organizing the fuel trade, and by minimizing measurement in the forest. The primary reason for selling wood fuel was that the harvesting operation cleared the ground of debris, There is a general concern for loss in soil fertility due to wood fuel harvesting which is why some owners do not sell forest fuels. Two types of fuel-selling forest owners were identified: (1) an active manager seeking different gains from wood fuel harvest, and (2) an owner who primarily relies an the advice of the timber buyer. The findings indicate that large-scale traders of wood fuels have to be active in increasing supply, making direct contact with forest owners, and connecting trade with information on ecological and silvicultural effects.

Although CO generated from neuronal heme oxygenase can modulate neurotransmission, evidence supporting its role in cerebral vasodilation is limited. In newborn piglets, heme oxygenase is enriched in microvessels and contributes to hypoxic vasodilation. Low CO concentrations dilate piglet arterioles by opening calcium-activated potassium channels. With inhalation of CO and formation of carboxyhemoglobin, cerebral vasodilation can be greater than that occurring with hypoxic hypoxia at equivalent reductions of arterial oxygen content. This additional vasodilation is probably attributable to additional release of hypoxic vasodilators secondary to increased oxyhemoglobin affinity, although direct effects of CO on cerebral arterioles may also occur. When CO exposure is prolonged, cerebral endothelium undergoes oxidant stress as evident by nitrotyrosine formation. As CO levels increase, modest decreases in oxygen consumption are detectable, which may reflect CO or nitric oxide interactions with cytochrome oxidase in regions with very low oxygen availability. If subsequent CO concentration increases sufficiently to depress cardiac function and limit cerebral perfusion, cerebral oxygen consumption becomes further reduced, and oxidant stress becomes amplified by leukocyte sequestration and xanthine oxidase activity with consequent lipid peroxidation.

The mean time weighted average formaldehyde exposure at the plants in the early 1980s was 0.15 ppm but past exposures may have been substantially higher.  Methods: Vital status was updated through 1998, and life table analyses were conducted.  Results: Mortality from all causes (2206 deaths, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.96) and all cancers (SMR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) was less than expected based on US mortality rates. A non-significant increase in mortality from myeloid leukaemia (15 deaths, SMR 1.44, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.37) was observed. Mortality from myeloid leukaemia was greatest among workers first exposed in the earliest years when exposures were presumably higher, among workers with 10 or more years of exposure, and among workers with 20 or more years since first exposure. No nasal or nasopharyngeal cancers were observed. Mortality from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer (147 deaths, SMR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15) was not increased. Multiple cause mortality from leukaemia was increased almost twofold among workers with both 10 or more years of exposure and 20 years or more since first exposure (15 deaths, SMR 1.92, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.17). Multiple cause mortality from myeloid leukaemia among this group of workers was also significantly increased (8 deaths, SMR 2.55, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.03).  Conclusions: Results support a possible relation between formaldehyde exposure and myeloid leukaemia mortality. Previous epidemiological studies supporting a relation between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia mortality have been primarily of formaldehyde exposed professional groups, not formaldehyde exposed industrial workers.

However, most studies have been conducted on males. Only recently have studies begun to investigate the influence of alcohol on endocrine function in females and, more specifically, endocrine function during pregnancy. Alcohol-induced endocrine imbalances may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol crosses the placenta and can directly affect developing fetal cells and tissues. Alcohol-induced changes in maternal endocrine function can disrupt maternal-fetal hormonal interactions and affect the female's ability to maintain a successful pregnancy, thus indirectly affecting the fetus.  In this review, we focus on the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neuroendocrine and immune function, with particular emphasis on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the concept of fetal programming. The HPA axis is highly susceptible to programming during fetal development. Early environmental experiences, including exposure to alcohol, can reprogram the HPA axis such that HPA tone is increased throughout life. We present data that demonstrate that maternal alcohol consumption increases HPA activity in both the maternal female and the offspring. Increased exposure to endogenous glucocorticoids throughout the lifespan can alter behavioral and physiologic responsiveness and increase vulnerability to illnesses or disorders later in life. Alterations in immune function may be one of the long-term consequences of fetal HPA programming. We discuss studies that demonstrate the adverse effects of alcohol on Immune competence and the increased vulnerability of ethanol-exposed offspring to the immunosuppressive effects of stress. Fetal programming of HPA activity may underlie some of the long-term behavioral, cognitive, and immune deficits that are observed following prenatal alcohol exposure.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,"A physiological and morphological study on the injury caused by exposure to the air pollutant, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), based on the quantitative assessment of the injury",Journal of Plant Research,0918-9440,"Oka, E; Tagami, Y; Oohashi, T; Kondo, N",10.1007/s10265-003-0127-1,4-Feb,"The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; The Tokyo Metropolitan Research Institute for Environmental Protection",,"A method for the numerical assessment of the foliar injury caused by the photochemical oxidant, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), was devised, using three injury indices: fresh weight (FW) loss, decreased photosynthetic pigment content, and increased ion leakage, which can be measured using the same leaves.

FW and photosynthetic pigment content decreased correlatively in both varieties, but ion leakage increased only in WHITE. Morphological observations revealed that ion leakage started concurrently with the start of plasmolysis-like symptoms at the mesophyll cells of injured WHITE leaves, whereas FW loss corresponded to the shrinkage of cells without loss of their round shape in BLUE leaves. PAN injuries measured by the injury indices were markedly increased in the presence of light, and the morphological changes following PAN exposure were similar to those caused by the superoxide-generating chemical, paraquat.

We designed two indicators of environmental profitability: a) the Intergenerational Transfer Amount (ITA), which quantifies in monetary units what the current generation is willing to pass on future generations when an environmental restoration project is carried out, and b) the Critical Environmental Rate (CER), measures the implicit environmental profitability. These concepts were tested through an empirical case study pertaining to the assessment of an Erosion Control Project in the southeast of Spain. The results yield traditional profitability indicators that are higher - and probably closer - to the real values set by the contemporary society.

The secondary contribution increases during the morning and reaches a maximum in the early afternoon. As a consequence, total acetaldehyde and formaldehyde levels peak after the primary pollutants' maximum, obtained in the early morning, and before the secondary pollutants' maximum as previously noted in experimental determinations.

Three biomass collection systems: baling, loafing and ensiling are evaluated. The number and operational performance of equipment are specified to complete collection operations within 120 days of harvest after August 1. Bales are stacked and tarped on the farm side. The transport of biomass from the farm side to a biorefinery takes place over a full year cycle, i.e. 365 days. Supply quantities range from 454 to 4540 dry tonnes/day (500-5000 dry tons/day). Delivered costs to a biorefinery with capacity of 1814 dry tonnes/day (2000 dry tons/day) are: $44-$47/dry tonne for delivered bales (round and square); $37/dry tonne for delivered loafs (size 2.4m x 3.6m x 6m); $40/dry tonne for chopped biomass; and $48/dry tonne for ensiled chops. These costs do not include any payment to the farmers or switchgrass farming cost. Based on the data from literature, the switchgrass farming cost can range from $30 to $36/dry tonne. These costs would be additional to the switchgrass collection and transportation cost. Switchgrass collection is generally less expensive than collection of straw or corn stover because of the assumed high yield of 11 dry tonnes/ha and a denser biomass. Energy consumption for delivery systems at this capacity ranges from 4.8% to 6.3% of the energy content of switchgrass. Additional 1% of the energy content of switchgrass is consumed in its farming.

Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon- flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity ( the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old- growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old- growth forests(7). Half of the primary forests (6 x 10(8) hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 +/- 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity(8).

The estimated warming of 2.4 degrees C is the equilibrium warming above preindustrial temperatures that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1.4 degrees C to 4.3 degrees C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1 degrees C to 3 degrees C for dangerous anthropogenic interference with many of the climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan-Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet.

This paper emphasizes the deleterious effects of predominantly high levels of soil compaction on plant growth and yield. High levels of soil compaction are common in heavily used recreation areas, construction sites, urban areas, timber harvesting sites, fruit orchards, agroforestry systems and tree nurseries. Compaction call occur naturally by settling or slumping of soil or may be induced by tillage tools, heavy machinery, pedestrian traffic, trampling by animals and fire. Compaction typically alters soil structure and hydrology by increasing soil bulk density; breaking down soil aggregates; decreasing soil porosity, aeration and infiltration capacity; and by increasing soil strength, water runoff and soil erosion. Appreciable compaction of soil leads to physiological dysfunctions in plants. Often, but not always, reduced water absorption and leaf water deficits develop. Soil compaction also induces changes in the amounts and balances of growth hormones in plants, especially increases in abscisic acid and ethylene. Absorption of the major mineral nutrients is reduced by compaction of both surface soils and subsoils. The rate of photosynthesis of plants growing in very compacted soil is decreased by both stomatal and non-stomatal inhibition. Total photosynthesis is reduced as a result of smaller leaf areas. As soils become increasingly compacted respiration of roots shifts toward an anaerobic state. Severe soil compaction adversely influences regeneration of forest stands by inhibiting seed germination and growth of seedlings, and by inducing seedling mortality. Growth of woody plants beyond the seedling stage and yields of harvestable plant products also are greatly decreased by soil compaction because of the combined effects of high soil strength, decreased infiltration of water and poor soil aeration, all of which lead to a decreased supply of physiological growth requirements at meristematic sites. Many protocols have been developed, with variable success, to alleviate the adverse effects of soil compaction on the growth and development of woody plants. These include planting of compaction-tolerant species, controlling vehicular and animal traffic, amending soils by adding coarse materials and/or organic matter, replacing compacted soils with uncompacted soils, loosening soils with aerating equipment, installing drainage systems and judiciously applying fertilizers. Prevention of soil compaction before planting is usually much preferred over post-planting treatments because the latter are expensive and difficult to apply, may not be adequately effective and may injure plant roots.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Time Course of ozone-induced neutrophilia in normal humans,American Review of Respiratory Disease,0003-0805,"Schelegle, ES; Siefkin, AD; McDonald, RJ",,Jun-91,"University of California, Davis",National Institutes of Health,"Five normal human subjects were exposed for 1 h to filtered air (FA) once and to 0.3 ppm O3 on 3 separate days.

The first aliquot [proximal airway (PA) sample] was analyzed separately from the pooled Aliquots 2 through 4 [distal airway and alveolar surface (DAAS) sample]. The data from the PA and DAAS samples were then combined to calculate the values that would have been obtained by pooling all BAL washes.

These projects provide particularly useful opportunities for measuring commuters' values of time and reliability. Unlike most revealed preference studies of value of time, the choice to pay to use the toll facilities in these demonstrations is relatively independent from other travel choices such as whether to use public transit. Unlike most stated preference studies, the scenarios presented in these surveys are real ones that travelers have faced or know about from media coverage. By combining revealed and stated preference data, some of the studies have obtained enough independent variation in variables to disentangle effects of cost, time, and reliability, while still grounding the results in real behavior.

Peroxyacetyl nitrate caused inhibition to photophosphorylation in either the dark or the light by affecting the chloroplast.  Evidence is presented which suggests that peroxyacetyl nitrate could oxidize sulfhydryl groups on enzymes necessary for photophosphorylation.  The inhibition to photophosphorylation caused by peroxyacetyl nitrate cannot be reversed by glutathione, even when added in large amounts, whereas the inhibition to photophosphorylation caused by para-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid is easily reversed by small quantities of glutathlone.

Economists tend to think that, as a general rule, such benefits should be discounted in the same way as money; many philosophers and lawyers doubt that conclusion on empirical and normative grounds. Both sides frequently neglect a simple point: if regulators are interested in how people currently value risks that will not come to fruition for a significant time, they can use people's current willingness to pay to reduce those risks. And if the question involves people's willingness to pay in the future, what is being discounted is merely money, not regulatory benefits as such. No one seeks to discount health and life as such-only the money that might be used to reduce threats to these goods. If willingness to pay to reduce risk is the appropriate metric for allocating regulatory resources, discounting merely adjusts that metric to make expenditures comparable through time. To be sure, cost-benefit analysis with discounting can produce serious problems of intergenerational equity; but those problems, involving the obligations of the present to the future, require an independent analysis. Failing to discount will often hurt, rather than help, future generations, and solutions to the problem of intergenerational equity should not be conflated with the question of whether to discount.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,A comparison of proximity and land use regression traffic exposure models and wheezing in infants,Environmental Health Perspectives,0091-6765,"Ryan, PH; LeMasters, GK; Biswas, P; Levin, L; Hu, SH: Lindsey, M; Bernstein, DL; Lockey, J; Villareal, M; Hershey, GKK; Grinshpun, SA",10.1289/ehp.9480,7-Feb,University of Cincinnati Medical Center; Washington University in St. Louis; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported an association between infant wheezing and residence < 100 m from stop-and-go bus and truck traffic. The use of a proximity model, however, may lead to exposure misclassification. OBJECTIVE: Results obtained from a land use regression (LUR) model of exposure to truck and bus traffic are compared with those obtained with a proximity model. The estimates derived from the LUR model were then related to infant wheezing. METHODS: We derived a marker of diesel combustion-elemental carbon attributable to traffic sources (ECAT)-from ambient monitoring results of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m. We developed a multiple regression model with ECAT as the outcome variable. Variables included in the model were locations of major roads, bus routes, truck traffic count, and elevation. Model parameter estimates were applied to estimate individual ECAT levels at infants' homes. RESULTS: The levels of estimated ECAT at the monitoring stations ranged from 0.20 to 1.02 mu g/m(3). A LUR model of exposure with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.75 was applied to infants' homes. The mean (+/- SD) ambient exposure of ECAT for infants previously categorized as unexposed, exposed to stop-and-go traffic, or exposed to moving traffic was 0.32 +/- 0.06, 0.42 +/- 0.14, and 0.49 +/- 0.14 mu g/m(3), respectively. Levels of ECAT from 0.30 to 0.90 mu g/m(3) were significantly associated with infant wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: The LUR model resulted in a range of ECAT individually derived for all infants' homes that may reduce the exposure misclassification that can arise from a proximity model.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Synergistic action of the benzene metabolite hydroquinone on myelopoietic stimulating activity of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor in vitro,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,0027-8424,"Irons, RD; Stillman, WS; Colagiovanni, DB; Henry, VA",10.1073/pnas.89.9.3691,1-May-92,University of Colorado Health Sciences Center,American Petroleum Institute; Chemical Manufacturers Association; Center for Space Environmental Health/National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"The effects of in vitro pretreatment with benzene metabolites on colony-forming response of murine bone marrow cells stimulated with recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) were examined. Pretreatment with hydroquinone (HQ) at concentrations ranging from picomolar to micromolar for 30 min resulted in a 1.5- to 4.6-fold enhancement in colonies formed in response to rGM-CSF that was due to an increase in granulocyte/macrophage colonies. The synergism equaled or exceeded that reported for the effects of interleukin 1, interleukin 3, or interleukin 6 with GM-CSF. Optimal enhancement was obtained with 1-mu-M HQ and was largely independent of the concentration of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment with other authentic benzene metabolites, phenol and catechol, and the putative metabolite trans,trans-muconaldehyde did not enhance growth factor response. Coadministration of phenol and HQ did not enhance the maximal rGM-CSF response obtained with HQ alone but shifted the optimal concentration to 100 pM. Synergism between HQ and rGM-CSF was observed with nonadherent bone marrow cells and lineage-depleted bone marrow cells, suggesting an intrinsic effect on recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells not normally responsive to rGM-CSF.

The fine particle organic mass concentration present in the 1993 annual average Los Angeles-area composite sample was apportioned among eight emission source types. The largest source contributions to fine particulate organic compound mass concentration were identified as smoke from meat cooking, diesel-powered vehicle exhaust, wood smoke, and paved road dust. However, the largest source contributions to the mutagenicity of the atmospheric sample were natural gas combustion and diesel-powered vehicles. In both the human cell and bacterial assay systems, the combined mutagenicity of the composite of primary source effluents predicted to be present in the atmosphere was statistically indistinguishable from the mutagenicity of the actual atmospheric sample composite. Known primary emissions sources appear to be capable of emitting mutagenic organic matter to the urban atmosphere in amounts sufficient to account for the observed mutagenicity of the ambient samples. The error bounds on this analysis, however, are wide enough to admit to the possible importance of additional mutagenic organics that are formed by atmospheric reaction (e.g., 2-nitrofluoranthene has been identified as an important human cell mutagen in the atmospheric composite studied here, accounting for similar to 1 % of the total sample mutagenic potency).",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Immediate sensory nerve-mediated respiratory responses to irritants in healthy and allergic airway-diseased mice,Journal of Applied Physiology,8750-7587,"Morris, JB; Symanowicz, PT; Olsen, JE; Thrall, RS; Cloutier, MM; Hubbard, AK",10.1152/japplphysiol.00572.2002,3-Apr,University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut Health Center,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"The immediate responses of the upper respiratory tract (URT) to the irritants acrolein and acetic acid were examined in healthy and allergic airway-diseased C57BI/6J mice.

This article provides an overview of the most important results and experience gained with miscanthus in Europe over the past 10 years. Field trials have been established throughout Europe from the Mediterranean to southern Scandinavia. Most reported trials have used a vigorous sterile clone Miscanthus x giganteus, which has been propagated vegetatively either by rhizome cutting or in vitro culture. Yields in autumn have been reported in excess of 30 tha(-1) (12 t acre(-1)) for irrigated trials in southern Europe. Without irrigation autumn yields of 10-25 tha(-1) (dry matter) can be expected. The quality of miscanthus biomass for combustion is in some respect comparable to woody biomass and normally improves by delaying harvesting until the spring, although harvestable yields are thus reduced by 30-50% compared with autumn yields. Different technical options for establishment, harvesting and handling of miscanthus have been developed and these significantly effect production costs. Miscanthus production is characterized by low fertilizer and pesticide requirements making it a relatively benign crop environmentally. The main limitations to miscanthus production from M. x giganteus are the high establishment costs, poor over-wintering at some sites and insufficient water supply in southern regions of Europe. New agronomic techniques and new genotypes with improved characteristics are being developed and screened over the wide range of ecological conditions in Europe.

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a ""one-atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation.

Plume dimensions were determined for gasoline-contaminated sites to evaluate the effect of ethanol on benzene and toluene plume lengths. Data from 217 sites in Iowa (without ethanol; set 1) were compared to data from 29 sites in Kansas that were contaminated by ethanol-amended gasoline (10% ethanol by volume; set 2). The data were log-normally distributed, with mean benzene plume lengths ( standard deviation) of 193 +/- 135 feet for set 1 and 263 +/- 103 feet for set 2 (36% longer). The median lengths were 156 feet and 263 feet (69% longer), respectively. Mean toluene plume lengths were 185 +/- 131 feet for set 1 and 211 +/- 99 feet for set 2 (14% longer), and the median lengths were 158 feet and 219 feet (39% longer), respectively. Thus, ethanol-containing BTEX plumes were significantly longer for benzene (p < 0.05), but not for toluene. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that toluene plumes were generally shorter than benzene plumes, which suggests that toluene was attenuated to a greater extent than benzene. This trend was more pronounced for set 2 (with ethanol), which may reflect that benzene attenuation is more sensitive to the depletion of electron acceptors caused by ethanol degradation. These results support the hypothesis that the presence of ethanol in gasoline can lead to longer benzene plumes. The importance of this effect, however, is probably site-specific, largely depending on the release scenario and the available electron acceptor pool.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Corn Stover Availability and Collection Efficiency Using Typical Hay Equipment,Transactions of the ASABE,0001-2351,"Prewitt, RM; Montross, MD; Shearer, SA; Stombaugh, TS; Higgins, SF; McNeill, SG; Sokhansanj, S",,7-May,University of Kentucky; Oak Ridge National Laboratory,Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Corn stover has been identified as a potential feedstock for the production of fermentable sugars and thermochemical processes.

In this study, we combined leaf-level ozone response data from independent ozone fumigation studies with a forest ecosystem model in order simulate the effects of ambient ozone on mature hardwood forests. Reductions in leaf carbon gain were determined as a linear function of ozone flux to the leaf interior, calculated as the product of ozone concentration and leaf stomatal conductance. This relationship was applied to individual canopy layers within the model in order to allow interaction with stand-and canopy-level factors such as light attenuation, leaf morphology, soil water limitations, and vertical ozone gradients.  The resulting model was applied to 64 locations across the northeastern United States using ambient ozone data from 1987 to 1992. Predicted declines in annual net primary production ranged from 3 to 16% with greatest reductions in southern portions of the region where ozone levels were highest, and on soils with high water-holding capacity where drought stress was absent. Reductions in predicted wood growth were slightly greater (3-22%) because wood is a lower carbon allocation priority in the model than leaf and root growth. Interannual variation in predicted ozone effects was small due to concurrent fluctuations in ozone and climate, Periods of high ozone often coincided with hot, dry weather conditions, causing reduced stomatal conductance and ozone uptake. Within-canopy ozone concentration gradients had little effect on predicted growth reductions because concentrations remained high through upper canopy layers where net carbon assimilation and ozone uptake were greatest.  Sensitivity analyses indicate a trade-off between model sensitivity to available soil water and foliar nitrogen and demonstrate uncertainties regarding several assumptions used in the model. Uncertainties surrounding ozone effects on stomatal function and plant water use efficiency were found to have important implications on current predictions, Field measurements of ozone effects on mature forests will be needed before the accuracy of model predictions can be fully assessed.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Particulate matter exposure in cars associated with cardiovascular effects in health young men,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Riediker, M; Cascio, WE; Griggs, TR; Herbst, MC; Bromberg, PA; Neas, L; Williams, RW; Devlin, RB",10.1164/rccm.200310-1463OC,15-Apr-04,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; North Carolina State Highway Patrol; US Environmental Protection Agency",US Environmental Protection Agency; Swiss National Science Foundation,"Exposure to fine airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in older and cardiac patients.

Several recent studies have suggested that in estimating exposure dose (O3 concentration [C] x exposure time [T] x ventilation [V]), O3 concentration needs to be weighted more heavily than either ventilation or duration of exposure in the estimates. In this study we tested the hypothesis that regardless of concentration pattern and exposure rate the same exposure dose of O3 will induce the same spirometric response. We exposed 23 healthy male volunteers (20 to 35 yr of age) for 8 h to air, 0.12 ppm O3 (steady-state), and a triangular exposure pattern (concentration increased steadily from zero to 0.24 ppm over the first 4 h and decreased back to zero by 8 h). During the first 30 min of each hour, subjects exercised for 30 min at minute ventilation (VE) approximately 40 L/min. The order of the exposures was randomized, and the exposures were separated by at least 7 days. The response patterns over the 8-h periods for spirometric variables in both O3 exposures were statistically different from air exposure changes and from each other. For FEV1 the p values were 0.017 between air and steady-state profile, 0.002 between air and triangular profile, and 0.037 between steady-state and triangular profiles. Although in the triangular pattern of exposure the maximal O3 concentration was reached at 4 h, the maximum FEV1 decrement (10.2%) was observed at 6 h of exposure. Our observations demonstrate that the product of CBAR (mean) x T x V is not a sufficient index of exposure. At low O3 concentrations the key determinant of spirometric changes appears to be averaged exposure rate (ppm x L x h-1).",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Atmospheric Deposition of Nitrogen: Implications for Nutrient Over-Enrichment of Coastal Waters,Estuaries ,0160-8347,"Paerl, HW; Dennis, RL; Whitall, DR",10.1007/BF02804899,2-Aug,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; US Environmental Protection Agency; Syracuse University",National Science Foundation; US Department of Agriculture; US Environmental Protection Agency; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; The Environmental Defense Fund; North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development; University of North Carolina Water Resources Research Institute,"Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (AD-N) is a significant source of nitrogen enrichment to nitrogen (N)-limited estuarine and coastal waters downwind of anthropogenic emissions. Along the eastern U.S. coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, AD-N currently accounts for 10% to over 40% of new N loading to estuaries. Extension of the regional acid deposition model (RADM) to coastal shelf waters indicates that 11, 5.6, and 5.6 kg N ha(-1) may be deposited on the continental shelf areas of the northeastern U.S. coast, southeast U.S. coast, and eastern Gulf of Mexico, respectively. AD-N approximates or exceeds riverine N inputs in many coastal regions. From a spatial perspective, AD-N is a unique source of N enrichment to estuarine and coastal waters because, for a receiving water body, the airshed may exceed the watershed by 10-20 fold. AD-N may originate far outside of the currently managed watersheds. AD-N may increase in importance as a new N source by affecting waters downstream of the oligohaline and mesohaline estuarine nutrient filters where large amounts of terrestrially-supplied N are assimilated and denitrified. Regionally and globally, N deposition associated with urbanization (NO(x), peroxyacetyl nitrate, or PAN) and agricultural expansion (NH(4)(+) and possibly organic N) has increased in coastal airsheds. Recent growth and intensification of animal (poultry, swine, cattle) operations in the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions have led to increasing amounts of NH(4)(+) emission and deposition, according to a three decadal analysis of the National Acid Deposition Program network. In western Europe, where livestock operations have dominated agricultural production for the better part of this century, NH(4)(+) is the most abundant form of AD-N. AD-N deposition in the U.S. is still dominated by oxides of N (NO(x)) emitted from fossil fuel combustion; annual NH(4)(+) deposition is increasing, and in some regions is approaching total NO(3)(-) deposition. In receiving estuarine and coastal waters, phytoplankton community structural and functional changes, associated water quality, and trophic and biogeochemical alterations (i.e., algal blooms, hypoxia, food web, and fisheries habitat disruption) are frequent consequences of N-driven eutrophication. Increases in and changing proportions of various new N sources regulate phytoplankton competitive interactions, dominance, and successional patterns. These quantitative and qualitative aspects of AD-N and other atmospheric nutrient sources (e.g., iron) may promote biotic changes now apparent in estuarine and coastal waters, including the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, with cascading impacts on water quality and fisheries.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Mechanisms of carbon monoxide toxicity,Preventative Medicine,0091-7435,"Corburn, RF",10.1016/0091-7435(79)90008-2,1979,University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,National Institutes of Health,,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Extended follow-up of a cohort of British chemical workers exposed to formaldehyde,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,0027-8874,"Coggon, D; Harris, EC; Poole, J; Palmer, KT",10.1093/jnci/djg046,5-Nov-03,"University of Southampton, Southampton, UK",Colt Foundation,"Background: Formaldehyde is mutagenic and, when inhaled at high concentrations, carcinogenic in rats. Some epidemiologic studies have linked occupational exposure to formaldehyde with cancers of the nose, nasopharynx, and lung, but the evidence for human carcinogenicity has been inconsistent and requires clarification. Methods: We extended by 11 years the follow-up of an existing cohort of 14 014 men employed after 1937 at six British factories where formaldehyde was produced or used. Subjects had been identified from employment records, and their jobs had been classified for potential exposure to formaldehyde. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were derived using the person-years method and were compared with the expected numbers of deaths for the national population. Results: During follow-up through December 31, 2000, 5185 deaths were recorded, including two from sino-nasal cancer (2.3 expected) and one from nasopharyngeal cancer (2.0 expected). Relative to the national population, mortality from lung cancer was increased among those who worked with formaldehyde, particularly in men in the highest of four estimated exposure categories (>2 ppm) (SMR = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.40 to 1.78), and the increase persisted after adjustment for local geographic variations in mortality (SMR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.13 to 1.44). However, there was a statistically nonsignificant decrease in the risk of death from lung cancer with duration of high exposure (P-trend =.18), and this risk showed no trend with time since first high exposure (P-trend =.99). Conclusions: The evidence for human carcinogenicity of formaldehyde remains unconvincing. Although a small effect on sino-nasal or nasopharyngeal cancer cannot be ruled out, a possible increase in the risk of lung cancer is a greater concern.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Ambient air pollution and atherosclerosis in Los Angeles,Environmental Health Perspectives,0091-6765,"Kunzli, N; Jerrett, M; Mack, WJ; Beckerman, B; LaBree, L; Gilliland, F; Thomas, D; Peters, J; Hodis, HN",10.1289/ehp.7523,5-Feb,University of Southern California,National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Wright Foundation; Hastings Foundation; Health Effects Institute,"Associations have been found between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The contribution of air pollution to atherosclerosis that underlies many cardiovascular diseases h as not been investigated. Animal data suggest that ambient particulate matter (PM) may contribute to atherogenesis. We used data on 798 participants from two clinical trials to investigate the association between atherosclerosis and long-term exposure to ambient PM up to 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Baseline data included assessment of the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. We geocoded subjects' residential areas to assign annual mean concentrations of ambient PM2.5. Exposure values were assigned from a PM2.5 surface derived from a geostatistical model. Individually assigned annual mean PM2.5 Concentrations ranged from 5.2 to 26.9 mug/m(3) (mean, 20.3). For a cross-sectional exposure contrast of 10 mug/m(3) PM2.5, CIMT increased by 5.9% (95% confidence interval, 1-11%). Adjustment for age reduced the coefficients, but further adjustment for covariates indicated robust estimates in the range of 3.9-4.3% (p-values, 0.05-0.1). Among older subjects (greater than or equal to 60 years of age), women, never smokers, and those reporting lipid-lowering treatment at baseline, the associations of PM2.5 and CIMT were larger with the strongest associations in women greater than or equal to 60 years of age (15.7%, 5.7-26.6%).

To test this hypothesis, we modeled the association between air pollution and mortality using small-area exposure measures in Los Angeles California.  Methods: Data on 22,905 subjects were extracted from the American Cancer Society cohort for the period 1982-2000 (5,856 deaths). Pollution exposures were interpolated from 23 fine particle (PM2.5) and 42 ozone (O-3) fixed-site monitors. Proximity to expressways was tested as a measure of traffic pollution. We assessed associations in standard and spatial multilevel Cox regression models.  Results: After controlling for 44 individual covariates, all-cause mortality had a relative risk (RR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.30) for an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) PM2.5 and a RR of 1.11 (0.99-1.25) with maximal control for both individual and contextual confounders. The RRs for mortality resulting from ischemic heart disease and lung cancer deaths were elevated, in the range of 1.24-1.6, depending on the model used. These PM results were robust to adjustments for O-3 and expressway exposure.  Conclusion: Our results suggest the chronic health effects associated with within-city gradients in exposure to PM2.5 may be even larger than previously reported across metropolitan areas. We observed effects nearly 3 times greater than in models relying on comparisons between communities.

With a marginal cost approach, the cost of common harvesting activities such as felling, forwarding and processing/sorting are fully allocated to the conventional products. Under a joint product approach, the cost of production is distributed among conventional products and fuel wood. A model is developed showing the distribution of cost under both approaches for seven integrated harvesting systems. The results suggest that production costs are highly variable depending on the harvesting system used and the ratio of conventional products to fuel wood.

The first method assumes that all of the fine particulate matter mass that cannot be attributed to sulfate ion, nitrate ion, ammonium ion, elemental carbon and metal oxides is organic matter. Using this method, 98 daily samples were used to estimate the annual average fine particulate matter OM/OC ratio to be 1.81 +/- 0.07 with a summer average of 1.95 +/- 0.17 and a winter average of 1.77 +/- 0.13. The second approach to estimating fine particle OM/ OC employed OC source apportionment results and estimates of source specific OM/ OC, including primary sources and secondary organic aerosol. The OM/ OC estimate that was based on 98 daily source apportionment calculations over a two year period yielded an annual average ratio of 1.96 +/- 0.03. Methods used in the study yielded a relatively stable annual average estimate of the OM/ OC ratio for fine particulate matter in the St. Louis area. The source apportionment results indicate that the similar OM/ OC ratio for St. Louis in the summer and winter results from an increased relative contribution of secondary organic aerosol in the summer months that is balanced by the higher woodsmoke in the winter.

It consists of the simple alkyl esters of fatty acids, most typically the methyl esters. We have developed a computer model to estimate the capital and operating costs of a moderately-sized industrial biodiesel production facility. The major process operations in the plant were continuous-process vegetable oil transesterification, and ester and glycerol recovery. The model was designed using contemporary process simulation software, and current reagent, equipment and supply costs, following current production practices. Crude, degummed soybean oil was specified as the feedstock. Annual production capacity of the plant was set at 37,854,118 1 (10 x 106 gal). Facility construction costs were calculated to be US$11.3 million. The largest contributors to the equipment cost, accounting for nearly one third of expenditures, were storage tanks to contain a 25 day capacity of feedstock and product. At a value of US$0.52/kg ($0.236/lb) for feedstock soybean oil, a biodiesel production cost of US$0.53/l ($2.00/gal) was predicted. The single greatest contributor to this value was the cost of the oil feedstock, which accounted for 88% of total estimated production costs. An analysis of the dependence of production costs on the cost of the feedstock indicated a direct linear relationship between the two, with a change of US$0.020/1 ($0.075/gal) in product cost per US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) change in oil cost. Process economics included the recovery of coproduct glycerol generated during biodiesel production, and its sale into the commercial glycerol market as an 80% w/w aqueous solution, which reduced production costs by approximate to 6%. The production cost of biodiesel was found to vary inversely and linearly with variations in the market value of glycerol, increasing by US$0.0022/1 ($0.0085/gal) for every US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) reduction in glycerol value. The model is flexible in that it can be modified to calculate the effects on capital and production costs of changes in feedstock cost, changes in the type of feedstock employed, changes in the value of the glycerol coproduct, and change in process chemistry and technology.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Corn Stover to Sustain Soil Organic Carbon Further Constrains Biomass Supply,Agronomy Journal,0002-1962,"Wilhelm, WW; Johnson, JME; Karlen, DL; Lightle, DT",10.2134/agronj2OO7.0150,7-Nov,US Department of Agriculture,,"Sustainable aboveground crop biomass harvest estimates for cellulosic ethanol production, to date, have been limited by the need for residue to control erosion.

Over large areas of the state dry deposition is of greater magnitude than wet deposition due to the arid climate. However, fog deposition can also be significant in areas where seasonal fogs and N pollution sources coincide. The dominance of dry deposition is magnified in airsheds with frequent temperature inversions such as occur in the Los Angeles Air Basin. Most of the deposition in such areas occurs in summer as a result of surface deposition of nitric acid vapor (HNO3) as well as particulate nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+). Internal uptake of gaseous N pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), HNO3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), ammonia (NH3), and others provides additional N to forests. However, summer drought and subsequent lower stomatal conductance of plants tend to limit plant utilization of gaseous N Nitrogen deposition is much greater than S deposition in California. In locations close to photochemical smog source areas, concentrations of oxidized forms of N (NO2, HNO3, PAN) dominate, while in areas near agricultural activities the importance of reduced N forms (NH3, NH4+) significantly increases. Little data from California forests are available for most of the gaseous N pollutants. Total inorganic N deposition in the most highly-exposed forests in the Los Angeles Air Basin may be as high as 25-45 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Nitrogen deposition in these highly-exposed areas has led to N saturation of chaparral and mixed conifer stands. In N saturated forests high concentrations of NO3- are found in streamwater, soil solution, and in foliage. Nitric oxide emissions from soil and foliar N:P ratios are also high in N saturated sites.

The Upper Mississippi basin drains 491,700 km(2) in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin and outlets in the Mississippi River north of Cairo, Illinois. The first method uses the water balance components from the soil and water assessment tool model (SWAT). The model was used to simulate the daily water balance of approximately 16 soil/land use hydrologic response units (HRU) within each of the 131 USGS 8-digit watersheds. The water balance of each HRU is simulated with four storages: snow, soil (up to ten layers), shallow aquifer, and deep aquifer, Groundwater recharge is defined as water that percolates past the bottom soil layer into the shallow aquifer. Recharge is lagged to become base flow and can also be lost to ET. The second method consists of two procedures to estimate base flow and recharge from daily stream flow: (1) a digital recursive filter to separate base flow from daily flow and (2) a modified hydrograph recession curve displacement technique to estimate groundwater recharge. These procedures were applied to 283 USGS stations ranging in area from 50 to 1200 km(2). A smoothed surface was obtained using a thin plate spline technique and estimates were averaged for each 8-digit basin, Simulated flow was calibrated against average annual flow for each 8-digit.

In each experiment, SOA was collected and analyzed for potential tracer compounds, whose concentrations were used to calculate a mass fraction of tracer compounds for each hydrocarbon. In the field, 33 PM2.5 samples were collected and analyzed for (1) tracer compounds observed in the laboratory irradiations, (2) levoglucosan, a biomass burning tracer, and (3) total OC.

The estimates show SOA formation from isoprene, a-pinene, beta-caryophyllene, and toluene contributed significantly to the ambient OC concentrations. The relative contributions were highly seasonal with biomass burning in the winter accounting for more than 50% of the OC concentrations, while SOA contributions remained low. However, during the 6-month period between May and October, SOA from the precursor hydrocarbons contributed more than 40% of the measured OC concentration.

To address this issue, an isoprene/NO(X)/air mixture was irradiated in a flow reactor smog chamber in both the absence and presence of SO(2) to measure the SOA yield of isoprene and to establish whether the two 2-methyl tetrols and 2-methylglyceric acid are present in isoprene SOA and could serve as SOA indicator compounds. In the absence of SO(2), the SOA yield of 0.002 was low, as expected, although uncertain because the SOA concentration was near chamber background levels. However, in the presence of SO(2), the SOA yield increased significantly to 0.028. Analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the SOA samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed chamber concentrations of the two 2-methyl tetrols totaling 0.1 mu g m(-3) and a 2-methylglyceric acid concentration of 0.4 mu g m(-3) in the. absence of SO(2), with the levels increasing significantly to 6.3 mu g m(-3) and 1.2 mu g m(-3), respectively, when SO(2) was added. The laboratory data suggest that these compounds are possible indicator compounds for isoprene SOA and that the presence of SO(2) enhances significantly SOA formation from isoprene photooxidation, with acid-catalyzed reactions possibly playing a major role. The importance of these findings was supported by the detection of the two 2-methyl tetrols and 2-methylglyceric acid in summertime ambient PM2.5 samples collected at three locations in the eastern United States. However, additional mechanistic studies are required to predict the contributions of the SO(2)-assisted isoprene SOA formation to ambient PM(2.5) concentrations.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Primary and secondary contributions to ambient PM in the midwestern United States,Environmental Science and Technology,0013-936X,"Lewandowski, M; Jaoui, M; Offenberg, JH; Kleindienst, TE; Edney, EO; Sheesley, RJ; Schauer, JJ",10.1021/es0720412,1-May-08,US Environmental Protection Agency; Alion Science and Technology; University of Wisconsin-Madison,US Environmental Protection Agency; Alion Science and Technology,,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,"Survey of volatile organic compounds associated with automotive emissions in the urban airshed Sao Paulo, Brazil",Atmospheric Environment,1352-2310,"Colon, M; Pleil, JD; Hartlage, TA; Guardani, ML; Martins, MH",10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00178-9,1-Aug,"US Environmental Protection Agency; Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambienta, Sao Paulo, Brazil",US Environmental Protection Agency,"The Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), Brazil, is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world (population 17 million, approx.) and relies heavily on alcohol-based fuels for automobiles. It is estimated that about 40% of the total volume of fuel is ethanol with some vehicles using pure ethanol and others a gasoline/ethanol blend. As such, Sao Paulo is an excellent example of an oxygenates-dominated airshed of mobile sources and is most likely indicative of the future in heavily populated areas in the US such as Los Angeles where ""oxy-fuels"" are becoming an important replacement for the conventional pure petroleum-based fuels. In this work, we surveyed the ambient air to identify and quantify the organic compounds associated with the evaporative and exhaust emissions of these fuels and to begin to understand the potential for human exposure. Because this was an initial test without detailed prior knowledge of the airshed of the area, we applied two different air sampling methods for various time periods to assess the ambient concentrations of a variety of polar and nonpolar volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For quality assurance (QA), we collected all the samples in duplicate (whole-air samples in Summa canisters and adsorbent-based samples on Perkin-Elmer Air Toxics tubes) at various flow rates to test performance. All samples were collected over identical time frames, typically for 1-, 2-, and 4-h periods per day at six different locations over a period of I week. Overall Sao Paulo results demonstrate that mean concentrations of single-ring aromatics are 2-3 times higher, volatile aldehydes are 5-10 times higher, and simple alcohols 10-100 times higher as compared to results of a recent study performed by EPA in the Los Angeles basin.

Oxidation products in the filter extracts were treated using O-(2,3,4,5,6,-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine (PFBHA) to derivatize carbonyl groups followed by treatment with N, O-Bis( trimethylsilyl)-acetamide (BSTFA) to derivatize OH groups. The derivatized products were detected with a positive chemical ionization (CI) gas chromatography ion trap mass spectroscopy (GC-ITMS) system. The results of the GC-ITMS analyses were consistent with the previous studies that demonstrated the formation of multi-functional oxygenates. Denuder results showed that many of these same compounds were present in the gas, as well as, the particle phase. Moreover, evidence was found for a series of multifunctional acids produced as higher order oxidation products of the toluene/NOx system. Products having nearly the same mass spectrum were also found in the ambient environment using identical analytical techniques.

By use of pulmonary function models and blood gas equations, equivalent HbCO values were calculated for data in the literature on hypoxic hypoxia and behavior. Another meta analysis was performed to fit a dose-effects function to the equivalent HbCO data and to correct for the behavioral effects of hypocapnia (which usually occurs during hypoxic hypoxia but not with HbCO elevation).

While pulmonary function decrements occur almost immediately after ozone exposure, it is not known how quickly the cellular and biochemical changes indicative of inflammation occur in humans. Changes in neutrophils and PGE2 have been observed in humans as early as 3 hr (28) and as late as 18 hr post exposure (19). The purpose of this study was to determine whether inflammatory changes occur relatively rapidly (within 1 hr) following exposure to ozone, or if the cascade of events which are initiated by ozone and lead to inflammation, take some time to develop. We exposed 10 healthy volunteers twice: once to filtered air and once to 0.4 ppm ozone. Each exposure lasted for 2 hr at an exercise level of 60 L/min, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 1 hr following exposure. The data from this study were compared to those from a previous study in which 10 subjects were exposed to O3 under identical conditions except that bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 18 hr following exposure. The results of the present study demonstrate that O3 is capable of inducing rapid cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. These changes were detectable as early as 1 hr following a 2 hr exposure of humans to ozone. The profiles of these changes were different at 1 hr and 18 hr following ozone exposures. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had levels of neutrophils, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 that were higher at 1 hr than at 18 hr post exposure. On the other hand, the levels of fibronectin and plasminogen activator were found to be higher at 18 hr than at 1 hr after ozone exposure. A temporal association appeared to exist between changes occurring in the biochemical markers and alterations in lung function. Further studies may be useful in determining if a causal relationship exists between these parameters.",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Exposure of humans to ambient levels of ozone for 6.6 hours causes cellular and biochemical changes in the lung,American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology,1044-1549,"Devlin, RB; McDonnell, WF; Mann, R; Becker, S; House, DE; Schreinemachers, D; Koren, HS",,Jan-91,"US Environmental Protection Agency; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; ABB Environmental Services, Inc;",,"An acute (2 h) exposure of humans to 0.4 ppm ozone initiates biochemical changes in the lung that result in the production of components mediating inflammation and acute lung damage as well as components having the potential to lead to long-term effects such as fibrosis.

Therefore, it is important to determine if a prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone is also capable of causing cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. Nonsmoking males were randomly exposed to filtered air and either 0.10 ppm ozone or 0.08 ppm ozone for 6.6 h with moderate exercise (40 liters/min). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after each exposure, and cells and fluid were analyzed. The BAL fluid of volunteers exposed to 0.10 ppm ozone had significant increases in neutrophils (PMNs), protein, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with BAL fluid from the same volunteers exposed to filtered air. In addition, there was a decrease in the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytize yeast via the complement receptor. Exposure to 0.08 ppm ozone resulted in significant increases in PMNs, PGE2, LDH, IL-6, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and decreased phagocytosis via the complement receptor.

Our model simulations indicate that agricultural sources in the watersheds contribute more than 70% of the delivered N and P. However, corn and soybean cultivation is the largest contributor of N (52%), followed by atmospheric deposition sources (16%); whereas P originates primarily from animal manure on pasture and rangelands (37%), followed by corn and soybeans (25%), other crops (18%), and urban sources (12%). The traction of in-stream P and N load delivered to the Gulf increases with stream size, but reservoir trapping of P causes large local- and regional-scale differences in delivery. Our results indicate the diversity of management approaches required to achieve efficient control of nutrient loads to the Gulf.

Subsequently, an attempt is made to determine to what extent these impacts are a bottleneck for a sustainable and certified ethanol production. Seventeen environmental and socioeconomic areas of concern are analysed. Four parameters are used to evaluate if an area of concern is a bottleneck: (1) the importance of the area of concern, based on the severity of the impact and the frequency of which an aspect is mentioned in the literature as an area of concern, (2) the availability of indicators and criteria, (3) the, necessity of improvement. strategies to reach compliance with Brazilian and/or (inter) national legislation, standards, guidelines and sustainability criteria, and (4) the impact of these improvement strategies on the costs and potential of ethanol production. Fourteen areas of concern are classified as a minor or medium bottleneck. For 7 areas of concern the additional costs to avoid or reduce undesirable effects have been calculated at <=+10% for each area of concern. Due to higher yields and overlapping costs the total additional production costs of compliance with various environmental and socio-economic criteria are about +36%. This study also shows that the energy input to output ratio can be increased and the greenhouse gas emissions reduced by increasing the ethanol production per tonne cane and by increasing the use of sugarcane waste for electricity production. A major bottleneck for a sustainable and certified production is the increase in cane production and the possible impacts on biodiversity and the competition with food production. Genetically modified cane is presently being developed, but is at this moment not (yet) applied. Both a ban on and the allowance of the use of genetically modified cane could become a major bottleneck considering the potentially large benefits and disadvantages, that are both highly uncertain at this moment. The approach demonstrated in this report provides a useful framework for the development of a practically applicable certification system, but further monitoring and research is required to reduce gaps in knowledge in combination with stakeholder consultation (particularly with respect to the three bottlenecks identified in this article).",Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,"Absorption of air pollution by plants, and consequences for growth",Trends in Ecology and Evolution,0169-5347,"Winner, WE; Atkinson, CJ",10.1016/0169-5347(86)90061-3,Jul-86,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,,,Scholarly Journal2060-AO81,,32,Analysis of Traffic Patterns and Yield Monitor Data for Field Efficiency Determination,Applied Engineering in Agriculture,0883-8542,"Grisso, RD; Jasa, PJ; Rolofson, DE",,2-Mar,"Virginia Tech; University of Nebraska; Agri-Cross Farms, Inc.",,"Field efficiency is an important criterion for determining the expected field capacity and, indirectly, for making important machinery management decisions.

The vehicles were tested on diesel and biodiesel using the West Virginia University WVU 5 peak cycle, which has prescribed accelerations, cruise sections, and decelerations and covers a 5 mile (8 km) distance. Also, a test cycle that was similar but employed maximum acceleration rates under the control of the driver was used: this was termed the ""WVU 5 mile route"". Emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) were substantially higher for the WVU 5 mile route than for the WVU 5 peak cycle, which cart be explained in terms of air:fuel ratio. Emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were less affected The WVU 5 mile route may be favored in the future in that it examines full load emissions. To compare emissions between vehicles fueled with No. 2 diesel (D2) and a blend of 65% D2 with 35% soy biodiesel (BD35), eight class 8 tractors were operated through the WW 5 peak cycle.

Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality. Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP36,,14,Reduction in Fine Particulate Air Pollution and Mortality,"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 173: 667-672.",1073-449X,"Laden, F.; Schwartz, J.; Speizer, F.E.; Dockery, D.W.",10.1164/rccm.200503-443OC,2006,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"Rationale: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear. Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations. Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors. Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95). Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP36,,14,"Expert Judgment Assessment of the Mortality Impact of Changes in Ambient Fine Particulate Matter in the U.S. ","Environ.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP36,,14,Tax Incidence ,"Handbook of Public Economics, Vol. 4",,"Fullerton, D; Metcalf, G",,2002,University of Texas; Tufts University,,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AP36 ,,14,"2002 and 1997 Benchmark Input-Output Accounts: Detailed Make Table, Use Table and Direct Requirements Table.

During Phase I, lasting from 1995 through 1999, electric generating units larger than 100 MWe in generating capacity with an annual average emission rate in 1985 greater than 2.5 pounds of SO2 per million Btu of heat input in 1985 (hereafter, #SO2/mmBtu) were required to reduce emissions to a level that would be, on average, no greater than 2.5 #SO2/mmBtu. In Phase II, beginning in 2000 and continuing indefinitely, the program was expanded to include fossil-fuel electricity generating units greater than 25 MWe, or virtually all fossil-fuel power plants in the United States. Emissions from these affected units are limited, after accounting for any allowances banked from Phase I, to an annual cap of 8.9 million tons, or about half of total electric utility SO2 emissions in the early 1980s. The Phase II cap is equivalent to an Ex Post Evaluation: US SO2 Program 2 average emission rate of 1.2 #SO2/mmBtu, when divided by the mid-1980s level of heat input at fossil-fuel burning power plants.",Other,"Working Paper,m Available at http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44996"2060-AP50,,3,"Global Insight U.S. State, Metropolitan Area, and County-level Forecasting Services ",,,,,2007,,,,Other,Available at http://www.globalinsight.com/ProductsServices/ProductDetail1100.htm2060-AP50,,3,GTAP Energy in GAMS: The Dataset and Static Model,,,"Rutherford, TF; Paltsev, SV",,2000,,,,Other,"Working Paper, Available at http://www.mpsge.org/mainpage/mpsge.htm"2060-AP50,,3,Input Output and General Equilibrium Estimates of Embodied CO2: A Data Set and Static Framework for Assessment,,,"Babiker, MH; Rutherford, TF",,1997,,,,Other,University of Colorado Working Paper 97-2. 2060-AP50,,3,"Pfiesteria’s economic impact on seafood industry sales and recreational fishing, p. 35–38","In B.

However, linkages between growth and ambient ozone concentrations in the field are not well established for forest trees. Ambient ozone concentrations have been shown to cause foliar injury on a number of tree species throughout much of the eastern USA. Symptom expression is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors and, therefore, ozone-exposure/tree-response relationships have been difficult to confirm. Clearly defined, cause-effect relationships between visible injury and growth losses due to ozone have not been validated. Generalizations of sensitivity of forest trees to ozone are complicated by tree development stage, microclimate, leaf phenology, compensatory processes, within-species variation and other interacting stresses. In general, decreases in above-ground growth at ambient ozone levels in the eastern USA appear to be in the range of 0-10% per year. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of tree species, with the vast majority of studies involving individual tree seedlings in a non-competitive environment. Comparative studies of small and large trees indicate that seedlings are not suitable surrogates for predicting responses of mature trees to ozone. Process-level modelling is a promising methodology that has been recently utilized to assess ozone effects on a stand to regional scale, indicating that ozone is affecting forest growth in the eastern USA. The extent and magnitude of the response is variable and depends on many edaphic and climatic factors. It is imperative when conducting assessment exercises, however, that forest biologists constantly keep in mind the tremendous variability that exists within natural systems. Scaling of single site/physiological response phenomena from an individual tree to an ecosystem and/or region necessitates further research. ",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP50,,3,Deterministic versus stochastic evaluation of the aggregate economic effects of price support programs,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,"Taylor, CR",,1994,Auburn University,US Department of Agriculture,"Economic effects of agricultural policies estimated with deterministic models may be biased because certainty equivalent requirements are not satisfied in the agricultural sector. This article compares numerically estimated expected values of key aggregate economic variables for two levels of target prices (i. e. supported price level) from deterministic and stochastic formulations of AGSIM, which is a large-scale econometric simulation model of crop and livestock production in the United States.For nominal target prices set by the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Bill (FACT), the deterministic formulation underestimated the level of deficiency payments (the difference between target price and market price) by a cumulative total of $800 million (6.2%) over the 5 year life of the Bill compared to estimates from the stochastic model. For target prices 10% below the FACT levels, the deterministic model underestimated deficiency payments by $1220 million (36.8%). Much of the economic impact estimation bias can be attributed to price received by participating producers under FACT having a probability distribution truncated at the target price, which is a strong departure from the certainty equivalent requirements needed to have mean outcomes from stochastic models equal outcomes from their deterministic counterpart.Estimated changes in deficiency payments from lowering target prices by 10% were overestimated by $420 million (4.3%) with the deterministic model, which suggests that deterministic models are less biased for estimating the change in deficiency payments than in estimating the level of payments.The bias associated with mean values of other variables, such as crop prices and farm income, was much less in percentage terms than bias in estimates of deficiency payments.

To enhance our understanding of the fall tourism market, this article presents insights gained from a telephone survey of households in the Great Lakes region. Fall tourists, compared to their summer counterparts, were found to be older, less likely to travel with children, and less active in recreation. Fall color viewing rarely motivated trips and was much more prevalent as an ancillary activity. Distinct types of fall tourists were identified based on patterns of participation in trip activities and whether trips began during the early, middle, or late fall. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Associations with specific cardiopulmonary diseases might be useful in exploring potential mechanistic pathways linking exposure and mortality.Methods and Results - General pathophysiological pathways linking long-term PM exposure with mortality and expected patterns of PM mortality with specific causes of death were proposed a priori. Vital status, risk factor, and cause-of-death data, collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, were linked with air pollution data from United States metropolitan areas. Cox Proportional Hazard regression models were used to estimate PM-mortality associations with specific causes of death. Long-term PM exposures were most strongly associated with mortality attributable to ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. For these cardiovascular causes of death, a 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine PM was associated with 8% to 18% increases in mortality risk, with comparable or larger risks being observed for smokers relative to nonsmokers. Mortality attributable to respiratory disease had relatively weak associations.Conclusions - Fine particulate air pollution is a risk factor for cause-specific cardiovascular disease mortality via mechanisms that likely include pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and altered cardiac autonomic function. Although smoking is a much larger risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, exposure to fine PM imposes additional effects that seem to be at least additive to if not synergistic with smoking.

Exposure to various environmental factors, including air pollutants and allergens, has been suggested as a partial explanation of these trends. To examine relations between several air pollutants and asthma exacerbation in African Americans, we recruited a panel of 138 children in central Los Angeles. We recorded daily data on respiratory symptoms and medication use for 13 weeks and examined these data in conjunction with data on ozone (O-3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), meteorological variables, pollens, and molds. Using generalized estimating equations, we found associations between respiratory symptom occurrence and several environmental factors. For example, new episodes of cough were associated with exposure to PM10 (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.39; interquartile range [IQR] = 17 mug/m(3), 24-hour average), PM2.5 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03-1.18; IQR = 30 mug/m(3), 12-hour average), NO2, and the molds Cladosporium and Alternaria, but not with exposure to O-3 or pollen.

The high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in fish has been suggested to be a protective factor. In addition, fish is the entirely dominating source of methylmercury for the general population, and the concentration of Hg in erythrocytes (Ery-Hg) is often used as an index of fish consumption. Our aim was to study the relationships between a first-ever myocardial infarction, Ery-Hg, activity of gluthathione peroxidase in erythrocytes (Ery-GSH-Px) and plasma concentration of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (P-PUFA). In a population-based prospective nested case-control study within Northern Sweden seventy-eight cases of a first-ever myocardial infarction were compared with 156 controls with respect to Ery-Hg, P-PUFA and Ery-GSH-Px. Both Ery-Hg and P-PUFA, but not Ery-GSH-Px, were significantly (P<0.0001) higher in subjects reporting high fish intake (at least one meal per week) than in those with lower intake. This finding suggests that Ery-Hg and P-PUFA reflect previous long-term fish intake. Low risk of myocardial infarction was associated with high Ery-Hg or high P-PUFA. In a multivariate model the risk of myocardial infarction was further reduced in subjects with both high Ery-Hg and high P-PUFA (odds ratio 0.16, 95 % CI 0.04, 0.65).

This paper uses an areal measure of traffic density as a surrogate index of exposure to vehicular traffic. We present associations between county-level traffic density (annual vehicle-km traveled km(-2)), ambient air quality, and mortality in a cohort of about 70,000 male US veterans (the Washington University-EPRI Veterans Cohort) who were enrolled in 1976 and followed through 2001. Traffic density is seen to be a significant and robust predictor of survival in this cohort, more so than ambient air quality, with the possible exception of ozone. Stronger effects of traffic density are seen in the counties that have ambient air quality monitoring data, which also tend to have higher levels of traffic density. These proportional-hazard modeling results indicate only modest changes in traffic-related mortality risks over time, from 1976-2001, despite the decline in regulated tailpipe emissions per vehicle since the mid-1970s. This suggests that other environmental effects may be involved, such as particles from brake, tire, and road wear, traffic noise, psychological stress, and spatial gradients in socioeconomic status.

We obtained data on 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. Visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, and pneumonia were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized estimating equations.Results: In single-pollutant models examining 3-day moving averages of pollutants (lags 0, 1, and 2): standard deviation increases of ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with 1-3% increases in UR1 visits; a 2 mug/m(3) increase of PM2.5 organic carbon was associated with a 3% increase in pneumonia visits; and standard deviation increases of NO2 and CO were associated with 2-3% increases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits. Positive associations persisted beyond 3 days for several of the outcomes, and over a week for asthma.Conclusions: The results of this study contribute to the evidence of an association of several correlated gaseous and particulate pollutants, including ozone, NO2, CO, PM, and organic carbon, with specific respiratory conditions.

This national cohort is male with an average age at recruitment of 51 +/- 72 yr; 35% were black and 81% had been smokers at one time. Because the subjects have been receiving care at various U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals, access to and quality of medical care are relatively homogeneous. The health endpoints available for analysis include all-cause mortality and specific diagnoses for morbidity during VA hospitalizations; only the mortality results are discussed here. Nonpollution predictor variables in the baseline model include race, smoking (ever or at recruitment), age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and body mass index (BMI). Interactions of BP and BMI with age were also considered. Although this study essentially controls for socioeconomic status by design because of the homogeneity of the cohort, selected ecological variables were also considered at the ZIP code and county levels, some of which were round to be significant predictors. Pollutants were averaged by year and county for TSP, PM10, CO, O-3 and NO2; SO2 and Pb were considered less thoroughly. Both mean and peak levels were considered for gases. SO42- data from the AIRS database and PM2.5, coarse particles, PM15, and SO42- from the U.S. EPA Inhalable Particulate (IP) Network were also considered. Four relevant exposure periods were defined: 1974 and earlier (back to 1953 for TSP), 1975-1981, 1982-1988, and 1989-1996. Deaths during each of the three most recent exposure periods were considered separately, yielding up to 12 combinations of exposure and mortality periods for each pollutant. Associations between concurrent air quality and mortality periods were considered to relate to acute responses; delayed associations with prior exposures were considered to be emblematic of initiation of chronic disease. Preexposure mortality associations were considered to be indirect (noncausal). The implied mortality risks of long-term exposure to air pollution were found to be sensitive to the details of the regression model, the time period of exposure, the locations included, and the inclusion of ecological as well as personal variables. Both positive and negative statistically significant mortality responses were found. Fine particles as measured in the 1979-1984 US. EPA Inhalable Particulate Network indicated no significant (positive) excess mortality risk for this cohort in any of the models considered. Among the positive responses, indications of concurrent mortality risks were seen for NO2 and peak O-3, with a similar indication of delayed risks only for NO2. The mean levels of these excess risks were in the range of 5-9%. Peak O-3 was dominant in two-pollutant models and there was some indication of a threshold in response. However, it is likely that standard errors of the regression coefficients may have been underestimated because of spatial autocorrelation among the model residuals. The significant variability of responses by period of death cohort suggests that aggregation over the entire period of followup obscures important aspects of the implied pollution-mortality relationships, such as early depletion of the available pool of those subjects who may be most susceptible to air pollution effects.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP50,,3,"Air Pollution, Blood Pressure, and Their Long-Term Associations with Mortality",Inhalation Toxicology,0895-8378,"Lipfert, FW; Perry, HM; Miller, JP; Baty, JD; Wyzga, RE; Carmody, SE",10.1080/08958370390196435,15-Apr-00,Environmental Consultant; Washington University School of Medicine; Electric Power Research Institute; Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center,Electric Power Research Institute,"This article addresses the importance of blood pressure as a covariate in studies of long-term associations between air quality and mortality.

The relationship between BP and air quality is considered by reviewing the literature, by deleting variables from the proportional hazards regression model, and by stratifying the cohort by diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level. The literature review shows BP to be an important predictor of survival and finds small transient associations between air quality and BP that may be either positive or negative. The regression model sensitivity runs showed that the associations with air pollution are robust to the deletion of the BP variables, for the entire cohort.

In boys, heart rate variability decreased with increasing mercury exposures, particularly from 1 to 10 mu g/liter cord blood, at which the variability was reduced by 47%, (95% CL = 14%, 68%).

Results suggest that climate change driven air quality-related health effects will be adversely affected in more than 2/3 of the continental U.S. Changes in health effects induced by PM(2.5) dominate compared to those caused by ozone, PM(2.5)-induced premature mortality is about 15 times higher than that due to ozone, Nationally the analysis suggests approximately 4000 additional annual premature deaths due to climate change impacts on PM(2.5) vs 300 due to climate change-induced ozone changes. However, the impacts vary spatially. Increased premature mortality due to elevated ozone concentrations will be offset by lower mortality from reductions in PM(2.5) in 11 states.

Between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1997, occurrences of asthma as a primary diagnosis were identified at 27 hospitals' emergency departments within Premier's Perspective Comparative Database. Patients visiting the ED could either be treated and released or admitted to the hospital.

For the 2,149 patients who visited the ED only, the average visit cost was $234.48. For hospitalized patients, the average length of stay was 3.8 d, and the cost was $3,102.53. Nursing care was the source of the majority of hospital costs for asthma (43.6%), respiratory therapy (13.6%), and medications (10.4%). For adult asthma patients requiring hospitalization, the total cost is high and resources consumed are unavoidable. Thus, a continuum of care aimed at appropriate asthma management, especially in the elderly, could result in substantial cost savings over those aimed at reducing inpatient utilization of care.

MacArthur Foundation,"Several studies in recent years have suggested that exposure to airborne particles and to ozone are associated with increases in respiratory hospital admissions. Few of those studies have used inhalable particles as their measure of exposure, and the studies did not always examine both particle and ozone exposure. This study examined the association between both PM(10) and ozone and respiratory hospital admissions for persons 65 yr of age and older in the Detroit, Michigan, metropolitan area during the years 1986 to 1989. After controlling for seasonal and other long-term temporal trends, temperature, and dew point temperature, both PM(10) (RR = 1.012, 95% Cl = 1.019-1.004) and 24-h ozone concentrations (RR = 1.026, 95% Cl = 1.040-1.013) were associated with daily admissions for pneumonia. The relative risks are for a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10) and a 5-ppb increase in 24-h ozone concentration and from models including both pollutants. Admissions for COPD other than asthma were associated with PM(10) (RR = 1.020, 95% Cl = 1.032-1.009) and ozone (RR = 1.028, 95% Cl = 1.049-1.007) as well. Asthma admissions were not associated with either pollutant. Controlling for one pollutant did not effect the magnitude of the association with the other pollutant. The magnitude of these relative risks are very similar to those recently reported in Birmingham, Alabama, Ontario, and New York State. This suggests that the associations with both pollutants are likely to be causal.

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of more than 1 million deaths in 14 U.S. cities. Main results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10-ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% Cl 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months. Conclusions: The association between ozone and mortality risk is unlikely to be caused by confounding by temperature.

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers.Methods: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances.Results: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-mu g/m(3) increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5.Conclusions: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be antici-pated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses.

PM(10) has rarely been used as the particle exposure measure, however. This study examined whether such an association could be seen in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, which has daily monitoring data for PM(10). Data on hospital admissions in persons aged 65 y and older were obtained from Medicare records for the years 1986 through 1989. Daily counts of admissions, by admit date, were computed for pneumonia (ICD9 480-487) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD9 490-496). Classification was by discharge diagnosis. Daily air pollution data from all monitoring stations for ozone and PM(10) in Minneapolis-St. Paul were obtained, and the daily average for each pollutant was computed. An average of approximately six pneumonia admissions and two admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurred each day. Poisson regression analysis was used to control for time trends, seasonal fluctuations, and weather. PM(10) was a risk factor for pneumonia admissions (relative risk [RR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-1.02) and COPD admissions (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 2.06-1.20). Ozone was also associated with pneumonia admissions (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.36-0.97). The relative risks are for an increase of 100 mu g/m(3) in daily PM(10) and 50 ppb in daily ozone concentration. Several alternative methods for controlling for seasonal patterns and weather were used, including nonparametric regression techniques. The results were not sensitive to the methods. When days exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for either pollutant were excluded, the association remained for both pneumonia (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.34-1.03 for PM(10), and RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.41-0.99 for ozone) and COPD (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 2.06-1.16 for PM(10)).

This relationship was examined in two cities with substantially different levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) but similar levels of airborne particles in an attempt to separate the effects of the two pollutants. Significant differences in weather between the two cities allowed the evaluation of that potential confounder also.Methods - Daily counts of admissions to all hospitals for respiratory disease (ICD 9 460-519) were constructed for persons aged 65 years and older in two cities - New Haven, Connecticut and Tacoma, Washington. Each city was analysed separately. Average daily concentrations of SO2, inhalable particles (PM(10)), and ozone were computed from all monitors in each city, and daily average temperature and humidity were obtained from the US weather service. Daily respiratory admission counts were regressed on temperature, humidity, day of the week indicators, and air pollution. A 19 day weighted moving regression filter was used to remove all seasonal and subseasonal patterns from the data. Possible U-shaped dependence of admissions on temperature was dealt with using indicator variables for eight categories each of temperature and humidity. Each pollutant was first examined individually and then multiple pollutant models were fitted.Results - All three pollutants were associated with respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The PM(10) associations were little changed by control for either ozone or SO2. The ozone association was likewise independent of the other pollutants. The SO2 association was substantially attenuated by control for ozone in both cities, and by control for PM(10) in Tacoma. The magnitude of the effect was small (relative risk 1.06 in New Haven and 1.10 in Tacoma for a 50 mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10), for example) but, given the ubiquitous exposure, this has some public health significance.Conclusions - Air pollution concentrations within current guidelines were associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The strongest evidence for an independent association was for PM(10), followed by ozone. These results are consistent with other studies and suggest that lowering air pollution concentrations would have some impact on public health.

The present study evaluates effects of particulate air pollution on mortality using data from a large cohort drawn from many study areas. We linked ambient air pollution data from 151 U.S. metropolitan areas in 1980 with individual risk factor on 552,138 adults who resided in these areas when enrolled in a prospective study in 1982. Deaths were ascertained through December, 1989. Exposure to sulfate and fine particulate air pollution, which is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, was estimated from national data bases. The relationships of air pollution to all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality was examined using multivariate analysis which controlled for smoking, education, and other risk factors. Although small compared with cigarette smoking, an association between mortality and particulate air pollution was observed. Adjusted relative risk ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of all-cause mortality for the most polluted areas compared with the least polluted equaled 1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) and 1.17 (1.09 to 1.26) when using sulfate and fine particulate measures respectively. Particulate air pollution was associated with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality but not with mortality due to other causes. Increased mortality is associated with sulfate and fine particulate air pollution at levels commonly found in U.S. cities. The increase in risk is not attributable to tobacco smoking, although other unmeasured correlates of pollution cannot be excluded with certainty.

Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks.Methods. In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities.Results. Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates.Conclusions. Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.

Recent attention has focused on the effects of particulate exposure on cardiac autonomic control. Inhaled particulates may affect the autonomic nervous system either directly, by eliciting a sympathetic stress response, or indirectly, through inflammatory cytokines produced in the lungs and released into the, circulation.Methods and Results-This longitudinal study examined the association of particulates less than or equal to2.5 mum in diameter (PM2.5) with heart rate variability (HRV) in an occupational cohort (N = 40). Continuous monitoring of exposure and HR was performed during and away from work. PM2.5 levels were higher than ambient levels typically reported in Boston, 0.167 +/- 3.205 mg/m(3) (geometric mean geometric SD). We found a 2.66% decrease (95% CI, -3.75% to -1.58%) in the 5-minute SD of normal RR intervals (SDNN) for every 1 mg/m(3) increase in the 4-hour moving PM2.5 average and a 1.02% increase (95% CI, 0.59% to 1.46%) in HR after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The decrease in SDNN became larger as the averaging interval increased.Conclusions-Workers experienced altered cardiac autonomic control after exposure to occupational and environmental PM2.5. There appears to be either a long-acting (several hours) and a short-acting (several minutes) component to the mechanism of action that may be related to the production of cytokines and the sympathetic stress response, respectively, or a cumulative effect that begins shortly after exposure begins. The clinical significance of these effects in a healthy working population is unclear.

Whether high concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains unknown.Methods and Results - We interviewed 772 patients with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle mass (2.5 mum (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period. In addition, a delayed response associated with 24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of 1.48 associated with an increase of 25 mug/m(3) PM2.5 during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio of 1.69 for an increase of 20 mug/m(3) PM2.5 in the 24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95% CIs 1.09, 2.02 and 1.13, 2.34, respectively).Conclusions - The present study suggests that elevated concentrations of fine particles in the air may transiently elevate the risk of MIs within a few hours and 1 day after exposure. Further studies in other locations are needed to clarify the importance of this potentially preventable trigger of MI.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.

In the second stage, we specify a class of distributions for the true city-specific relative rates to estimate an overall effect by taking into account the variability within and across cities. We perform the calculations with respect to several random effects distributions (normal, t-student, and mixture of normal), thus relaxing the common assumption of a two-stage normal-normal hierarchical model. We assess the sensitivity of the results to: (i) lag structure for ozone exposure; (ii) degree of adjustment for long-term trends; (iii) inclusion of other pollutants in the model; (iv) heat waves; (v) random effects distributions; and (vi) prior hyperparameters.On average across cities, we found that a 10ppb increase in summer ozone level over the previous week is associated with a 1.25 per cent increase in CVDRESP mortality (95 per cent posterior regions: 0.47, 2.03). The relative rate estimates are also positive and statistically significant at lags 0, 1 and 2. We found that associations between summer ozone and CVDRESP mortality are sensitive to the confounding adjustment for PM10, but are robust to: (i) the adjustment for long-term trends, other gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 and CO); (ii) the distributional assumptions at the second stage of the hierarchical model; and (iii) the prior distributions on all unknown parameters.Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models and their application to the NMMAPS data allow us to estimate of an acute health effect associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in the last few days on average across several locations. The application of these methods and the systematic assessment of the sensitivity of findings to model assumptions provide important epidemiological evidence for future air quality regulations.

We report the results of 122 bioassays in 13 streams of the three study regions: the Adirondack mountains of New York, the Catskill mountains of New York, and the Northern Appalachian Plateau of Pennsylvania. Bioassays during acidic episodes had significantly higher mortality than did bioassays conducted under nonacidic conditions, but there was little difference in mortality rates in bioassays experiencing acidic episodes and those experiencing acidic conditions throughout the test period. Multiple logistic regression models were used to relate bioassay mortality rates to summary statistics of time-varying stream chemistry (inorganic monomeric aluminum, calcium, pH, and dissolved organic carbon) estimated for the 20-d bioassay periods. The large suite of candidate regressors also included biological, regional, and seasonal factors, as well as several statistics summarizing various features of aluminum exposure duration and magnitude. Regressor variable selection and model assessment were complicated by multicollinearity and overdispersion. For the target fish species, brook trout, bioassay mortality was most closely related to time-weighted median inorganic aluminum. Median Ca and minimum pH offered additional explanatory power, as did stream-specific aluminum responses. Due to high multicollinearity, the relative importance of different aluminum exposure duration and magnitude variables was difficult to assess, but these variables taken together added no significant explanatory power to models already containing median aluminum. Between 59 and 79% of the variation in brook trout mortality was explained by models employing between one and five regressors. Simpler models were developed for smaller sets of bioassays that tested slimy and mottled sculpin (Cottus cognatus and C. bairdi) as well as blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus). For these forage species a single inorganic aluminum exposure variable successfully accounted for 86-98% of the observed mortality. Even though field bioassays showed evidence of multiple toxicity factors, model results suggest that adequate mortality predictions can be obtained from a single index of inorganic Al concentrations during exposure periods.

Risks of initial and subsequent CAD events (sudden CAD death, fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina, and stable angina) were estimated using new Framingham Heart Study risk equations and population risk profiles derived from national survey data. Costs were assumed to be those related to treatment of initial and subsequent CAD events (""event-related"") and follow-up care (""nonevent-related""), respectively. Cost estimates were derived primarily from national public-use databases. First-year direct medical costs of treating CAD events are estimated to be $17,532 for fatal AMI, $15,540 for nonfatal AMI, $2,569 for stable angina, $12,058 for unstable angina, and $713 for sudden CAD death. Nonevent-related direct costs of CAD treatment are estimated to be $1,051 annually. The annual incidence of CAD in the United States is estimated at 616,900 cases, with first-year costs of treatment totaling $5.54 billion. Five- and 10-year cumulative costs in 1995 dollars for patients who are initially free of CAD are estimated at $9.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively; for all patients with CAD, these costs are estimated to be $71.5 billion and $126.6 billion, respectively.

This index was designed to be linear with respect to perceived visual changes over its entire range in a way that is analogous to the decibel scale for sound. Neither visual range nor extinction coefficient have this useful property, which has resulted in their misuse for some applications. By assuming the availability of sensitive scenic targets at every distance, it can be demonstrated that any specific fractional change in extinction coefficient (or visual range) is equally perceptible regardless of baseline visibility conditions. The new index is defined so that its scale, which is expressed in deciview (dnu), is linear with respect to fractional changes in extinction coefficient, b(ext), as 10 ln(b(ext)/0.01 km-1), where extinction coefficient is expressed in km-1. A 1 dnu change is about a 10% change in extinction coefficient, which is a small but perceptible scenic change under many circumstances. Since the deciview scale is near zero for a pristine atmosphere (dnu = 0 for Rayleigh conditions at about 1.8 km elevation) and increases as visibility is degraded, it measures perceived haziness.

At that time, the committee concluded that neurodevelopmental toxicity was the most sensitive endpoint but recognized emerging evidence of potential cardiovascular effects at low levels of exposure. The committee recommended that these potential effects be addressed through the uncertainty factors applied to the development of the neurodevelopmental reference dose (RID). This approach was adopted by the US EPA in its derivation of the methylmercury RfD. Since that time, additional studies have become available. The available studies addressing the broad categories of heart disease (including myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic heart disease), hypertension, and heart rate variability are critically reviewed here. Overall, the evidence linking realistic rates of MeHg exposure from fish consumption to cardiovascular disease suggests an association with heart disease, particularly MI. The apparent antagonistic interaction of MeHg and n-3 fatty acids contained in fish suggests a causal mechanism. As different individuals and populations characteristically consume different species of fish, the risk of cardiovascular effects may not be a simple function of MeHg exposure but its assessment may well need to take n-3 fatty acid intake into account also. The case for significant adverse effects of MeHg on blood pressure at current levels of exposure is weaker. This effect, observed in childhood, does not appear to persist into adolescence, and animal studies are difficult to interpret given the high doses employed. The decrease in heart rate variability related to fetal exposure to MeHg in the same cohort appears to persist into early adolescence and may reflect developmental neurophysiological alterations that are consistent with the developmental neuropsychological effects also observed in that cohort. However, the cardiovascular significance of this effect with regard to its direct effect on health or its ability to predict other, more direct, health effects is unclear. At present, the studies of the Finnish cohort relating MeHg exposure to acute MI and coronary heart disease appear to provide the strongest basis for a formal quantitative risk assessment of the cardiovascular effects of MeHg.

The logic also offers a series of potentially observable ""predictions"" that can be used to gauge the plausibility of benefit transfers.

The method is illustrated using estimates for benefit measure changes in water quality from three studies: travel cost demand, hedonic property value, and contingent valuation analysis.

Here we present the major findings from a national scale air pollution assessment that is part of the United States' 2003 Report on Sustainable Forests. We examine trends and the percent forest subjected to specific levels of ozone and wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Results are reported by Resource Planning Act (RPA) reporting region and integrated by forest type using multivariate clustering. Estimates of sulfate deposition for forested areas had decreasing trends (1994-2000) across RPA regions that were statistically significant for North and South RPA regions. Nitrate deposition rates were relatively constant for the 1994 to 2000 period, but the South RPA region had a statistically decreasing trend. The North and South RPA regions experienced the highest ammonium deposition rates and showed slightly decreasing trends. Ozone concentrations were highest in portions of the Pacific Coast RPA region and relatively high across much of the South RPA region. Both the South and Rocky Mountain RPA regions had an increasing trend in ozone exposure. Ozone-induced foliar injury to sensitive species was recorded in all regions except for the Rocky Mountain region. The multivariate analysis showed that the oak-hickory and loblolly-shortleaf pine forest types were generally exposed to more air pollution than other forest types, and the redwood, western white pine, and larch forest types were generally exposed to less. These findings offer a new approach to national air pollution assessments and are intended to help focus research and planning initiatives related to air pollution and forest health.

Long-term soils data suggest that soil acidification has occurred in some spruce stands over the past 50 yr, with plant uptake and cation leaching both contributing to the loss of cations. Studies of tree ring chemistry also have indicated changes in Ca/Al and Mg/Al ratios in red spruce wood, suggesting increases in the ionic strength of soil solution. Irrigation studies using strong acid inputs have demonstrated accelerated displacement of base cations from upper horizons. Spruce-fir (Abies spp.) nutrient budgets indicate that current net Ca and Mg leaching loss rates are of the same order of magnitude as losses to whole tree harvest removals, spread out over a 50-yr rotation. For most cations, red spruce foliar nutrient levels decline with elevation, but it is difficult to assess the contribution of the elevational gradient in atmospheric deposition to this pattern. Compared to northeastern sites, spruce-fir soil solutions in the southern Appalachians have higher nitrate levels and higher Al concentrations, which at times approach the Al toxicity threshold for red spruce seedlings and frequently are at levels known to interfere with cation uptake. There is little evidence that either nutrient deficiencies or Al toxicity are primary causes of red spruce decline in the Northeast, though both may play a role in the Southeast. Major factors that could affect soil chemistry in spruce-fir stands in the future are (i) changes in S and N deposition, (ii) climate changes affecting soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient uptake, and (iii) tree mortality and physical disturbances to soils resulting in soil nitrate release.",Scholarly Journal,Cant find DOI2060-AP50,,3,Mechanistic analysis of plant responses to air pollution,Ecological Applications,1051-0761,"Winner, WE",10.2307/1941998 ,Nov-94,Oregon State University,,"Human activity is altering the chemistry of the atmosphere, which, in turn, is affecting the physiology and growth of plants. The purpose of this article is to develop four ideas that are currently emerging from the work of a diverse group of plant scientists. (1) Air pollution definitions: The definition of air pollution has been broadened, and research activities are expanding to include analysis of plant responses to a wide range of atmospheric chemicals emitted from anthropogenic sources but not previously considered as air pollutants. Thus experiments with CO2 and other trace gases are being pursued with approaches developed in air pollution research. (2) Air pollution uptake: Efforts are increasing to better quantify air pollution absorption rates through stomata in order to calculate actual dose vs, plant responses. The flux rates of gaseous pollutants into leaves, especially O-3, are largely dependent upon stomatal conductance. Approaches are being developed to calculate stomatal absorption of gaseous pollutants, based on stomatal conductance values for water vapor and ambient air-pollution concentrations. Calculation of air pollution absorption rates will allow responses of plants to pollutants to be assessed in toxicological frameworks and will help characterize the strength of vegetation as sinks for some gaseous pollutants. (3) Compensatory responses: Plant responses to air pollutants can be interpreted as compensatory, i.e., a physiological adjustment to an environmental stress that maximizes productivity above that which would have occurred in the absence of compensation. Examples of compensatory responses to air pollutants are shifts in root-to-shoot ratio and accelerated rates of leaf maturation. Recognition of compensatory responses to air pollutants allows these responses to be placed in a framework that relates to whole-plant processes and ecosystem functions. (4) Air pollution and multiple stresses: Air pollution stress seldom occurs in isolation, and research approaches are being developed around the concept of multiple interacting stresses. Multiple-stress experiments are important because factors such as plant water status, light, and nutrient availability are known to alter plant responses to air pollutants. Multiple-stress studies will involve experiments with model plant species and high degrees of environmental control and monitoring.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP50,,3,The benefits of pollution-control: the case of ozone and United States agriculture,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,0002-9092 ,"Adams, RM; Hamilton, SA; McCarl, BA",10.2307/1242135,Nov-86,Oregon State University; Northwest Economic Associates; Texas A&M University,US Environmental Protection Agency,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AP50,,3,A reassessment of the economic-effects of ozone on the United-States agriculture,Journal of the air & waste management association,1096-2247,"Adams, RM; Glyer, JD; Johnson, SL; McCarl, BA",,Jul-89,Oregon State University; Texas A&M University,US Environmental Protection Agency,,Scholarly Journal,Could not Find DOI 2060-AP50,,3,Willingness to Pay for Gains and Losses in Visibility and Health,Land Economics,0023-7639,"Loehman, ET; Park, S; Boldt, D",10.2307/3146642 ,Nov-94,Purdue University; West Georgia College,US Environmental Protection Agency,"Two different willingness-to-pay responses are compared-willingness to pay to avoid loss of air quality and willingness to pay to obtain gains in air quality.

In contrast, for those rules that use economic incentives, unit costs are consistently overestimated. The difference between the total-cost and the unit-cost results is caused by frequent errors in estimates of the effects of individual rules, which suggests, in turn, that the rule's benefits may also be overestimated.

After adjustment for demographic characteristics and medication use, HRV in each position was significantly inversely related to events in Cox proportional hazards models. With the exception of R-R interval length shift and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.98 for the smallest vs. the largest quartile), there was no association between HRV shift and the other events. Despite clinical research suggesting that HRV shift with standing is a more sensitive measure of autonomic balance than is HRV in one position, simple measures such as heart rate change and supine and standing HRV were better predictors of events.

This formula performs poorly because it ignores general equilibrium interactions - most important, interactions between the taxed commodity and the labor market. Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias. We derive an implementable alternative to the simple formula. This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.

We compare new estimates of the benefits and costs of Title IV to those made in 1990. Important changes in our understanding of and ability to quantify the benefits of Title IV have occurred. Benefits to human health now take a much higher profile because the contribution of SO2 and NOx emissions to the formation of fine particulate (PM2.5) is substantial, and evidence of the harmful human health effects Of PM2.5 has emerged in the last 15 years. New estimates of the health benefits Of PM2.5 reductions are the largest category of quantified health and environmental benefits and total over US$100 billion annually for 2010 when the program is expected to be fully implemented. Although important uncertainties exist in any specific estimate of the benefits, even if the estimates were calculated using more limiting assumptions and interpretations of the literature they would still substantially exceed the costs. Estimates of annualized costs for 20 10 are about US$3 billion, which is less than half of what was estimated in 1990. Research since 1990 also suggests that environmental problems associated with acid deposition and nitrogen deposition are more challenging to resolve than originally thought and will require larger reductions in emissions to reverse. The greater than expected benefits to human health, the greater vulnerability of natural resources and ecosystems, and the lower than expected costs all point to the conclusion that further reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants beyond those currently required by Title IV are warranted.

The acute phase of coronary artery disease (CAD) is dramatic and receives much attention because of its high mortality and associated treatment cost. However, the acute phase Typically resolves within 30 days whereas CAD is a chronic disease, which most patients will Live with for mare than a decade. We compared the clinical and economic burden of CAD during the acute phase (first 30 days) with that in The postacute phase (31st day through 10 years).METHODS. We included acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with significant CAD receiving an initial cardiac catheterization at Duke University Medical Center between 1986 and 1997 with follow-up continuing through 1998. Inpatient medical costs were estimated from ACS clinical trial and economic study data. Costs were adjusted to 1997 values and discounted at 3% per annum.RESULTS. Our study included 9,876 ACS patients (5,557 with an acute myocardial infarction [MI] anal 4,319 with unstable angina [UA]). Acute MI patients had higher 30-day mortality than UA patients (5.6% vs. 2.3%, P <0.001). In addition, acute MI and UA patients had significant 10-year unadjusted and adjusted survival differences (both P <0.001). For patients who survived to 30 days, there was no difference in 10-year survival between acute MI and UA patients before adjustment (P = 0.472). After adjustment, however, unstable angina patients who survived to 30 days had greater survival than myocardial infarction patients (P = 0.011). Mean 10-year discounted ACS inpatient medical costs were $45,253 ($23,510 acute phase and $21,819 postacute phase, P = 0.002). Ten year costs for unstable angina patients were $46,423 ($21,824 acute phase and $24,599 postacute phase, P = 0.003); ten year costs for myocardial infarction patients were $44,663 ($24,823 acute phase and $19,840 postacute phase, P <0.001).CONCLUSIONS. We found that the clinical and economic burden of CAD continues long after a patient's acute event has resolved and that postacute CAD cardiac event rates and inpatient medical costs may be higher than previously estimated. With much of all medical costs occurring in the postacute phase, the potential for effective secondary prevention therapies is substantial.

The reduced carbon storage would then require further reductions in fossil fuel emissions to meet a given CO2 concentration target, thereby increasing the cost of meeting the target. Simulations with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) for the historical period (1860-1995) show the largest damages occur in the Southeast and Midwestern regions of the United States, eastern Europe, and eastern China. The largest reductions in carbon storage for the period 1950-1995, 41%, occur in eastern Europe. Scenarios for the 21st century developed with the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM) lead to even greater negative effects on carbon storage in the future. In some regions, current land carbon sinks become carbon sources, and this change leads to carbon sequestration decreases of up to 0.4 Pg C yr(-1) due to damage in some regional ozone hot spots. With a climate policy, failing to consider the effects of ozone damage on carbon sequestration would raise the global costs over the next century of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations Of CO2 equivalents at 550 ppm by 6 to 21 %. Because stabilization at 550 ppm will reduce emission of other gases that cause ozone, these additional benefits are estimated to be between 5 and 25% of the cost of the climate policy. Tropospheric ozone effects on terrestrial ecosystems thus produce a surprisingly large feedback in estimating climate policy costs that, heretofore, has not been included in cost estimates.

In this paper, the authors present a framework for distinguishing estimates of attributable cases based on time-series studies from those based on cohort studies, the latter being 5-10 times larger. The authors distinguish four categories of death associated with air pollution: A) air pollution increases both the risk of underlying diseases leading to frailty and the short term risk of death among the frail; B) air pollution increases the risk of chronic diseases leading to frailty but is unrelated to timing of death; C) air pollution is unrelated to risk of chronic diseases but short term exposure increases mortality among persons who are frail; and D) neither underlying chronic disease nor the event of death is related to air pollution exposure. Time-series approaches capture deaths from categories A and C, whereas cohort studies assess cases from categories A, B, and C. In addition, years of life lost can only be derived from cohort studies, where time to death is the outcome, while in time-series studies, death is a once-only event (no dimension in time).

To address these points, the following subgroups of children were selected from a survey population of all 2,200 elementary school children (6 to 13 yr of age) in a pulp mill community on the west coast of Vancouver Island: (1) all children with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 75 participated), (2) all children with an exercise-induced fall in FEV1 without diagnosed asthma (n = 57), (3) all children with airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.76) without either of the above (n = 18), and (4) control children without any of the above (n = 56). The children were followed for as long as 18 mo with twice daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and daily symptom diary recording. Maximum daily PM10 concentration was 159 mu m/m(3) (median, 22.1), but only 8 d (1.2%) had concentrations above 100 mu g/m(3). In an analysis that accounted for time-varying covariates, and serially correlated and missing data, for the entire sample of children, increases in PM10 were associated with reductions in PEF and increased reporting of cough, phlegm production, and sore throat. For the subgroup of children with diagnosed asthma, PEF in the time period with the highest PM10 concentrations fell by an estimated 0.55 L/min (95% CI, 0.06 to 1.05) for a 10 mu g/m(3) PM10 increase above the mean daily PM10 concentration of 27.3 mu g/m(3) and the odds of reported cough increased by 8% (95% CI, 0 to 16%); no consistent effects were observed in the other groups of children. It is concluded that children experience reductions in PEF and increased symptoms after increases in relatively low ambient PM10 concentrations, and that children with diagnosed asthma are more susceptible to these effects than are other children.

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes.Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are lessthan/equal 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter [PM(sub 2.5)]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models.Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM(sub 2.5) or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM(sub 2.5) was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used.Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM(sub 2.5) was taken into account. We did, however, demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory causes in association with an increase in ozone concentration.

We hypothesized that this paradox could be in part explained by high mercury content in fish.Methods and Results We studied the relation of the dietary intake of fish and mercury, as well as hair content and urinary excretion of mercury, to the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and any cause in 1833 men aged 42 to 60 years who were free of clinical CHD, stroke, claudication, and cancer. Of these, 73 experienced an AMI in 2 to 7 years. Of the 78 deceased men, 18 died of CHD and 24 died of CVD. Men who had consumed local nonfatty fish species had elevated hair mercury contents. In Cox models with the major cardiovascular risk factors as covariates, dietary intakes of fish and mercury were associated with significantly increased risk of AMI and death from CHD, CVD, and any death. Men in the highest tertile (greater than or equal to 2.0 mu g/g) of hair mercury content had a 2.0-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.1; P=.005) age- and CHD-adjusted risk of AMI and a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 6.6; P=.014) adjusted risk of cardiovascular death compared with those with a lower hair mercury content. In a nested case-control subsample, the 24-hour urinary mercury excretion had a significant (P=.042) independent association with the risk of AMI. Both the hair and urinary mercury associated significantly with titers of immune complexes containing oxidized LDL.Conclusions These data suggest that a high intake of mercury from nonfatty freshwater fish and the consequent accumulation of mercury in the body are associated with an excess risk of AMI as well as death from CHD, CVD, and any cause in Eastern Finnish men and this increased risk may be due to the promotion of lipid peroxidation by mercury.

Subjects were randomly selected and included 1871 men aged 42 to 60 years who had no clinical coronary heart disease at baseline examination. A total of 194 men had a fatal or nonfatal acute coronary event during follow-up. In a Cox proportional hazards' model adjusting for other risk factors, men in the highest fifth of the proportion of serum DHA-I-DPA in all fatty acids had a 44% reduced risk (P=0.014) of acute coronary events compared with men in the lowest fifth.

There was no association between proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid and the risk of acute coronary events.Conclusions-Our data provide further confirmation for the concept that fish oil-derived fatty acids reduce the risk of acute coronary events.

We therefore investigated whether high hair mercury content is associated with accelerated progression of carotid atherosclerosis, determined by ultrasonographic assessment of common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), in a prospective study among 1014 men aged 42-60 years. In a linear regression model adjusting for other atherosclerotic risk factors, high hair mercury content was one of the strongest predictors of the 4-year increase in the mean IMT (P = 0.0007). On the average, for each mu g/g increase in hair mercury content, there was an increment of 8 mu m (7.3% of the mean) in the 4-year IMT increase.

At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms for this association are under study. Low heart rate variability, a marker of poor cardiac autonomic control, is associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. To address the possible mechanisms for PM-cardiovascular disease mortality, we examined the cardiac autonomic response to daily variations in PM in 26 elderly (mean age 81) individuals for 3 consecutive weeks. Several standardized methods were used to measure 24-hr average PM concentrations prior to the clinical test inside (indoor PM2.5) and immediately outside (outdoor PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) of participants' residences. Resting, supine, 6-min R wave to R wave (R-R) interval data were collected to estimate high frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) and low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) powers and standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) as cardiac autonomic control indices. Participant-specific lower heart rate variability days were defined as days for which the high-frequency indices fell below the first tertile of the individual's high-frequency distribution over the study period. Indoor PM2.5 > 15 mu g/m(3) was used to define high pollution days. Results show that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of low heart rate variability high frequency for high (vs. not high) pollution days was 3.08 (1.43, 6.59). The beta-coefficients (standard error) from mixed models to assess the quantitative relationship between variations in indoor PM2.5 and the log-transformed high frequency, low frequency, and SDNN were: -0.029 (0.010), -0.027 (0.009), and -0.004 (0.003), respectively. This first study of cardiac autonomic control response to daily variations of PM2.5 indicates that increased levels of PM2.5 are associated with lower cardiac autonomic control, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between PM and cardiovascular disease mortality.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP50,,3,The effects of ambient air pollution on school absenteeism due to respiratory illnesses,Epidemiology,1044-3983,"Gilliland, FD; Berhane, K; Rapaport, EB; Thomas, DC; Avol, E; Gauderman, WJ; London, SJ; Margolis, HG; McConnell, R; Islam, KT; Peters, JM",10.1097/00001648-200101000-00009,1-Jan,University of Southern California; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; California Air Resources Board,"California Air Resources Board; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; US Environmental Protection Agency; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Hastings Foundation","We investigated the relations between ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and respirable particles less than 10 mum in diameter (PM10) and school absenteeism in a cohort of 4th-grade school children who resided in 12 southern California communities.

To examine acute effects of air pollution on absence rates, we fitted a two-stage time series model to the absence count data that included distributed lag effects of exposure adjusted for long-term pollutant levels. Short-term change in O-3, but not NO2 or PM10, was associated with a substantial increase in school absences from both upper and lower respiratory illness. An increase of 20 ppb of O-3 was associated with an increase of 62.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 18.4-124.1%] for illness-related absence rates, 82.9% (95% CI = 3.9-222.0%) for respiratory illnesses, 45.1% (95% CI = 21.3-73.7%) for upper respiratory illnesses, and 173.9% (95% CI = 91.3-292.3%) for lower respiratory illnesses with wet cough.

Mercury concentrations were determined in cord blood and in the child's hair.Results Both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) activities decreased by about 25% from 7 to 14 years; they correlated well with the blood pressures. A doubling of prenatal MeHg exposure was associated with a decrease in LF and HF powers of about 6.7% (P = .04) and in the coefficient of variation of the electrocardiographic R-R interval of 2.7% (P = .04) at age 14 years. No discernible effect on blood pressure was apparent. Decreased LF variability was associated with increased latency of BAEP peak III, but adjustment for MeHg exposure substantially attenuated this correlation.Conclusions Methylmercury exposure was associated with decreased sympathetic (LF) and parasympathetic (HF) modulation of the HRV. Parallel MeHg-related delays of BAEP latencies may be caused by underlying MeHg neurotoxicity to brainstem nuclei.

People with asthma represent one such group. We undertook a study of the relation between measured ambient air pollutants in Seattle and nonelderly hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of asthma. We regressed daily hospital admissions to local hospitals for area residents from 1987 through 1994 on particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 and PM2.5, respectively); coarse particulate mass; sulfur dioxide (SO2); ozone (O-3); and carbon monoxide (CO) in a Poisson regression model with control for time trends, seasonal variations, and temperature-related weather effects. With the exception of seasonally monitored O-3, we supplemented incomplete pollutant measures in a multiple imputation model to create a complete time series of exposure measures. We found an estimated 4-5% increase in the rate of asthma hospital admissions associated with an interquartile range change in PM (19 mu g/m(3) PM10,11.8 mu g/m(3) PM2.5, and 9.3 mu g/m(3) coarse particulate mass) lagged I day; relative rates were as follows: for PM10 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.08]; for PM2.5, 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02-1.07); and for coarse particulate mass, 1.04 (95% CI = 1.01-1.07).

We previously conducted a study showing a relationship between asthma visits in all persons < 65 years of age to emergency departments (EDs) and air pollution in Seattle, Washington. In that study the most frequent zip codes of the visits were in the inner city. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health (Seattle, WA) subsequently published a report which showed that the hospitalization rate for children in the inner city was over 600/100,000, whereas it was < 100/100,000 for children living in the suburbs. Therefore, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether asthma visits to hospital emergency departments in the inner city of Seattle were associated,vith outdoor air pollution levels. ED visits to six hospitals for asthma and daily air pollution data were obtained for 15 months during 1995 and 1996. The association between air pollution and childhood ED visits for asthma from the inner city area with high asthma hospitalization rates were compared with those from lower hospital utilization areas. Daily ED counts were regressed against fine particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide using a semiparametric Poisson regression model. Significant associations were found between ED visits for asthma in children and fine PM and CO. A change of 11 mu g/m(3) in fine PM was associated with a relative rate of 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.23]. There was no stronger association between ED visits for asthma and air pollution in the higher hospital utilization area than in the lower utilization area. These findings were seen when estimated PM2.5 concentrations were below the newly adopted annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 15 mu g/m(3).

Indirect medical costs included costs resulting from missed work or school and days with restricted activity at work. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and inflated to 1994 dollars. The total estimated cost was $5.8 billion (95% CI, $3.6 to $8 billion).

Hospitalization accounted for more than half of all expenditures. More than 80% of resources were used by 20% of the population (defined as 'high-cost patients'). The estimated annual per patient cost for those high-cost patients was $2,584, in contrast with $140 for the rest of the sample.

One quarter of the households reporting fishing activity consumed fish at least once per week. The most commonly reported species caught, white bass, was captured twice as often as the next most frequently reported species.

Parallel decreases have been observed in the surface waters of the lake. Here we extend the observations to the fish community and we present evidence of a contemporaneous decline in levels of Hg in fish tissue. By comparing data from two separated basins of the lake, we then make an initial effort to isolate and quantify the relative importance of de-acidification and reduced Hg deposition on mercury contamination in fish. Statistical modeling indicates that fish Hg in both basins decreased by roughly 30% between 1994 and 2000 (-5%/y) due to decreased atmospheric Hg loading. De-acidification could account for an additional 5% decrease in one basin (-0.8%/y) and a further 30% decrease in the other basin (-5%/y), since the basins de-acidified at very different rates. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that depositional inputs of SO(4) and Hg((II)) co-mediate the biosynthesis of methyl mercury and thereby co-limit bioaccumulation. And they suggest that modest changes in acid rain or mercury deposition can significantly affect mercury bioaccumulation over short-time scales. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This market offers firms facing high marginal abatement costs the opportunity to purchase the right to emit SO2 from firms with lower costs, and this is expected to yield cost savings compared to a command-and-control approach to environmental regulation. This paper uses econometrically estimated marginal abatement cost functions for power plants affected by Title IV of the CAAA to evaluate the performance of the SO2 allowance market. Specifically, we investigate whether the much-heralded fall in the cost of abating SO,, compared to original estimates, can be attributed to allowance trading. We demonstrate that, for plants that use low-sulfur coal to reduce SO, emissions, technical change and the fall in prices of low-sulfur coal have lowered marginal abatement cost curves by over 50 percent since 1985. The flexibility to take advantage of these changes is the main source of cost reductions, rather than trading per se. In the long run, allowance trading may achieve cost savings of $700-$800 million per year compared to an ""enlightened"" command-and-control program characterized by a uniform emission rate standard. The cost savings would be twice as great if the alternative to trading were forced scrubbing. However, a comparison of potential cost savings in 1995 and 1996 with modeled costs of actual emissions suggests that most trading gains were unrealized in the first two years of the program.

S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has developed a number of policies to reduce air pollution, including PM2.5. To assist in the benefit-cost analyses of these air pollution control policies, the U. S. EPA has developed the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP). BenMAP is meant to (1) provide a flexible tool for systematically analyzing impacts of changes in environmental quality in a timely fashion, (2) ensure that stakeholders can understand the assumptions underlying the analysis, and (3) adequately address uncertainty and variability. BenMAP uses a ""damage-function"" approach to estimate the health benefits of a change in air quality. The major components of the damage-function approach are population estimates, population exposure, adverse health effects, and economic costs. To demonstrate BenMAP's ability to analyze PM2.5 pollution control policy scenarios, we assess two sample applications: (1) benefits of a national-level air quality control program, and ( 2) benefits of attaining two annual PM2.5 standards in California ( annual average standards of 15 mu g/m(3) and 12 mu g/m(3)). In the former, we estimate a scenario where control of PM2.5 emissions results in $100 billion of benefits annually. In the analysis of alternative standards, we estimate that attaining the more stringent standard (12 mu g/m(3)) would result in approximately 2000 fewer premature deaths each year than the 15 mu g/m(3) achieves. BenMAP has a number of features to help clarify the analysis process. It allows the user to record in a configuration all of the choices made during an analysis. Configurations are especially useful for recreating already existing policy analyses. Also, BenMAP has a number of reporting options, including a set of mapping tools that allows users to visually inspect their inputs and results.

For low birth weight babies, high PM10 exposure was associated, but not significantly, with mortality from respiratory causes [OR = 1.18, (0.86, 1.61)]. This study suggests that particulate matter is associated with risk of postneonatal mortality. Continued attention should be paid to air quality to ensure optimal health of infants in the United States.

Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing HIA methods at local scales, in the context of Environmental Public Health Tracking and in other settings. This paper investigates the data and analytical challenges to estimating the incidence of health effects associated with changes in air pollution concentrations at the local scale, focusing on ozone and fine particulate matter. Although it could be argued that the local-scale HIA is simply a more geographically discrete version of the national-scale assessment and, therefore, has similar challenges, in practice, many key inputs in national-scale assessments are assumed to be spatially uniform or vary only at coarse geographic resolution. For a national-scale assessment, this assumption may not contribute appreciable bias, but the bias could be significant for any individual location. Thus, local-scale assessments require more geographically resolved air quality data, concentration–response (C-R) functions, and baseline incidence rates than are often used. However, comprehensive local data may not be available, may be incomplete, or may be time-intensive and resource-intensive to develop, especially for C-R functions for which small-scale epidemiological studies will often be underpowered. Given this context, this paper considers how best to develop credible local-scale HIAs, identifying factors that contribute to variability across geographic areas, study designs, and time periods. This paper also describes which key sources of analytical uncertainty change as the scope shifts from the national to the local scale. These challenges notwithstanding, the paper concludes that a well-designed local-scale HIA, following key principles and recommendations, can be both informative and defensible",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP50,,3,Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and selected causes of postneonatal infant mortality in California,Environmental Health Perspectives,0091-6765,"Woodruff, TJ; Parker, JD; Schoendorf, KC",10.1289/ehp.8484,6-May,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Center for Health Statistics,,"Studies suggest that airborne particulate matter (PM) may be associated with postneonatal infant mortality, particularly with respiratory causes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). To further explore this issue, we examined the relationship between long-term exposure to fine PM air pollution and postneonatal infant mortality in California. We linked monitoring data for PM ! 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) to infants born in California in 1999 and 2000 using maternal addresses for mothers who lived within 5 miles of a PM2.5 monitor. We matched each postneonatal infant death to four infants surviving to I year of age, by birth weight category and date of birth (within 2 weeks). For each matched set, we calculated exposure as the average PM2.5 concentration over the period of life for the infant who died. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds of postneonatal all-cause, respiratory-related, SIDS, and external-cause (a control category) mortality by exposure to PM2.5, controlling for the matched sets and maternal demographic factors. We matched 788 postneonatal infant deaths to 3,089 infant survivors, with 51 and 120 postneonatal deaths due to respiratory causes and SIDS, respectively. We found an adjusted odds ratio for a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 of 1.07 [95% confidence interval (Cl), 0.93-1.241 for overall postneonatal mortality, 2.13 (95% Cl, 1.12-4.05) for respiratory- related postneonatal mortality, 0.82 (95% Cl, 0.55-1.23) for SIDS, and 0.83 (95% Cl, 0.50-1-39) for external causes. The California findings add further evidence of a PM air pollution effect on respiratory-related postneonatal infant mortality.

In this paper, we use household and recreation group data for a spruce fir forest high in the Appalachian Mountains of the U. S. to evaluate the benefits from forest protection (i. e., from improving the forest condition). Our benefits estimation procedures use the referendum-type, contingent valuation (CV) approach of Cameron (1988). We modify the usual practice of obtaining a single willingness-to-pay (WTP) value by using alternative questionnaire scenarios and conducting tests to examine i) household and recreation group value sensitivity to forest condition, and ii) recreation group differences in WTP for forest protection. A first sample of southeastern U. S. households was asked to value a forest protection program for a spruce-fir forest showing no impact from insect disturbance or atmospheric deposition. The second sample was asked to value a protection program for a forest already experiencing impact from insect infestation and air pollution. Logit analysis of the two samples revealed no statistically significant difference in household WTP between the two forest protection programs. Further analysis indicated that consumptive forest users (i. e., hunters and anglers) held forest protection values that were sensitive to a change forest condition, while nonconsumptive forest users (i. e., campers and hikers) held values that were insensitive to the same condition change. Recreation group comparisons revealed that consumptive forest users also held lower values for forest protection than nonconsumptive recreationists. These results demonstrate the importance of estimating public values for forest protection in terms of heterogeneous groups rather than as a homogeneous whole.

At baseline, in 1987 to 1989, 2-minute rhythm strips were recorded. Time-domain measures of HRV were determined in a random sample of 900 subjects, for all subjects with incident CHD (395 subjects), and for all deaths (443 subjects) that occurred through 1993. Relative rates of incident CHD and cause-specific death in tertiles of HRV were computed with Poisson regression for the case-cohort design. Subjects with low HRV had an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and an elevated risk of incident CHD and death. The increased risk of death could not be attributed to a specific cause and could not be explained by other risk factors,Conclusions-Low HRV was associated with increased risk of CHD and death from several causes, It is hypothesized that low HRV is a marker of less favorable health.

We compared results with pooled estimates from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), a time-series study of 95 large U.S. urban centers from 1987 to 2000.Results: Both meta-analysis and NMMAPS results provided strong evidence of a short-term association between ozone and mortality, with larger effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, the elderly, and current-day ozone exposure. In both analyses, results were insensitive to adjustment for particulate matter and model specifications. In the meta-analysis, a 10-ppb increase in daily ozone at single-day or 2-day average of lags 0, 1, or 2 days was associated with an 0.87% increase in total mortality (95% posterior interval = 0.55% to 1.18%), whereas the lag 0 NMMAPS estimate is 0.25% (0.12% to 0.39%). Several findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS; meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger than with NMMAPS.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-today variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.Objective To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.Design and Setting Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.Main Outcome Measure Daily counts of total non-injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.Results A 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day's exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.Conclusions These results indicate a statistically significant association between short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban communities, which include about 40% of the total US population. The findings indicate that this widespread pollutant adversely affects public health.

The objectives of the present study were to examine cytogenetic functions in peripheral lymphocytes within a population living on the banks of the Tapajos River with respect to methylmercury (MeHg) contamination, using hair mercury as a biological indicator of exposure. Our investigation shows a clear relation between methylmercury contamination and cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes at levels well below 50 micrograms/gram, the level at which initial clinical signs and symptoms of mercury poisoning occur. The first apparent biological effect with increasing MeHg hair level was the impairment of lymphocyte proliferation measured as mitotic index (MI). The relation between mercury concentration in hair and MI suggests that this parameter, an indicator of changes in lymphocytes and their ability to respond to culture conditions, may be an early marker of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in humans and should be taken into account in the preliminary evaluation of the risks to populations exposed it? vivo. This is the first report showing clear cytotoxic effects of long-term exposure to MeHg. Although the results strongly suggest that, under the conditions examined here, MeHg is both a spindle poison and a clastogen, the biological significance of these observations are as yet unknown. A long-term follow-up of these subjects should be undertaken.

While there is correlation among lakes between depressed pH and high mercury concentrations in fish, the cause of this problem is unknown. A number of hypotheses have been advanced in explanation, including increased mercury deposition, changes in mercury mobility due to acidification, pH dependent changes in mercury uptake by biota, and alterations in population size and/or structure which result in increased bioaccumulation in fish. Because fish accumulate mercury mainly in an organic form, methylmercury, changes in the biogeochemical cycling of this compound might account for elevated bioaccumulation. Mercury methylation is predominantly a microbial process which occurs in situ in lakes. This review focuses on microbiological and biogeochemical changes that may lead to increased levels of methylmercury in fresh waters impacted by acid-deposition. In particular, we focus on the hypothesis that sulfate-reducing bacteria are important mediators of metal methylation in aquatic systems and, moreover, that sulfate-deposition may stimulate methylmercury production by enhancing the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in sediments.

Strong binding of mercury by DOM is attributed to coordination of mercury at reduced sulfur sites within the organic matter, which are present at concentrations much higher than mercury concentrations found in most natural waters. The ability of organic matter to enhance the dissolution and inhibit the precipitation of mercuric sulfide, a highly insoluble solid, suggests that DOM competes with sulfide for mercury binding. This is confirmed by very high conditional stability constants for mercury-organic sulfur (RSHg) complexes (10(25)-10(32)) recently reported in literature. DOM appears to play a key role in the photochemical reduction of ionic mercury to elemental mercury and subsequent reoxidation of elemental mercury to ionic mercury, thus affecting volatilization loss and bioavailability of mercury to organisms. DOM affects the production and bioaccumulation of methylmercury, the most bioaccumulative mercury species in fish. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The performance of the CTMs was evaluated against available data. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) for observed versus simulated annual mercury wet deposition fluxes over North America was 0.50 with average normalized error and bias of 25% and 11%, respectively. The CTMs were used to conduct a global source attribution for selected receptor areas. Three global emission scenarios were used that differed in their distribution of background emissions among direct natural emissions and re-emissions of natural and anthropogenic mercury. North American anthropogenic sources were calculated to contribute only from 25 to 32% to the total mercury deposition over the continental United States. At selected receptors, the contribution of North American anthropogenic emissions ranges from 9 to 81%; Asian anthropogenic emissions were calculated to contribute from 5 to 36%; natural emissions were calculated to contribute from 6 to 59%.

However, linkages between growth and ambient ozone concentrations in the field are not well established for forest trees. Ambient ozone concentrations have been shown to cause foliar injury on a number of tree species throughout much of the eastern USA. Symptom expression is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors and, therefore, ozone-exposure/tree-response relationships have been difficult to confirm. Clearly defined, cause-effect relationships between visible injury and growth losses due to ozone have not been validated. Generalizations of sensitivity of forest trees to ozone are complicated by tree development stage, microclimate, leaf phenology, compensatory processes, within-species variation and other interacting stresses. In general, decreases in above-ground growth at ambient ozone levels in the eastern USA appear to be in the range of 0-10% per year. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of tree species, with the vast majority of studies involving individual tree seedlings in a non-competitive environment. Comparative studies of small and large trees indicate that seedlings are not suitable surrogates for predicting responses of mature trees to ozone. Process-level modelling is a promising methodology that has been recently utilized to assess ozone effects on a stand to regional scale, indicating that ozone is affecting forest growth in the eastern USA. The extent and magnitude of the response is variable and depends on many edaphic and climatic factors. It is imperative when conducting assessment exercises, however, that forest biologists constantly keep in mind the tremendous variability that exists within natural systems.

This article compares numerically estimated expected values of key aggregate economic variables for two levels of target prices (i. e. supported price level) from deterministic and stochastic formulations of AGSIM, which is a large-scale econometric simulation model of crop and livestock production in the United States.For nominal target prices set by the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Bill (FACT), the deterministic formulation underestimated the level of deficiency payments (the difference between target price and market price) by a cumulative total of $800 million (6.2%) over the 5 year life of the Bill compared to estimates from the stochastic model. For target prices 10% below the FACT levels, the deterministic model underestimated deficiency payments by $1220 million (36.8%). Much of the economic impact estimation bias can be attributed to price received by participating producers under FACT having a probability distribution truncated at the target price, which is a strong departure from the certainty equivalent requirements needed to have mean outcomes from stochastic models equal outcomes from their deterministic counterpart.Estimated changes in deficiency payments from lowering target prices by 10% were overestimated by $420 million (4.3%) with the deterministic model, which suggests that deterministic models are less biased for estimating the change in deficiency payments than in estimating the level of payments.The bias associated with mean values of other variables, such as crop prices and farm income, was much less in percentage terms than bias in estimates of deficiency payments.

Most exist in natural waters as metal cations that are complexed to varying degrees by inorganic and organic ligands. Metal ions are generally taken up into cells by membrane transport proteins designed for acquisition of nutrient metals (Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Cu, Mo). Organic ligands compete with these transport proteins for binding metal ions, and consequently, organic complexation substantially decreases metal uptake rates. Typically, the chelated metal is not directly available for cellular uptake, and metal uptake is controlled by either the concentration of free aquo ions or that of kinetically labile inorganic species. The coordination sites of transport proteins, however, are not entirely specific for intended nutrient metals, and consequently will bind with and transport non-nutritive or toxic metals. Competition for membrane transport sites and for intracellular metabolic binding sites can substantially influence the uptake of both nutrient and toxic metals and resultant effects on growth rate. Such growth rate effects provide feedback on cellular metal concentrations since the amount of metal accumulated within cells represents a balance between the rate of metal uptake and the cellular growth rate, the effective biodilution rate. Phytoplankton have provided useful model systems for investigating the processes and associated chemical and biological factors regulating cellular metal accumulation and resultant physiological effects.

Nevertheless, we find no evidence that local air quality regulation substantially reduced employment, even when allowing for induced plant exit and dissuaded plant entry. Regulations affected employment only slightly - partly because regulated plants are in capital and not labor-intensive industries. These findings are robust to the choice of comparison regions.

Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures).

Associations with specific cardiopulmonary diseases might be useful in exploring potential mechanistic pathways linking exposure and mortality.Methods and Results - General pathophysiological pathways linking long-term PM exposure with mortality and expected patterns of PM mortality with specific causes of death were proposed a priori. Vital status, risk factor, and cause-of-death data, collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, were linked with air pollution data from United States metropolitan areas. Cox Proportional Hazard regression models were used to estimate PM-mortality associations with specific causes of death. Long-term PM exposures were most strongly associated with mortality attributable to ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. For these cardiovascular causes of death, a 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine PM was associated with 8% to 18% increases in mortality risk, with comparable or larger risks being observed for smokers relative to nonsmokers. Mortality attributable to respiratory disease had relatively weak associations.Conclusions - Fine particulate air pollution is a risk factor for cause-specific cardiovascular disease mortality via mechanisms that likely include pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and altered cardiac autonomic function. Although smoking is a much larger risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, exposure to fine PM imposes additional effects that seem to be at least additive to if not synergistic with smoking.

Methylmercury was determined by KOH/methanol digestion using aqueous phase ethylation, cryogenic gas chromatography, and CVAFS detection.

The observed proportion of total mercury (as CH3Hg) ranged from 69 to 1 32%, with a relative standard deviation for quintuplicate analysis of about 10%; nearly all of this variability can be explained by the analytical variability of total mercury and CH3Hg. Poorly homogenized samples showed greater variability, primarily because total mercury and CH3Hg were measured on separate aliquots, which vary in mercury concentration, not speciation. I conclude that for all species studied, virtually all (> 95%) of the mercury present is as CH3Hg and that past reports of substantially lower CH3Hg fractions may have been biased by analytical and homogeneity variability.

Polluting industries spread out, moving from nonattainment (polluted) to attainment (initially less polluted) areas.

The scaling-up of mercury flux measurements to regional or global scales is confounded by a limited understanding of the physical, chemical and biochemical processes that occur in the soil, a complex environmental matrix. This study is a first step toward the development of an air-surface exchange model for. mercury (known as the mercury emission model (MEM)). The objective of the study is to model the partitioning and movement of inorganic Hg(II) and Hg(0) in open field soils, and to use MEM to interpret published data on mercury emissions to the atmosphere. MEM is a multi-layered, dynamic finite-element soil and atmospheric surface-layer,model that simulates the exchange of heat, moisture and mercury between soils and the atmosphere. The model includes a simple formulation of the reduction of inorganic Hg(II) to Hg(0). Good agreement was found between the meteorological dependence of observed mercury emission fluxes, and hourly modelled fluxes, and it is concluded that MEM is able to simulate well the soil and atmospheric processes influencing the emission of Hg(0) to the atmosphere. The heretofore unexplained close correlation between soil temperature and mercury emission flux is fully modelled by MEM and is attributed to the temperature dependence of the Hg(0) Henry's Law coefficient and the control of the volumetric soil-air fraction on the diffusion, of Hg(0) near the surface. The observed correlation between solar radiation intensity and mercury flux, appears in part to be due to the surface-energy balance between radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes which determines the soil temperature. The modelled results imply that empirical correlations that are based only on flux chamber data, may not extend to the open atmosphere for all weather scenarios. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million (ill 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ""best practice"" assumptions are invoked. This range is considerably below many previous qualitative reviews of this literature. (C) 2002 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

Complexation of methylmercury as methylmercury-bisulfide decreased the phytoplankton uptake rate while the uptake rate of the methylmercury-cysteine and -thiourea complexes increased with increasing complexation by these ligands. Furthermore, our results indicated that while different ligands influenced inorganic mercury/methylmercury uptake by phytoplankton cells, the ligand complex had no major influence on either where the mercury was sequestered within the phytoplankton cell nor the assimilation efficiency of the mercury by copepods. The assimilation efficiency of inorganic mercury/methylmercury by copepods and amphipods feeding on algal cells was compared and both organisms assimilated methylmercury much more efficiently; the relative assimilation efficiency of methylmercury to inorganic mercury was 2.0 for copepods and 2.8 for amphipods. The relative assimilation is somewhat concentration dependent as experiments showed that as exposure concentration increased, a greater percentage of methylmercury was found in the cytoplasm of phytoplankton cells, resulting in a higher concentration in the copepods feeding on these cells. Additionally, food quality influenced assimilation by invertebrates. During decay of a T. weissflogii culture, which served as food for the invertebrates, copepods were increasingly less able to assimilate the methylmercury from the food, while even at advanced stages of decay, amphipods were able to assimilate mercury from their food to a high degree. Finally, fish feeding on copepods assimilated methylmercury more efficiently than inorganic mercury owing to the larger fraction of methylmercury found in the soft tissues of the copepods.

A large body of literature detailing bioaccumulation and effects on birds has revealed the potential for mercury to adversely impact avian physiology and reproduction. However, the extent to which these effects impair survival remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether mercury exposure was associated with reduced annual survivorship in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding at a site with legacy industrial contamination. From 2005 to 2008, we captured and marked 932 adult swallows. We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and an information-theoretic approach to test our hypotheses that adult survival varied by sex, breeding location, and cumulative individual mercury exposure. Blood mercury was significantly elevated on contaminated sites (2005-2007 combined mean +/- A SE: 2.84 +/- A 0.09 mu g/g; reference: 0.17 +/- A 0.01 mu g/g). Model-averaged estimates of female apparent survival ranged from 0.483 to 0.488 on reference sites and 0.473 to 0.477 on contaminated sites. For males, apparent survival ranged from 0.451 to 0.457 on reference sites and 0.444 to 0.448 on contaminated sites. Thus, we observed approximately a 1% difference in survival between mercury-contaminated and reference sites. Such a small difference is unlikely to impact population viability in this short-lived species; however, some songbirds accumulate mercury to a greater degree than tree swallows and do not possess the migratory behavior that removes swallows to less contaminated areas for the majority of the year. Identifying whether such species are at risk of suffering biologically significant reductions in survival should become a focus of future research.

The integrated bioenergetics-based stressor-response model (SRM) was evaluated by comparing observed and predicted growth of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exposed to several dieldrin concentrations and by conducting sensitivity analyses. Predictions of the SRM suggest that energetic effects of exposure of largemouth bass to ambient concentrations of dieldrin in lakes at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge are not biologically significant because the amount of energy lost by resident fish is small compared with variation in food consumption. Furthermore, influence of dieldrin exposure is small compared with the effects of a natural stressor like water temperature. The SRM provides a general framework for integrating laboratory-derived exposure-response relationships with ecological processes to determine the biological significance of multiple stressors in a natural environment. Comparisons of relative effects of anthropogenic and natural stressors can be used to assess potential costs and benefits of alternative ecosystem management strategies.

A sunlight-mediated, in situ reduction of oxidized Hg to volatile elemental mercury (Hg-0) resulted in the atmospheric transport of Hg from land-applied sludge. The reduction of oxidized Hg to Hg-O occurred in a shallow layer of surface soil (<0.5 cm), where light penetration was possible. Sludge application increased soil Hg-0 emission by 1-2 orders of magnitude, to a daily average emission rate of similar to 100 ng m(-2) h(-1) greater than background. In the United States and Europe, municipal sewage sludge application to land may be responsible for the flux of similar to 5 x 10(6) g yr(-1) of Hg-0 to the atmosphere. Considering that municipal sludge is used extensively as a soil amendment worldwide, the land application of sewage sludge warrants further study as a global source of atmospheric Hg. This research calls into question the stability of any land application of Hg-contaminated materials; all surface application of Hg waste represents a potential source of atmospheric Hg-0.

The high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in fish has been suggested to be a protective factor. In addition, fish is the entirely dominating source of methylmercury for the general population, and the concentration of Hg in erythrocytes (Ery-Hg) is often used as an index of fish consumption. Our aim was to study the relationships between a first-ever myocardial infarction, Ery-Hg, activity of gluthathione peroxidase in erythrocytes (Ery-GSH-Px) and plasma concentration of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (P-PUFA). In a population-based prospective nested case-control study within Northern Sweden seventy-eight cases of a first-ever myocardial infarction were compared with 156 controls with respect to Ery-Hg, P-PUFA and Ery-GSH-Px. Both Ery-Hg and P-PUFA, but not Ery-GSH-Px, were significantly (P<0.0001) higher in subjects reporting high fish intake (at least one meal per week) than in those with lower intake. This finding suggests that Ery-Hg and P-PUFA reflect previous long-term fish intake. Low risk of myocardial infarction was associated with high Ery-Hg or high P-PUFA. In a multivariate model the risk of myocardial infarction was further reduced in subjects with both high Ery-Hg and high P-PUFA (odds ratio 0.16, 95 % CI 0.04, 0.65). In conclusion, there is a strong inverse association between the risk of a first myocardial infarction and the biomarkers of fish intake, Ery-Hg and P-PUFA, and this association is independent of traditional risk factors.

This paper uses an areal measure of traffic density as a surrogate index of exposure to vehicular traffic. We present associations between county-level traffic density (annual vehicle-km traveled km(-2)), ambient air quality, and mortality in a cohort of about 70,000 male US veterans (the Washington University-EPRI Veterans Cohort) who were enrolled in 1976 and followed through 2001. Traffic density is seen to be a significant and robust predictor of survival in this cohort, more so than ambient air quality, with the possible exception of ozone. Stronger effects of traffic density are seen in the counties that have ambient air quality monitoring data, which also tend to have higher levels of traffic density. These proportional-hazard modeling results indicate only modest changes in traffic-related mortality risks over time, from 1976-2001, despite the decline in regulated tailpipe emissions per vehicle since the mid-1970s. This suggests that other environmental effects may be involved, such as particles from brake, tire, and road wear, traffic noise, psychological stress, and spatial gradients in socioeconomic status.

The debate was characterized by strong assertions as well as by strong feelings; Unfortunately, those assertions often revealed serious misunderstandings of what has (and has not) been demonstrated by scientific research in this field. Although a great deal is now known, the issues remain complex and in many cases still unresolved. Another unfortunate aspect of the debate was that many participants made little effort to distinguish scientific issues from political ones. Research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications. In such a climate, individuals who wish to make their own judgments find it hard to know what to believe.Reviewing the intelligence debate at its meeting of November 1994, the Board of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) concluded that there was urgent need for an authoritative report on these issues-one that all sides could we as a basis for discussion; Acting by unanimous vote BSA established a Task Force charged with preparing such a report. Ulric Neisser, Professor of Psychology at Emery University and a member of BSA, was appointed Chair The APA Board on the Advancement of Psychology, in the Public Interest, which was consulted extensively during this process, nominated one member of the Task Force, the Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment nominated another, a third was nominated by the Council of Representatives. Other members were chosen by an extended consultative process, with the aim of representing a broad range of expertise and opinion.The Task Force met twice, in January and March of 1995. Between and after these meetings, drafts of the various sections were circulated, revised, and revised yet again. Disputes were resolved by discussion. As a result, the report presented here has the unanimous support of the entire Task Force.

More refined assessment has been limited by study size and available air quality data.Methods: Measurements of 5 pollutants (particulate matter [PM10] ozone, nitrogen dioxide [NO2] carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) were available for the entire study period (I January 1993 to 31 August 2000); detailed measurements of particulate matter were available for 25 months. We obtained data on 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. Visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, and pneumonia were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized estimating equations.Results: In single-pollutant models examining 3-day moving averages of pollutants (lags 0, 1, and 2): standard deviation increases of ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with 1-3% increases in UR1 visits; a 2 mug/m(3) increase of PM2.5 organic carbon was associated with a 3% increase in pneumonia visits; and standard deviation increases of NO2 and CO were associated with 2-3% increases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits. Positive associations persisted beyond 3 days for several of the outcomes, and over a week for asthma.Conclusions: The results of this study contribute to the evidence of an association of several correlated gaseous and particulate pollutants, including ozone, NO2, CO, PM, and organic carbon, with specific respiratory conditions.

In controlled feeding studies, the consumption of diets that contained Hg (as methylmercury) at environmentally realistic concentrations resulted in a range of toxic effects in fish, birds, and mammals, including behavioral, neurochemical, hormonal, and reproductive changes. Limited field-based studies, especially with certain wild piscivorous bird species, e.g., the common loon, corroborated laboratory- based results, demonstrating significant relations between methylmercury exposure and various indicators of methylmercury toxicity, including reproductive impairment. Potential population effects in fish and wildlife resulting from dietary methylmercury exposure are expected to vary as a function of species life history, as well as regional differences in fish-Hg concentrations, which, in turn, are influenced by differences in Hg deposition and environmental methylation rates. However, population modeling suggests that reductions in Hg emissions could have substantial benefits for some common loon populations that are currently experiencing elevated methylmercury exposure. Predicted benefits would be mediated primarily through improved hatching success and development of hatchlings to maturity as Hg concentrations in prey fish decline. Other piscivorous species may also benefit from decreased Hg exposure but have not been as extensively studied as the common loon.

This national cohort is male with an average age at recruitment of 51 +/- 72 yr; 35% were black and 81% had been smokers at one time. Because the subjects have been receiving care at various U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals, access to and quality of medical care are relatively homogeneous. The health endpoints available for analysis include all-cause mortality and specific diagnoses for morbidity during VA hospitalizations; only the mortality results are discussed here. Nonpollution predictor variables in the baseline model include race, smoking (ever or at recruitment), age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and body mass index (BMI). Interactions of BP and BMI with age were also considered. Although this study essentially controls for socioeconomic status by design because of the homogeneity of the cohort, selected ecological variables were also considered at the ZIP code and county levels, some of which were round to be significant predictors. Pollutants were averaged by year and county for TSP, PM10, CO, O-3 and NO2; SO2 and Pb were considered less thoroughly. Both mean and peak levels were considered for gases. SO42- data from the AIRS database and PM2.5, coarse particles, PM15, and SO42- from the U.S. EPA Inhalable Particulate (IP) Network were also considered. Four relevant exposure periods were defined: 1974 and earlier (back to 1953 for TSP), 1975-1981, 1982-1988, and 1989-1996. Deaths during each of the three most recent exposure periods were considered separately, yielding up to 12 combinations of exposure and mortality periods for each pollutant. Associations between concurrent air quality and mortality periods were considered to relate to acute responses; delayed associations with prior exposures were considered to be emblematic of initiation of chronic disease. Preexposure mortality associations were considered to be indirect (noncausal). The implied mortality risks of long-term exposure to air pollution were found to be sensitive to the details of the regression model, the time period of exposure, the locations included, and the inclusion of ecological as well as personal variables. Both positive and negative statistically significant mortality responses were found. Fine particles as measured in the 1979-1984 US. EPA Inhalable Particulate Network indicated no significant (positive) excess mortality risk for this cohort in any of the models considered. Among the positive responses, indications of concurrent mortality risks were seen for NO2 and peak O-3, with a similar indication of delayed risks only for NO2. The mean levels of these excess risks were in the range of 5-9%. Peak O-3 was dominant in two-pollutant models and there was some indication of a threshold in response. However, it is likely that standard errors of the regression coefficients may have been underestimated because of spatial autocorrelation among the model residuals. The significant variability of responses by period of death cohort suggests that aggregation over the entire period of followup obscures important aspects of the implied pollution-mortality relationships, such as early depletion of the available pool of those subjects who may be most susceptible to air pollution effects.

The relationship between BP and air quality is considered by reviewing the literature, by deleting variables from the proportional hazards regression model, and by stratifying the cohort by diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level. The literature review shows BP to be an important predictor of survival and finds small transient associations between air quality and BP that may be either positive or negative. The regression model sensitivity runs showed that the associations with air pollution are robust to the deletion of the BP variables, for the entire cohort. For stratified regressions, the confidence intervals for the air pollution-mortality associations overlap for the two DBP groups. We conclude that associations between mortality and air quality are not mediated through blood pressure, nor vice versa.

Stomach content analysis showed that although large normal individuals feed on different prey than do dwarf individuals, similar methyl mercury levels were found in prey of both forms. We suggest that dwarf individuals bioaccumulate mercury more rapidly than normal specimens because they begin to mature at an earlier age (usually at age 2 to 3 compared to age 6 for normal specimens) and thus produce proportionally less flesh to dilute the mercury assimilated. Total mercury analysis indicating higher concentrations in flesh than in gonads support this hypothesis. Our results suggest that when monitoring mercury levels in fish in areas where populations of dwarf and normal lake whitefish coexist, dwarf and normal specimens must be distinguished because of their different bioaccumulation rates.

The changes in calculated annual mean PM(2.5) concentrations show a relatively modest change with positive and negative responses (increasing PM(2.5) levels across the northeastern U.S.) although average ozone levels slightly decrease across the northern sections of the U.S., and increase across the southern tier. Results suggest that climate change driven air quality-related health effects will be adversely affected in more than 2/3 of the continental U.S. Changes in health effects induced by PM(2.5) dominate compared to those caused by ozone, PM(2.5)-induced premature mortality is about 15 times higher than that due to ozone, Nationally the analysis suggests approximately 4000 additional annual premature deaths due to climate change impacts on PM(2.5) vs 300 due to climate change-induced ozone changes. However, the impacts vary spatially. Increased premature mortality due to elevated ozone concentrations will be offset by lower mortality from reductions in PM(2.5) in 11 states. Uncertainties related to different emissions projections used to simulate future climate, and the uncertainties forecasting the meteorology, are large although there are potentially important unaddressed uncertainties (e.g., downscaling, speciation, interaction, exposure, and concentration-response function of the human health studies).",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP52,,22,An Empirical Bayes Approach to Combining Estimates of the Value of Statistical Life for Environmental Policy Analysis,Environmental and Resource Economics,0924-6460,"Kochi, I; Hubbell, B; Kramer, R",10.1007/s10640-006-9000-8,6-Jul,Georgia State University; US Environmental Protection Agency; Duke University,,"An empirical Bayes pooling method is used to combine and compare estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL).

For the 2,149 patients who visited the ED only, the average visit cost was $234.48. For hospitalized patients, the average length of stay was 3.8 d, and the cost was $3,102.53. Nursing care was the source of the majority of hospital costs for asthma (43.6%), respiratory therapy (13.6%), and medications (10.4%).

We endeavored to estimate the extent to which pregnant women changed fish consumption habits after dissemination of this national advisory.METHODS: We performed interrupted time series analysis of data from a cohort of pregnant women (2235 who completed at least one dietary questionnaire) visiting obstetric offices in a multispecialty group practice in eastern Massachusetts, surveyed before the advisory from April 1999 through December 2000 and after the advisory from April 2001 through February 2002. Main outcome measures were consumption of total fish and of four fish types: canned tuna, dark meat fish, shellfish, and white meat fish. Subjects reported fish consumption on semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires administered at each trimester of pregnancy.RESULTS: We observed diminished consumption of dark meat fish, canned tuna, and white meat fish after the national mercury advisory. These decreases resulted in a reduction in total fish consumption of approximately 1.4 servings per month (95% confidence interval 0.7, 2.0) from December 2000 to April 2001, with ongoing declines through the end of the study period. There was no change in shellfish intake.CONCLUSION: After dissemination of federal recommendations, pregnant women in this cohort reported reduced consumption of fish, including tuna, dark meat fish, and white meat fish. Because these fish may confer nutritional benefits to mother and infant, public health implications of these changes remain unclear.

This study examined the association between both PM(10) and ozone and respiratory hospital admissions for persons 65 yr of age and older in the Detroit, Michigan, metropolitan area during the years 1986 to 1989.

Asthma admissions were not associated with either pollutant. Controlling for one pollutant did not effect the magnitude of the association with the other pollutant.

For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of more than 1 million deaths in 14 U.S. cities. Main results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10-ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% Cl 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months.

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers.Methods: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances.Results: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-mu g/m(3) increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5.Conclusions: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be antici-pated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses.

PM(10) has rarely been used as the particle exposure measure, however. This study examined whether such an association could be seen in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, which has daily monitoring data for PM(10). Data on hospital admissions in persons aged 65 y and older were obtained from Medicare records for the years 1986 through 1989. Daily counts of admissions, by admit date, were computed for pneumonia (ICD9 480-487) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD9 490-496). Classification was by discharge diagnosis. Daily air pollution data from all monitoring stations for ozone and PM(10) in Minneapolis-St. Paul were obtained, and the daily average for each pollutant was computed. An average of approximately six pneumonia admissions and two admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurred each day. Poisson regression analysis was used to control for time trends, seasonal fluctuations, and weather. PM(10) was a risk factor for pneumonia admissions (relative risk [RR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-1.02) and COPD admissions (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 2.06-1.20). Ozone was also associated with pneumonia admissions (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.36-0.97). The relative risks are for an increase of 100 mu g/m(3) in daily PM(10) and 50 ppb in daily ozone concentration. Several alternative methods for controlling for seasonal patterns and weather were used, including nonparametric regression techniques. The results were not sensitive to the methods. When days exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for either pollutant were excluded, the association remained for both pneumonia (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.34-1.03 for PM(10), and RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.41-0.99 for ozone) and COPD (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 2.06-1.16 for PM(10)).

This relationship was examined in two cities with substantially different levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) but similar levels of airborne particles in an attempt to separate the effects of the two pollutants. Significant differences in weather between the two cities allowed the evaluation of that potential confounder also.Methods - Daily counts of admissions to all hospitals for respiratory disease (ICD 9 460-519) were constructed for persons aged 65 years and older in two cities - New Haven, Connecticut and Tacoma, Washington. Each city was analysed separately. Average daily concentrations of SO2, inhalable particles (PM(10)), and ozone were computed from all monitors in each city, and daily average temperature and humidity were obtained from the US weather service. Daily respiratory admission counts were regressed on temperature, humidity, day of the week indicators, and air pollution. A 19 day weighted moving regression filter was used to remove all seasonal and subseasonal patterns from the data. Possible U-shaped dependence of admissions on temperature was dealt with using indicator variables for eight categories each of temperature and humidity. Each pollutant was first examined individually and then multiple pollutant models were fitted.Results - All three pollutants were associated with respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The PM(10) associations were little changed by control for either ozone or SO2. The ozone association was likewise independent of the other pollutants. The SO2 association was substantially attenuated by control for ozone in both cities, and by control for PM(10) in Tacoma. The magnitude of the effect was small (relative risk 1.06 in New Haven and 1.10 in Tacoma for a 50 mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10), for example) but, given the ubiquitous exposure, this has some public health significance.Conclusions - Air pollution concentrations within current guidelines were associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The strongest evidence for an independent association was for PM(10), followed by ozone. These results are consistent with other studies and suggest that lowering air pollution concentrations would have some impact on public health.

In this study, we modeled the monetized damages associated with 407 coal-fired power plants in the United States, focusing on premature mortality from fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). We applied a reduced-form chemistry-transport model accounting for primary PM(2.5) emissions and the influence of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emissions on secondary particulate formation. Outputs were linked with a concentration-response function for PM(2.5)-related mortality that incorporated nonlinearities and model uncertainty. We valued mortality with a value of statistical life approach, characterizing and propagating uncertainties in all model elements. At the median of the plant-specific uncertainty distributions, damages across plants ranged from $30,000 to $500,000 per ton of PM(2.5), $6,000 to $50,000 per ton of SO(2), $500 to $15,000 per ton of NOx, and $0.02 to $1.57 per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Variability in damages per ton of emissions was almost entirely explained by population exposure per unit emissions (intake fraction), which itself was related to atmospheric conditions and the population size at various distances from the power plant. Variability in damages per kilowatt-hour was highly correlated with SO(2) emissions, related to fuel and control technology characteristics, but was also correlated with atmospheric conditions and population size at various distances. Our findings emphasize that control strategies that consider variability in damages across facilities would yield more efficient outcomes.

We linked ambient air pollution data from 151 U.S. metropolitan areas in 1980 with individual risk factor on 552,138 adults who resided in these areas when enrolled in a prospective study in 1982. Deaths were ascertained through December, 1989. Exposure to sulfate and fine particulate air pollution, which is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, was estimated from national data bases. The relationships of air pollution to all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality was examined using multivariate analysis which controlled for smoking, education, and other risk factors. Although small compared with cigarette smoking, an association between mortality and particulate air pollution was observed. Adjusted relative risk ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of all-cause mortality for the most polluted areas compared with the least polluted equaled 1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) and 1.17 (1.09 to 1.26) when using sulfate and fine particulate measures respectively. Particulate air pollution was associated with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality but not with mortality due to other causes. Increased mortality is associated with sulfate and fine particulate air pollution at levels commonly found in U.S. cities. The increase in risk is not attributable to tobacco smoking, although other unmeasured correlates of pollution cannot be excluded with certainty.

In the Harvard Six Cities Diary Study, lower respiratory symptoms in a two-pollutant model were associated with an interquartile range increment in fine particles [(for 15 mu g/m(3) particulate matter (PM) <2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.06, 1.57] but not coarse particles (for 8 mu g/m(3) PM2.5-10, odds ratio = 1.05, 95% CL = 0.90, 1.23).

Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks.Methods. In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities.Results. Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates.Conclusions. Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.

The plausible distribution of the benefits is quite broad with 5th and 95th percentile estimates of approximately $50 million and $3.5 billion, respectively. The largest source of uncertainty is whether epidemiological associations between MeHg exposure and fatal heart attacks reflect causality. The next largest sources of uncertainty concern the slope of the relationship between maternal MeHg exposure and reduced intelligence among children and whether this relationship exhibits a threshold. Our analysis suggests that the possible causal relationship between MeHg exposure and fatal heart attacks should be better characterized, using additional epidemiological studies and formally elicited expert judgment ",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP52,,22,Reduction in fine particulate air pollution and mortality - Extended follow-up of the Harvard six cities study,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Laden, F.; Schwartz, J.; Speizer, F.E.; Dockery, D.W.",10.1164/rccm.200503-443OC,15-Mar-06,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences," Rationale: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95).Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.

We used a two-stage logistic regression model to analyze the data, adjusting Ear the potential confounding effects of sex, history of allergies, parental asthma, parental education, and current smoking in the home. Children living in the community with the highest levels of particle strong acidity were significantly more likely [odds ratio (OR) = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.48] to report at least one episode of bronchitis in the past year compared to children living in the least-polluted community. Fine particulate sulfate was also associated with higher reporting of bronchitis (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.12-2.42). No other respiratory symptoms were significantly higher in association with any of the air pollutants of interest. Na sensitive subgroups were identified. Reported bronchitis, but neither asthma, wheeze, cough, nor phlegm, were associated with levels of particle strong acidity for these children living in a nonurban environment.

Recent attention has focused on the effects of particulate exposure on cardiac autonomic control. Inhaled particulates may affect the autonomic nervous system either directly, by eliciting a sympathetic stress response, or indirectly, through inflammatory cytokines produced in the lungs and released into the, circulation.Methods and Results-This longitudinal study examined the association of particulates less than or equal to2.5 mum in diameter (PM2.5) with heart rate variability (HRV) in an occupational cohort (N = 40). Continuous monitoring of exposure and HR was performed during and away from work. PM2.5 levels were higher than ambient levels typically reported in Boston, 0.167 +/- 3.205 mg/m(3) (geometric mean geometric SD). We found a 2.66% decrease (95% CI, -3.75% to -1.58%) in the 5-minute SD of normal RR intervals (SDNN) for every 1 mg/m(3) increase in the 4-hour moving PM2.5 average and a 1.02% increase (95% CI, 0.59% to 1.46%) in HR after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The decrease in SDNN became larger as the averaging interval increased.Conclusions-Workers experienced altered cardiac autonomic control after exposure to occupational and environmental PM2.5. There appears to be either a long-acting (several hours) and a short-acting (several minutes) component to the mechanism of action that may be related to the production of cytokines and the sympathetic stress response, respectively, or a cumulative effect that begins shortly after exposure begins. The clinical significance of these effects in a healthy working population is unclear.

Hourly concentrations of particle mass (2.5 mum (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period.

Random effects pooled estimates of excess all-cause mortality (single-pollutant models) associated with a change in pollutant concentration equal to the mean value among a representative group of cities were 2.0% (95% Cl 1.5-2.4%) per 31.3 mug/m(3) particulate matter (PM) of median diameter less than or equal to10 mum (PM10); 1.7% (1.2-2.2%) per 1.1 ppm CO; 2.8% (2.1-3.5%) per 24.0 ppb NO2; 1.6% (1.1-2.0%) per 31.2 ppb O-3; and 0.9% (0.7-1.2%) per 9.4 ppb SO2 (daily maximum concentration for O-3, daily average for others). Effect sizes were generally reduced in multipollutant models, but remained significantly different from zero for PM10 and SO2. Larger effect sizes were observed for respiratory mortality for all pollutants except O-3. Heterogeneity among studies was partially accounted for by differences in variability of pollutant concentrations, and results were robust to alternative approaches to selecting estimates from the pool of available candidates.

Our regression analyses, which utilized the actual hair mercury level, did not find significant associations between mercury and children's test scores. However, this finding was highly influenced by a single child whose mother's mercury hair level (86 mg/kg) was more than four times that of any other mother. When that child was omitted, results were more indicative of a mercury effect and scores on six tests were significantly associated with the mothers' hair mercury level. BMDs calculated from five tests ranged from 32 to 73 mg/kg hair mercury, and corresponding BMDLs (95% lower limits on BMDs) ranged from 17 to 24 mg/kg.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.

Because fish intake is a major source of exposure to mercury, the mercury content of fish may counteract the beneficial effects of its n-3 fatty acids.Methods: In a case-control study conducted in eight European countries and Israel, we evaluated the joint association of mercury levels in toenail clippings and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, or DHA) levels in adipose tissue with the risk of a first myocardial infarction among men. The patients were 684 men with a first diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The controls were 724 men selected to be representative of the same populations.Results: The average toenail mercury level in controls was 0.25 microg per gram. After adjustment for the DHA level and coronary risk factors, the mercury levels in the patients were 15 percent higher than those in controls (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 25 percent). The risk-factor-adjusted odds ratio for myocardial infarction associated with the highest as compared with the lowest quintile of mercury was 2.16 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 4.29; P for trend = 0.006).

Criticisms of these reports have focused on the statistical techniques that are used to estimate the pollution-mortality relationship and the inconsistency in findings between cities. We have developed analytical methods that address these concerns and combine evidence from multiple locations to gain a unified analysis of the data. The paper presents log-linear regression analyses of daily time series data from the largest 20 US cities and introduces hierarchical regression models for combining estimates of the pollution-mortality relationship across cities. We illustrate this method by focusing on mortality effects of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter) and by performing univariate and bivariate analyses with PM10 and ozone (O-3) level. In the first stage of the hierarchical model, we estimate the relative mortality rate associated with PM10 for each of the 20 cities by using semiparametric log-linear models. The second stage of the model describes between-city Variation in the true relative rates as a function of selected city-specific covariates. We also fit two Variations of a spatial model with the goal of exploring the spatial correlation of the pollutant-specific coefficients among cities. Finally, to explore the results of considering the two pollutants jointly, we fit and compare univariate and bivariate models. Ail posterior distributions from the second stage are estimated by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In univariate analyses using concurrent day pollution Values to predict mortality, we find that an increase of 10 mug m(-3) in PM10 on average in the USA is associated with a 0.48% increase in mortality (95% interval: 0.05, 0.92). With adjustment for the O-3 level the PM10-coefficient is slightly higher. The results are largely insensitive to the specific choice of vague but proper prior distribution.

In the second stage, we specify a class of distributions for the true city-specific relative rates to estimate an overall effect by taking into account the variability within and across cities. We perform the calculations with respect to several random effects distributions (normal, t-student, and mixture of normal), thus relaxing the common assumption of a two-stage normal-normal hierarchical model. We assess the sensitivity of the results to: (i) lag structure for ozone exposure; (ii) degree of adjustment for long-term trends; (iii) inclusion of other pollutants in the model; (iv) heat waves; (v) random effects distributions; and (vi) prior hyperparameters.On average across cities, we found that a 10ppb increase in summer ozone level over the previous week is associated with a 1.25 per cent increase in CVDRESP mortality (95 per cent posterior regions: 0.47, 2.03). The relative rate estimates are also positive and statistically significant at lags 0, 1 and 2. We found that associations between summer ozone and CVDRESP mortality are sensitive to the confounding adjustment for PM10, but are robust to: (i) the adjustment for long-term trends, other gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 and CO); (ii) the distributional assumptions at the second stage of the hierarchical model; and (iii) the prior distributions on all unknown parameters.Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models and their application to the NMMAPS data allow us to estimate of an acute health effect associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in the last few days on average across several locations. The application of these methods and the systematic assessment of the sensitivity of findings to model assumptions provide important epidemiological evidence for future air quality regulations.

Five frequency-domain measures and three time-domain measures were obtained. The associations between HRV measures and the incidence of new cardiac events (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or congestive heart failure) were assessed with proportional hazards regression analyses. There were 2501 eligible subjects with a mean age of 53 years. During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, cardiac events occurred in 58 subjects. After adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and other relevant risk factors, all HRV measures except the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power were significantly associated with risk for a cardiac event (P=.0016 to .0496). A one-standard deviation decrement in the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals (natural log transformed) was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.47 for new cardiac events (95% confidence interval of 1.16 to 1.86).Conclusions The estimation of HRV by ambulatory monitoring offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.

The formation of the fluid lens generates local and transient oxic-anoxic oscillations following the sedimentation-resuspension tidal cycles under a specific hydrodynamic regime. The total Hg concentration, ranging from 5 to 190 nM, increases with SPM concentration (4-174 g L-1) to a maximum at bottom. Particulate Hg averages 99% of total Hg. Particulate inorganic Hg (IHg(II)(P)) and monomethyl Hg (MMHgP) exhibit a similar trend: the maximum concentration is observed within the upper layer above the depth of 7 m and the minimum at the bottom layers of the fluid mud. Significant levels of ""dissolved"" (i.e. filter passing) Hg species (IHg(II)(D), Hg degrees (D), MMHgD, DMHgD) are observed within the redox transition interface. In the sub/anoxic fluid mud layer, increasing concentrations of IHg(II)(D) and MMHgD coincide with decreasing concentrations of IHg (II)p and MMHgP, respectively. The distribution coefficient (log K-d) between the ""dissolved"" and particulate fraction for IHg(II) averages 4.5 +/- 0.2. A K-d minimum for IHg(II) is observed in the surface layer and at the bottom of the fluid mud and coincides with the maximum levels of dissolved Mn and Fe. Log K-d for MMHg averages 3.3 +/- 0.9 and presents the highest values (4.3-4.6) in the surface and the lowest (similar to2.2) at bottom, corresponding to the particulate carbon profile. These results demonstrate that the fate of IHg(II) and MMHg in the fluid mud system is influenced by the redox cycling of major species such as carbon, Fe, and Mn. It is therefore suggested that the redox oscillations generated by fluid mud formation in the high turbidity zone affect the distribution and transfer of Hg species in macrotidal estuaries.

Does EP harm the economy and destroy jobs or facilitate economic growth and create jobs? We address this issue by summarizing the results of the Jobs and the Environment Initiative, research funded by nonprofit foundations to quantify the relationship between EP, the economy, and jobs. We estimate the size of the US environmental industry and the numbers of environment-related jobs at the national level and in the states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin. This is the first time that such comprehensive, detailed estimates have been developed.Our major finding is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, EP, economic growth, and jobs creation are complementary and compatible: Investments in EP create jobs and displace jobs, but the net effect on employment is positive.Second, environment protection has grown rapidly to become a major sales-generating, job-creating industry-$300 billion/year and 5 million jobs in 2003.Third, most of the 5 million jobs created are standard jobs for accountants, engineers, computer analysts, clerks, factory workers, etc., and the classic environmental job (environmental engineer, ecologist, etc.) constitutes only a small portion of the jobs created. Most of the persons employed in the jobs created may not even realize that they owe their livelihood to protecting the environment.Fourth, Lit the state level, the relationship between environmental policies and economic/job growth is positive, not negative. States can have strong economics and simultaneously protect the environment.Finally, environmental jobs are concentrated in manufacturing and professional, information, scientific, and technical services, and are thus disproportionately the types of jobs all states seek to attract.

We report the results of 122 bioassays in 13 streams of the three study regions: the Adirondack mountains of New York, the Catskill mountains of New York, and the Northern Appalachian Plateau of Pennsylvania. Bioassays during acidic episodes had significantly higher mortality than did bioassays conducted under nonacidic conditions, but there was little difference in mortality rates in bioassays experiencing acidic episodes and those experiencing acidic conditions throughout the test period. Multiple logistic regression models were used to relate bioassay mortality rates to summary statistics of time-varying stream chemistry (inorganic monomeric aluminum, calcium, pH, and dissolved organic carbon) estimated for the 20-d bioassay periods. The large suite of candidate regressors also included biological, regional, and seasonal factors, as well as several statistics summarizing various features of aluminum exposure duration and magnitude. Regressor variable selection and model assessment were complicated by multicollinearity and overdispersion. For the target fish species, brook trout, bioassay mortality was most closely related to time-weighted median inorganic aluminum. Median Ca and minimum pH offered additional explanatory power, as did stream-specific aluminum responses. Due to high multicollinearity, the relative importance of different aluminum exposure duration and magnitude variables was difficult to assess, but these variables taken together added no significant explanatory power to models already containing median aluminum. Between 59 and 79% of the variation in brook trout mortality was explained by models employing between one and five regressors. Simpler models were developed for smaller sets of bioassays that tested slimy and mottled sculpin (Cottus cognatus and C. bairdi) as well as blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus). For these forage species a single inorganic aluminum exposure variable successfully accounted for 86-98% of the observed mortality.

Elemental Hg is formed primarily by reduction of ionic Hg in the mixed layer of aquatic systems. By culturing phytoplankton in defined media, and by incubating natural seawater and freshwater samples, we have demonstrated that Hg-o is produced by microorganisms, with formation rates (0.5 to 10% d(-1)) similar to those estimated from mass balance studies. Our results also suggest that <3 mu m microorganisms are the primary Hg reducers in natural waters. Eucaryotic phytoplankton are capable of reducing ionic Hg to Hg degrees but the rate of reduction is insufficient to account for the observed reduction rates found in incubated field samples. Bacteria are thus the more likely Hg reducers. In seawater, cyanobacteria such as Synecococcus may account for much of the mercury reduction, while in the eutrophic, polluted Upper Mystic Lake north of Boston other procaryotic microorganisms are contributing to the overall Hg reductive capacity of the medium. By reducing ionic Hg, microorganisms play a pivotal role in the aquatic biogeochemistry of Hg, not only by enabling evasion to the atmosphere, but by directly decreasing the amount of ionic Hg available for methylation.

This index was designed to be linear with respect to perceived visual changes over its entire range in a way that is analogous to the decibel scale for sound. Neither visual range nor extinction coefficient have this useful property, which has resulted in their misuse for some applications. By assuming the availability of sensitive scenic targets at every distance, it can be demonstrated that any specific fractional change in extinction coefficient (or visual range) is equally perceptible regardless of baseline visibility conditions. The new index is defined so that its scale, which is expressed in deciview (dnu), is linear with respect to fractional changes in extinction coefficient, b(ext), as 10 ln(b(ext)/0.01 km-1), where extinction coefficient is expressed in km-1. A 1 dnu change is about a 10% change in extinction coefficient, which is a small but perceptible scenic change under many circumstances. Since the deciview scale is near zero for a pristine atmosphere (dnu = 0 for Rayleigh conditions at about 1.8 km elevation) and increases as visibility is degraded, it measures perceived haziness. Use of the deciview scale in visibility perception and benefits research will promote improved study design and more appropriate use of results. It should also allow the visibility consequences of alternative air pollution-related decisions to be more easily presented and evaluated.

Using a clustering approach, model performance was examined separately for several different synoptic regimes. Under the most common synoptic conditions of a typical summertime Bermuda High setup, the model showed good overall performance for O(3), while associations have been identified here between other, less frequent, synoptic regimes and the O(3) overprediction and underprediction biases. A sensitivity test between the CB-1V and CB05 chemical mechanisms showed that predictions of daily maximum 8-h average O(3) using CB05 were on average 7.3% higher than those using CB-IV. Boundary condition (BC) sensitivity tests show that the overprediction biases at low O(3) levels are more sensitive to the BC 03 levels near the surface than BC concentrations aloft. These sensitivity tests also show the model performance for O(3) improved when using the global GEOS-CHEM BCs instead of default profiles. Simulations using the newest version of the CMAQ model (v4.6) showed a small improvement in O(3) predictions, particularly when vertical layers were not collapsed.

At that time, the committee concluded that neurodevelopmental toxicity was the most sensitive endpoint but recognized emerging evidence of potential cardiovascular effects at low levels of exposure. The committee recommended that these potential effects be addressed through the uncertainty factors applied to the development of the neurodevelopmental reference dose (RID). This approach was adopted by the US EPA in its derivation of the methylmercury RfD. Since that time, additional studies have become available. The available studies addressing the broad categories of heart disease (including myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic heart disease), hypertension, and heart rate variability are critically reviewed here. Overall, the evidence linking realistic rates of MeHg exposure from fish consumption to cardiovascular disease suggests an association with heart disease, particularly MI. The apparent antagonistic interaction of MeHg and n-3 fatty acids contained in fish suggests a causal mechanism. As different individuals and populations characteristically consume different species of fish, the risk of cardiovascular effects may not be a simple function of MeHg exposure but its assessment may well need to take n-3 fatty acid intake into account also. The case for significant adverse effects of MeHg on blood pressure at current levels of exposure is weaker. This effect, observed in childhood, does not appear to persist into adolescence, and animal studies are difficult to interpret given the high doses employed. The decrease in heart rate variability related to fetal exposure to MeHg in the same cohort appears to persist into early adolescence and may reflect developmental neurophysiological alterations that are consistent with the developmental neuropsychological effects also observed in that cohort. However, the cardiovascular significance of this effect with regard to its direct effect on health or its ability to predict other, more direct, health effects is unclear. At present, the studies of the Finnish cohort relating MeHg exposure to acute MI and coronary heart disease appear to provide the strongest basis for a formal quantitative risk assessment of the cardiovascular effects of MeHg.

This requires a ratio relating cord blood Hg concentration to maternal blood Hg concentration. No formal analysis of either the central tendency or variability of this ratio has been done. This variability contributes to the overall variability in the dose estimate. A ratio of 1.0 is implicitly used in the model, but an uncertainty factor adjustment is applied to the central tendency estimate of dose to address variability in that estimate. Thus, incorporation of the cord:maternal ratio and its variability into the estimate of intake dose could result in a significant change in the value of the RED. We analyzed studies providing data on the cord:maternal blood Hg ratio and conducted a Monte Carlo-based meta-analysis of 10 studies meeting all inclusion criteria to generate a comprehensive estimate of the central tendency and variabdity of the ratio. This analysis results in a recommended central tendency estimate of 1.7, a coefficient of variation of 0.56, and a 95th percentile of 3.4. By analogy to the impact of the similar hair:blood Hg ratio on the overall variability in the dose estimate, incorporation of the cord:maternal ratio may support a 3-fold uncertainty factor adjustment to the central tendency estimate of dose to account for pharmacokinetic variability. Whether the information generated in this analysis is sufficient to warrant a revision to the RED will depend on the outcome of a comprehensive reanalysis of the entire one-compartment model.

Adjusting for the funnel plot asymmetry resulted in a slightly reduced estimate (0.35%; 0.23-0.47%). In a subset for which particulate matter (PM) data were available (15 studies), the corresponding estimates were 0.40% (0.27-0.53%) for ozone alone and 0.37% (0.20-0.54%) with PM in model. The estimates for warm seasons were generally larger than those for cold seasons. Our additional time-series analysis found that including PM in the model did not substantially reduce the ozone risk estimates. However, the difference in the weather adjustment model could result in a 2-fold difference in risk estimates (eg, 0.24% to 0.49% in multicity combined estimates across alternative weather models for the ozone-only all-year case).Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest short-term associations between ozone and daily mortality in the majority of the cities, although the estimates appear to be heterogeneous across cities.

The logic also offers a series of potentially observable ""predictions"" that can be used to gauge the plausibility of benefit transfers. When multiple benefit estimates from different methods are available such as hedonic property value, travel cost demand, and contingent valuation, the framework uses the definition of the benefit concept from each method in a single preference function to reconcile differences. It provides a specific way to take account of baseline conditions and scope effects (i.e., the size of the proposed change) consistently in the transfer. The method is illustrated using estimates for benefit measure changes in water quality from three studies: travel cost demand, hedonic property value, and contingent valuation analysis.

A bioeconomic model was developed to estimate the economic impacts of leafy spurge on grazing land and wildland in a four-state region (Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming). Leafy spurge infestations on grazing land were estimated to result in a loss in regional grazing capacity sufficient to support a herd of 90,000 cows. Direct economic impacts on stock growers, landowners, and agribusiness firms were estimated to exceed $37 million annually, whereas secondary impacts throughout the regional economy totaled almost $83 million. Impacts on wildland were smaller but still substantial. Study results indicated the serious nature of the leafy spurge problem in the northern Great Plains region and helped to justify enhanced Control efforts.

Long-term soils data suggest that soil acidification has occurred in some spruce stands over the past 50 yr, with plant uptake and cation leaching both contributing to the loss of cations. Studies of tree ring chemistry also have indicated changes in Ca/Al and Mg/Al ratios in red spruce wood, suggesting increases in the ionic strength of soil solution. Irrigation studies using strong acid inputs have demonstrated accelerated displacement of base cations from upper horizons. Spruce-fir (Abies spp.) nutrient budgets indicate that current net Ca and Mg leaching loss rates are of the same order of magnitude as losses to whole tree harvest removals, spread out over a 50-yr rotation. For most cations, red spruce foliar nutrient levels decline with elevation, but it is difficult to assess the contribution of the elevational gradient in atmospheric deposition to this pattern. Compared to northeastern sites, spruce-fir soil solutions in the southern Appalachians have higher nitrate levels and higher Al concentrations, which at times approach the Al toxicity threshold for red spruce seedlings and frequently are at levels known to interfere with cation uptake. There is little evidence that either nutrient deficiencies or Al toxicity are primary causes of red spruce decline in the Northeast, though both may play a role in the Southeast. Major factors that could affect soil chemistry in spruce-fir stands in the future are (i) changes in S and N deposition, (ii) climate changes affecting soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient uptake, and (iii) tree mortality and physical disturbances to soils resulting in soil nitrate release.

The water-soluble compounds of Hg that exist in flue gases (termed reactive gaseous mercury, RGM) are subject to far greater local removal rates than is elemental Hg vapor, but few ambient air data exist. We developed a method using refluxing mist chambers to quantify the airborne concentrations of RGM in more than 250 similar to 1-h samples under ambient conditions and summarize here the results of several RGM sampling campaigns in Tennessee and Indiana from 1992 to 1995. Measured levels of RGM were generally on the order of 50-200 pg/m(3), representing about 3% of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and generally exceeding regional particulate Hg concentrations. RGM exhibits significant correlations (p < 0.05) with temperature, solar radiation, O-3, SO2, and TGM, suggesting seasonal trends similar to those of other regional air pollutants. The concentrations of RGM show reproducible diel trends, peaking during midday and decreasing sharply at night. A sharp spike in RGM was measured during a local plume impaction event in Tennessee. Concentration gradients over vegetation suggested a strong ground-level sink for RGM, and RGM concentrations decreased sharply during rain events, as expected for a water-soluble gas. The levels of RGM measured here support the hypothesis that Hg dry and wet deposition may be strongly influenced by the behavior of RGM and that elevated ecosystem exposure may be possible near major point sources of RGM compounds.

We exposed ferric iron salt-spiked fresh surface lake water (Whitefish Bay, Lake Superior, MI) in Teflon bottles and pond water (Oak Ridge, TN) in quartz bottles to sunlight in the field to infer if sunlight and Fe(III)-induced photochemical production of DGM could mechanistically contribute partly to natural photochemical production of DGM in freshwaters. We found that exposure of freshwater spiked with fresh Fe(III) (similar to5 or 10 muM) to sunlight led to repeatable, significantly larger increases in DGM production (e.g., 380% in 1 h, 420% in 2 h, and 470% in 4 h for Whitefish Bay water) than exposure without the spike (e.g., 200% in 6 h). DGM increased with increasing exposure time and then often appeared to approach a steady slate in the tests. Higher Fe(III) spike levels resulted in the same, or even less, DGM production. Storage of the water with or without Fe(III) spike in the dark after sunlight exposure led to significant, apparently first-order, decreases in DGM. These phenomena were hypothetically attributed to sunlight-induced photochemical production of highly reducing organic free radicals through photolysis of Fe(III)-organic acid coordination compounds and subsequent reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(O) by the organic free radicals; the reduction was also accompanied by dark oxidation of Hg(O) by photochemically originated oxidants (e.g.,(OH)-O-.). This study suggests that sunlight and Fe(III)-induced photochemical reduction of Hg(II)could be one of the mechanisms responsible far natural photochemical production of DGM in freshwaters and that Fe species may be influential in mediating Hg chemodynamics and its subsequent toxicity in aquatic ecosystems.

Because of the increased risks associated with exposures during prenatal and early postnatal development, biomarker results must be interpreted with regard to the age-dependent susceptibility. The authors compared regression coefficients for five sets of exposure biomarkers in 917 children from the Faroe Islands examined at birth, 1 year, and 7 years. Outcome variables were the results of neuropsychologic examination carried out in 1993-1994 at age 7 years. After adjustment for covariates, the cord-blood concentration showed the dearest associations with deficits in language, attention, and memory. Fine-motor function deficits were particularly associated with the maternal hair mercury at parturition. Mercury concentrations in the child's blood and hair at age 7 years were significant predictors only of performance on memory for visuospatial information. These findings emphasize the usefulness of the cord-blood mercury concentration as a main risk indicator. They also support the notion that the greatest susceptibility to methylmercury neurotoxicity occurs during late gestation, while early postnatal vulnerability is less, and they suggest that the time-dependent susceptibility may vary for different brain functions.

The purpose of this article is to develop four ideas that are currently emerging from the work of a diverse group of plant scientists. (1) Air pollution definitions: The definition of air pollution has been broadened, and research activities are expanding to include analysis of plant responses to a wide range of atmospheric chemicals emitted from anthropogenic sources but not previously considered as air pollutants. Thus experiments with CO2 and other trace gases are being pursued with approaches developed in air pollution research. (2) Air pollution uptake: Efforts are increasing to better quantify air pollution absorption rates through stomata in order to calculate actual dose vs, plant responses. The flux rates of gaseous pollutants into leaves, especially O-3, are largely dependent upon stomatal conductance. Approaches are being developed to calculate stomatal absorption of gaseous pollutants, based on stomatal conductance values for water vapor and ambient air-pollution concentrations. Calculation of air pollution absorption rates will allow responses of plants to pollutants to be assessed in toxicological frameworks and will help characterize the strength of vegetation as sinks for some gaseous pollutants. (3) Compensatory responses: Plant responses to air pollutants can be interpreted as compensatory, i.e., a physiological adjustment to an environmental stress that maximizes productivity above that which would have occurred in the absence of compensation. Examples of compensatory responses to air pollutants are shifts in root-to-shoot ratio and accelerated rates of leaf maturation. Recognition of compensatory responses to air pollutants allows these responses to be placed in a framework that relates to whole-plant processes and ecosystem functions. (4) Air pollution and multiple stresses: Air pollution stress seldom occurs in isolation, and research approaches are being developed around the concept of multiple interacting stresses. Multiple-stress experiments are important because factors such as plant water status, light, and nutrient availability are known to alter plant responses to air pollutants. Multiple-stress studies will involve experiments with model plant species and high degrees of environmental control and monitoring.

Nonetheless we still have an incomplete understanding of the factors that control the bioconcentration of mercury. Elemental mercury is efficiently transported as a gas around the globe, and even remote areas show evidence of mercury pollution originating from industrial sources such as power plants. Besides elemental mercury, the major forms of mercury in water are ionic mercury (which is bound to chloride, sulfide, or organic acids) and organic mercury, particularly methylmercury. Methylmercury rather than inorganic mercury is bioconcentrated because it is better retained by organisms at various levels in the food chain. The key factor determining the concentration of mercury in the biota is the methylmercury concentration in water, which is controlled by the relative efficiency of the methylation and demethylation processes. Anoxic waters and sediments are an important source of methylmercury, apparently as the result of the methylating activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. In surface waters, methylmercury may originate from anoxic layers or be formed through poorly known biological or chemical processes. Demethylation is effected both photochemically and biologically.

In general, atmospheric deposition is the primary source of Hg to the watershed in the absence of point source discharges or mineral contributions. The majority of the Hg deposited from the atmosphere to the watershed is retained by the soils. The flux of Hg from the atmosphere to the watershed of Onondaga Lake is estimated at 20-30 mu g . m(-2). yr(-1), based on measurements of Hg deposition in urbanized regions of the United States and Europe. Watershed specific yield from three of the four tributaries that feed Onondaga Lake ranges from 5.3 to 7.5 mu g . m(-2). yr(-1). These watershed Hg export rates are higher than those observed for forested areas and represent approximately 25 percent of the estimated deposition to this urban location. The Hg-T specific yield from the fourth tributary, Ninemile Creek, was substantially higher. This creek had the highest suspended solids loading and receives runoff from an inactive chloralkali plant site. A summertime buildup of Hg species was observed in the hypolimnion of this thermally stratified lake (Jacobs et al., 1995). Sediment trap collections indicated that particle settling facilitates the accumulation of Hg in the hypolimnion. The sources of CH3Hg to the hypolimnion include tributary input and in situ bacterially mediated methylation. The impact of the entrainment of Hg-rich hypolimnetic water following fall destratification on the bioaccumulation of CH3Hg was not clear, because plankton CH3Hg levels were not generally higher following fall overturn.

In contrast, for those rules that use economic incentives, unit costs are consistently overestimated. The difference between the total-cost and the unit-cost results is caused by frequent errors in estimates of the effects of individual rules, which suggests, in turn, that the rule's benefits may also be overestimated. The quantity errors are driven both by difficulties in determining the baseline and by incomplete compliance.

Regional information on electricity supply and use by region is also incorporated. A relatively simple model is developed which yields estimates of the relative burdens within the manufacturing sector of alternative carbon policies. Overall, the principal conclusion is that within the manufacturing sector (which by definition excludes coal production and electricity generation), only a small number of industries would bear a disproportionate short-term burden of a carbon tax or similar policy.

We tested this hypothesis in two ecosystems in New Jersey: Berry's Creek in the Meadowlands (ML) and Pine Barren (PB) lakes.

In contrast, the microbial community of PB was not adapted to mercury and demonstrated low rates of oxidative demethylation (k(deg) = 0.01 day(-1)). These results strongly support our hypothesis and show that the degradation of MeHg by mer-encoded enzymes by the water column microbiota of contaminated environments can significantly affect the amount of MeHg that is available for entry into the aquatic food web.

The results show that in contrast to the expected methylmercury profile typically observed in unmixed sediments, methylmercury production occurs throughout the estimated 15-cm-thick active surface layer of these well-mixed sediments. The resulting large reservoir of methylmercury in these sediments helps to explain why mercury concentrations in organisms in this system remain high despite emissions reductions.

There were also associations between black smoke and angina (P=0.02), NO2 and arrhythmia (P=0.04), and CO and other circulatory diseases (P=0.004), but none with heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction was the only diagnosis for which there were significant associations with and without adjustment for cyclical terms. The associations with acute myocardial infarction were significant only in the cool season.Conclusion-Population data were consistent with 1 in 50 heart attacks currently presenting at London hospitals being triggered by outdoor air pollution. Further research is now needed to investigate whether background concentrations of black smoke, NO2, CO, and SO2 are a preventable cause of myocardial infarction. These results, if applied to all myocardial infarctions in the United Kingdom, indicate a potential saving of 6000 heart attacks a year.

Both Black and White men and women aged 45-64 years from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (n = 9,267) were followed from 1987 to 1997 for myocardial infarction (n = 296), fatal CHD (n = 63), and non-CHD mortality (n = 533). HRV indices and mean R-R interval length (inverse of heart rate) were measured in the supine and standing positions for 2 minutes each; HRV shift was calculated as the difference between positions. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and medication use, HRV in each position was significantly inversely related to events in Cox proportional hazards models. With the exception of R-R interval length shift and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.98 for the smallest vs. the largest quartile), there was no association between HRV shift and the other events. Despite clinical research suggesting that HRV shift with standing is a more sensitive measure of autonomic balance than is HRV in one position, simple measures such as heart rate change and supine and standing HRV were better predictors of events.

We compare new estimates of the benefits and costs of Title IV to those made in 1990. Important changes in our understanding of and ability to quantify the benefits of Title IV have occurred. Benefits to human health now take a much higher profile because the contribution of SO2 and NOx emissions to the formation of fine particulate (PM2.5) is substantial, and evidence of the harmful human health effects Of PM2.5 has emerged in the last 15 years. New estimates of the health benefits Of PM2.5 reductions are the largest category of quantified health and environmental benefits and total over US$100 billion annually for 2010 when the program is expected to be fully implemented. Although important uncertainties exist in any specific estimate of the benefits, even if the estimates were calculated using more limiting assumptions and interpretations of the literature they would still substantially exceed the costs. Estimates of annualized costs for 20 10 are about US$3 billion, which is less than half of what was estimated in 1990. Research since 1990 also suggests that environmental problems associated with acid deposition and nitrogen deposition are more challenging to resolve than originally thought and will require larger reductions in emissions to reverse. The greater than expected benefits to human health, the greater vulnerability of natural resources and ecosystems, and the lower than expected costs all point to the conclusion that further reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants beyond those currently required by Title IV are warranted.

In lab experiments, halides (Cl, Br, 1) were used as competing ligands to determine the strength of CH3Hg+ binding to solid-phase soil organic carbon (SOC) and to dissolved soil organic carbon (DOC) as a function of time, pH, and concentration of halide. Experiments were conducted with native concentrations of CH3Hg (1.7-9.8 ng g(-1)) in organic soils, and equilibrium concentrations of CH3Hg were determined by species-specific-isotope-dilution (SSID) gas-chromatographyinduced-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS). A simple model (RS- + CH3Hg+ = CH3HgSR; log K-CH3HgSR) was used to simulate the binding to SOC and DOC, in which the binding sites (RSH) were independently determined by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The pK(a) values of RSH groups were fixed at 8.50 and 9.95, reflecting the two major thiol groups in proteins. Log K-CH3HgSR values determined for SOC and DOC were similar, showing a range of 15.6-17.1 for all experiments covering a pH range of 2.0-5.1. Despite large differences in affinities between Cl, Br, and I for CH3Hg+, determined constants were independent of type and concentration of halide used in the experiments (log KCH3HgSR = 16.1-16.7 at pH 3.5-3.6).

Because of detailed data available for Onondaga Lake, the RMCM was effectively calibrated. Model predictions of water column and fish concentrations of Hg generally agreed with measured values. The model underestimated concentrations of Hg in sediments. Mass balance calculations show that inputs of Hg-T largely originate from tributary and wastewater inflows to the lake. In contrast, MeHg is largely derived from internal production.

Because of the potential linkage between fish Hg and surface water acidification, factors regulating water column concentrations and bioavailability of Hg were investigated in Adirondack lakes through a field study and application of the Mercury Cycling Model (MCM). Concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg were highly variable, with concentrations of total MeHg about 10% of total Hg in lakes which did not show anoxic conditions. In lakes exhibiting anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, concentrations of total MeHg were elevated. Concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg increased with decreasing pH in remote Adirondack lakes. However, more importantly, concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg increased with increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and percent near-shore wetlands in the drainage basin. Mercury concentrations in muscle tissue of yellow perch from Adirondack lakes were elevated above the U.S. FDA action level (1 mu g/g Hg) in 7% of the fish sampled or in one or more individual fish from 9 of the 16 lakes sampled. Fish Hg concentrations generally increased with increasing fish length, weight and age. Patterns of increasing Hg concentration with age likely reflect shifts in prey of yellow perch and the bioconcentration of Hg along the food chain. For age 3 to 5 perch, concentrations of Hg increased with increasing concentrations of DOC and percent near-shore wetlands in the drainage basin. However, for a lake with very high DOC concentrations, fish concentrations of Hg declined. Calculations with the MCM also show that concentrations of Hg species increase with increasing DOC due to complexation reactions. Increases in DOC result in increasing concentrations of Hg in biota but decreases in the bioconcentration factor of Hg in fish tissue. This research suggests that DOC is important in the transport of Hg to lake systems. High concentrations of DOC may complex MeHg, diminishing its bioavailability. At high concentrations of monomeric Al, the complexation of MeHg with DOC apparently decreases, enhancing the bioavailability of MeHg.

Our previous research in natural sediments has Suggested that Hg methylation occurs most rapidly when sulfide concentrations favor formation of neutral dissolved Hg-S species. In this study, the chemical speciation of Hg in culture media was manipulated by growing D, propionicus across a range of sulfide concentrations, with inorganic Hg (Hg-1) added in the form of ground ores. A solid-phase, rather than a dissolved source of Hg, was used to simulate the controls on Hg partitioning between solid and aqueous phases found in natural sediments. Methylmercury (MeHg) production by cultures was not related to the absolute solid-phase concentration of Hg in the ores, and it was only weakly related to the dissolved Hg-1 concentration in the medium. However, MeHg production was linearly related to the calculated concentration of the dominant neutral complex in solution, HgS degrees. Furthermore, the diffusive membrane permeability of HgS degrees, as estimated from its octanol-water partitioning coefficient, was found to be sufficient to support MeHg production by cells. The present paper expands on our previous work by providing experimental support of our hypothesis that sulfide influences methylation by affecting the speciation of dissolved Hg-1 and its uptake via passive diffusion.

The purpose of the model was to explain observed relationships between pore water sulfide, dissolved inorganic Hg (Hg-D), and bulk methylmercury(MeHg) in surficial sediments of two biogeochemically different ecosystems, the Florida Everglades and Patuxent River, MD. The model was constructed to test the hypothesis that the availability of Hg for methylation in sediments is a function of the concentration of neutral dissolved Hg complexes rather than Hg2+ or total Hg-D. The model included interaction of mercury with solids containing one or two sulfide groups, and it was able to reproduce observed Hg-D and bulk MeHg trends in the two ecosystems. The model is consistent with HgS0 as the dominant neutral Hg complex and the form of Hg accumulated by methylating bacteria in sulfidic pore waters. The model-estimated decline in HgS0 with increasing sulfide was consistent with the observed decline in bulk sediments MeHg. Since bacterial Hg uptake rate is one of the factors affecting methylation rate, Hg complexation models such as the one presented are helpful in understanding the factors that control MeHg production and accumulation in aquatic ecosystems.

The sites examined constitute a trophic gradient, generated from agricultural runoff, across the Everglades Nutrient Removal (ENR) Area, which is a re-constructed wetland, and Water Conservation Areas (WCA) 2A, 2B and 3 in the northern Everglades. MeHg concentrations and %MeHg (MeHg as a percent of total Hg) were lowest in the more eutrophic areas and highest in the more pristine areas in the south. MeHg concentrations ranged from <0.1 ng gdw(-1) sediment in the ENR to 5 ng gdw(-1) in WCA3 sediments; and MeHg constituted <0.2% of total Hg (Hg-T) in ENR, but up to about 2% in two sites in WCA2B and WCA3. Methylation rates in surficial sediments, estimated using tracer-level injections of Hg-203(II) into intact sediment cores, ranged from 0 to 0.12 d(-1), or about 1 to 10 ng g(-1) d(-1) when the per day values are multiplied by the ambient total Hg concentration. Methylation was generally maximal at or within centimeters of the sediment surface, and was never observed in water overlying cores. The spatial pattern of MeHg production generally matched that of MeHg concentration. The coincident distributions of MeHg and its production suggest that in situ production controls concentration, and that MeHg concentration can be used as an analog for MeHg production. In addition, the spatial pattern of MeHg in Everglades sediments matches that in biota, suggesting that MeHg bioaccumulation may be predominantly a function of the de novo methylation rate in surficial sediments.Sulfate concentrations in surficial pore waters (up to 400 mu m), microbial sulfate-reduction rates (up to 800 nm cc(-1) d(-1)) and resultant pore water sulfide concentrations (up to 300 mu m) at the eutrophic northern sites were all high relative to most freshwater systems. All declined to the south, and sulfate concentrations in WCA2B and in central WCA3 resembled those in oligotrophic lakes (50-100 mu m). MeHg concentration and production were inversely related to sulfate reduction rate and pore water sulfide. Control of MeHg production in the northern Everglades appears to mimic that in an estuary, where sulfate concentrations are high and where sulfide produced by microbial sulfate reduction inhibits MeHg production.

Reproductive success of swallows nesting within 50 m of this river was compared to that of three uncontaminated reference tributaries in 2005 and 2006. Female swallows on the contaminated stretch of river had significantly elevated blood and feather total mercury (blood: 3.56 +/- 2.41 ppm ww vs. 0.17 +/- 0.15 ppm reference; feather: 13.55 +/- 6.94 ppm vs. 2.34 +/- 0.87 ppm reference), possibly the highest ever reported for an insectivorous songbird. Insects collected by the swallows to be fed to nestlings averaged 0.97 +/- 1.11 ppm dw total mercury, significantly higher than on reference sites. Swallows in the contaminated area produced fewer fledglings than those in reference areas. The effect of mercury contamination on productivity was detectable only for young females in the contaminated area that were breeding for the first time in 2006, a segment of the population that may already have been stressed by inexperience. Tree swallows served as practical and effective biomonitors for mercury levels and effects and have great potential as proxy biomonitors for more logistically challenging birds such as loons or eagles.

The acute phase of coronary artery disease (CAD) is dramatic and receives much attention because of its high mortality and associated treatment cost. However, the acute phase Typically resolves within 30 days whereas CAD is a chronic disease, which most patients will Live with for mare than a decade. We compared the clinical and economic burden of CAD during the acute phase (first 30 days) with that in The postacute phase (31st day through 10 years).METHODS. We included acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with significant CAD receiving an initial cardiac catheterization at Duke University Medical Center between 1986 and 1997 with follow-up continuing through 1998. Inpatient medical costs were estimated from ACS clinical trial and economic study data. Costs were adjusted to 1997 values and discounted at 3% per annum.RESULTS. Our study included 9,876 ACS patients (5,557 with an acute myocardial infarction [MI] anal 4,319 with unstable angina [UA]). Acute MI patients had higher 30-day mortality than UA patients (5.6% vs. 2.3%, P <0.001). In addition, acute MI and UA patients had significant 10-year unadjusted and adjusted survival differences (both P <0.001). For patients who survived to 30 days, there was no difference in 10-year survival between acute MI and UA patients before adjustment (P = 0.472). After adjustment, however, unstable angina patients who survived to 30 days had greater survival than myocardial infarction patients (P = 0.011). Mean 10-year discounted ACS inpatient medical costs were $45,253 ($23,510 acute phase and $21,819 postacute phase, P = 0.002). Ten year costs for unstable angina patients were $46,423 ($21,824 acute phase and $24,599 postacute phase, P = 0.003); ten year costs for myocardial infarction patients were $44,663 ($24,823 acute phase and $19,840 postacute phase, P <0.001).CONCLUSIONS. We found that the clinical and economic burden of CAD continues long after a patient's acute event has resolved and that postacute CAD cardiac event rates and inpatient medical costs may be higher than previously estimated. With much of all medical costs occurring in the postacute phase, the potential for effective secondary prevention therapies is substantial.

The reduced carbon storage would then require further reductions in fossil fuel emissions to meet a given CO2 concentration target, thereby increasing the cost of meeting the target. Simulations with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) for the historical period (1860-1995) show the largest damages occur in the Southeast and Midwestern regions of the United States, eastern Europe, and eastern China. The largest reductions in carbon storage for the period 1950-1995, 41%, occur in eastern Europe. Scenarios for the 21st century developed with the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM) lead to even greater negative effects on carbon storage in the future. In some regions, current land carbon sinks become carbon sources, and this change leads to carbon sequestration decreases of up to 0.4 Pg C yr(-1) due to damage in some regional ozone hot spots. With a climate policy, failing to consider the effects of ozone damage on carbon sequestration would raise the global costs over the next century of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations Of CO2 equivalents at 550 ppm by 6 to 21 %. Because stabilization at 550 ppm will reduce emission of other gases that cause ozone, these additional benefits are estimated to be between 5 and 25% of the cost of the climate policy. Tropospheric ozone effects on terrestrial ecosystems thus produce a surprisingly large feedback in estimating climate policy costs that, heretofore, has not been included in cost estimates.

For the first time, it was possible to monitor opposite processes like Hg2+ methylation and (CHHg+)-Hg-3 demethylation at ambient tracer levels simultaneously in the same sample. A scheme for calculating the formation of new species from stable tracers used in environmental studies is presented. The sensitivity of stable tracer methods is superior to traditional tracer or radiotracer techniques. In case of mercury methylation, where the generation of a new compound is monitored, the limit of detection depends only on the precision of the isotope ratio measurements and the concentration of the ambient (CHHg+)-Hg-3 already present in the sample, not on the absolute detection limit of the GC/ICP-MS technique used for analyzing CH3Hg+. A 0.25% change in concentration of CH3Hg+ is detectable. In the case of CH3Hg+ demethylation, where the decrease of the added tracer is monitored, the detection limit again depends on the precision of the isotope ratio measurement and the ambient CH3Hg+ concentration but additionally on the amount of the added tracer as well.

The degradation of tracer and ambient methylmercury proceeded at a similar rate, showing no significant differences between added tracer and ambient methylmercury. The calculated half-life for methylmercury in sediments was 1.7 d, suggesting a rapid turnover and low persistence of methylmercury in lake sediments.

Within a few months, approximately 66% of the applied Hg-202 remained associated with above ground vegetation, with the rest being incorporated into soils. The fraction of 202Hg bound to vegetation was much higher than seen for native Hg (<5% vegetation), suggesting that atmospherically derived mercury enters the soil pool with a time delay, after plants senesce and decompose. The initial mobility of mercury received through small rain events or dry deposition decreased markedly in a relatively short time period, suggesting that mercury levels in terrestrial runoff may respond slowly to changes in mercury deposition rates.

Their infants (n = 72) were assessed at age 2 1/2 years.Interventions: Fish oil (2.2 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 1.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/day) or olive oil from 20 weeks' gestation until delivery.Outcome measures: Effects on infant growth and developmental quotients (Griffiths Mental Development Scales), receptive language (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) and behaviour (Child Behaviour Checklist).Results: Children in the fish oil-supplemented group (n = 33) attained a significantly higher Score for eye and hand coordination (mean ((SD) score 114 (10.2)) than those in the placebo group in 39, mean score 108 (SD 11.3); p = 0.021, adjusted p 0.008). Eye and hand coordination scores correlated with n-3 PUFA levels in cord blood erythrocytes (EPA: r = 0.320, p = 0.007; DHA: r = 0.308, p = 0.009) and inversely correlated with n-6 PUFA (arachidonic acid 20:4n-6: r = -0.331, p = 0.005). Growth measurements in the two groups were similar at age 2 1/2 years.Conclusion: Maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy is safe for the fetus and infant, and may have potentially beneficial effects on the child's eye and hand coordination. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of this finding.

We conducted two cruises in 1998 to identify spatial and temporal patterns in Hg-o levels in these systems and performed field and laboratory experiments on redox transformations of Hg. Elemental Hg concentrations were higher in Lake Ontario than in the St. Lawrence River. At stations in Lake Ontario, Hg-o levels were higher at the bottom of the water column than at the surface, whereas they were homogeneous throughout the water column of the river. Elemental Hg concentrations were generally higher in July than in September and, in contrast with experiments on inland lakes, were relatively constant during the day except for a narrow peak at sunrise. Field and laboratory experiments showed that photoreduction of Hg(II) in St. Lawrence River water was substrate limited and was influenced by visible and ultraviolet radiation.

Here we report the results of laboratory and field experiments designed to identify the parameters that control the photooxidation of Hg(0)(aq) and to assess the possible importance of this process in aquatic systems. The concentrations of elemental and total Hg were measured as a function of lime in both artificial and natural waters irradiated with a UV-B lamp. No change in Hg speciation was observed in dark controls, while a significant decrease in Hg(0) was observed in UV-B irradiated artificial solutions containing both chloride ions and benzoquinone. Significant photooxidation rates were also measured in natural samples spiked with Hg(0)(aq); the photooxidation of Hg(0) then follows pseudo first-order kinetics (k = 0.6 h(-1)). These results indicate that the previously observed Hg(II) photoreduction rates in natural waters could represent a net balance between Hg(II) photoreduction and Hg(0) photooxidation. As calculated from Hg(0) photooxidation rates, the dominant Hg(0) sink is likely to be photooxidation rather than volatilization from the water column during summer days.

The estimated fluxes of MeHg and THg in throughfall plus litterfall below the forest canopy were 2 and 3 times greater than annual fluxes by direct wet deposition of MeHg (0.9 mg of MeHg ha(-1)) and THg (71 mg of THg ha(-1)). Almost all of the increased flux of MeHg and THg under the forest canopy occurred as litterfall (0.14-1.3 mg of MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 110-220 mg of THg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Throughfall added no MeHg and approximately 9 mg of THg ha(-1) yr(-1) to wet deposition at ELA, unlike in other regions of the world where atmospheric deposition was more heavily contaminated. These data suggest that dry deposition of Hg on foliage as an aerosol or reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) species is low at ELA, a finding supported by preliminary measurements of RGM there. Annual total deposition from throughfall and litterfall under a fire-regenerated 19-yr-old jack pine/birch forest was 1.7 mg of MeHg ha(-1) and 200 mg of THg ha(-1). We found that average annual accumulation of MeHg and THg in the surficial litter/fungal layer of soils since the last forest fire varied between 0.6 and 1.6 mg of MeHg ha(-1) and between 130 and 590 mg of THg ha(-1) among sites differing in drainage and soil moisture. When soil Hg accumulation sites were matched with similar sites where litterfall and throughfall were collected, measured fluxes of THg to the forest floor (sources) were similar to our estimates of longterm soil accumulation rates (sinks), suggesting that the Hg in litterfall and throughfall is a new and not a recycled input of Hg to forested ecosystems. However, further research is required to determine the proportion of Hg in litterfall that is being biogeochemically recycled within forest and wetland ecosystems and, thus, does not represent new inputs to the forest ecosystem.

The heavier isotope of nitrogen (N-15) increases an average of 3 parts per thousand (parts per thousand) from prey to predator and is used as a measure of an organism's trophic position. Dorsal muscle from lake trout, burbot, walleye, northern pike, white sucker, lake cisco, lake whitefish, and yellow perch was analyzed for Hg and delta(15)N using flameless atomic absorption and mass spectrometry respectively. Within each lake, log Hg was significantly related to delta(15)N (r(2) ranged from 0.47 to 0.91, P < 0.01). For four species, yellow perch, northern pike, lake cisco, and lake trout, log Hg was positively related to delta(15)N (P ranged from 0.37 to 0.47, P less than or equal to 0.09) across all lakes. We also used delta(15)N measurements (assuming a 3 parts per thousand shift between an organism and its diet) and the developed within-lake regression equations to calculate a prey Hg for each individual fish. These food Hg values were then used to predict predator Hg using Norstrom et al's bioenergetics model. Predicted results were strongly correlated to measured Hg concentrations (r = 0.91, P < 0.001), indicating that delta(15)N has potential to be used in modeling.

Here we examine the expression of dawn singing behaviour in a free-living small songbird in relation to environmental pollution. We compared the singing behaviour of male great tits Parus major inhabiting an area extremely polluted with heavy metals with that of males inhabiting areas of low(er) pollution (at 4 and 20 km distance from the pollution source). Males at the most polluted site had a significantly smaller repertoire size than males at the two other sites. They also produced a significantly lower total amount of song during the dawn chorus than the males at a distance of 4 km from the pollution source. Our results, although non-experimental and obtained in field conditions, strongly suggest that heavy metal pollution might affect the expression of singing behaviour. Taking into account that previous studies were not able to detect clear, straightforward differences between the health of great tits at the most polluted site and at 4 km distance from the pollution source, our results suggest that the singing behaviour of great tits may be a useful indicator of environmental stress at the population level.

Measures that are inexpensive tend to be implemented and measures that are expensive tend not to be implemented by makers of public policy. That is often independent of the degree of public health protection afforded by the measures. Understanding and addressing this pattern is crucial to the control of lead exposure of critical populations. People are still exposed to lead in our society not because anyone believes that exposure is good, but because reducing exposure costs money. Maintaining exposure also has its costs, however. It is more difficult to measure them, and they are often ignored in decision making-but they are not small, and attempts to measure them have been made. The high cost of reducing lead exposure of critical populations is the reason that progress in reducing lead-paint exposure has been minimal in the 18 years since the passage of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act and that it took from the time of the initial proposal in 1973 until 1986 before lead was substantially eliminated from gasoline. In its 1986 rule making, the EPA estimated that the elimination of lead from gasoline would cost more than $500 million per year. Removing leaded paint is estimated to cost billions of dollars. The difference is that the EPA promulgated its rule of removing lead from gasoline, whereas HUD has had little success in removing leaded paint from housing. One reason that the EPA was successful in implementing such an expensive regulation was that it provided detailed estimates of the health and welfare benefits that would accrue and the monetary value of some of the benefits. The EPA cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that the monetary benefits of its regulation far exceeded the costs. That neutralized the cost issue and focused the debate over the regulation on questions of timing. A detailed benefit analysis of reducing lead in drinking water has caused the EPA to consider tighter water lead standards than initially envisioned. Despite years of concern about the consequences of leaded paint poisoning, children continue to be poisoned by leaded paint because it will cost billions of dollars to abate the hazard, and demand for these dollars has lost out to competing needs. As long as attention focuses on the costs of lead-paint abatement and ignores the costs of not abating and as long as people add up the costs of removing paint but not the costs of medical care, compensatory education, and school dropouts, substantial action is unlikely. It is possible that a detailed benefit analysis of lead-paint removal will not show that benefits exceed the costs, but we think it unlikely, given the large benefits estimated for other programs that reduce lead exposure, that a cost-beneficial removal strategy cannot be found. If no attempt is made to estimate the benefits, this strategy is less likely to be adopted. This paper cannot reasonably estimate the costs and benefits of the many measures that are available to reduce lead exposure of critical populations. It can, however, describe the methods that have been used and present a prototypical analysis that can readily be adapted to develop analyses specific to individual actions.

In this paper, the authors present a framework for distinguishing estimates of attributable cases based on time-series studies from those based on cohort studies, the latter being 5-10 times larger. The authors distinguish four categories of death associated with air pollution: A) air pollution increases both the risk of underlying diseases leading to frailty and the short term risk of death among the frail; B) air pollution increases the risk of chronic diseases leading to frailty but is unrelated to timing of death; C) air pollution is unrelated to risk of chronic diseases but short term exposure increases mortality among persons who are frail; and D) neither underlying chronic disease nor the event of death is related to air pollution exposure. Time-series approaches capture deaths from categories A and C, whereas cohort studies assess cases from categories A, B, and C. In addition, years of life lost can only be derived from cohort studies, where time to death is the outcome, while in time-series studies, death is a once-only event (no dimension in time). The authors conclude that time-series analyses underestimate cases of death attributable to air pollution and that assessment of the impact of air pollution on mortality should be based on cohort studies.

To address these points, the following subgroups of children were selected from a survey population of all 2,200 elementary school children (6 to 13 yr of age) in a pulp mill community on the west coast of Vancouver Island: (1) all children with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 75 participated), (2) all children with an exercise-induced fall in FEV1 without diagnosed asthma (n = 57), (3) all children with airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.76) without either of the above (n = 18), and (4) control children without any of the above (n = 56). The children were followed for as long as 18 mo with twice daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and daily symptom diary recording. Maximum daily PM10 concentration was 159 mu m/m(3) (median, 22.1), but only 8 d (1.2%) had concentrations above 100 mu g/m(3). In an analysis that accounted for time-varying covariates, and serially correlated and missing data, for the entire sample of children, increases in PM10 were associated with reductions in PEF and increased reporting of cough, phlegm production, and sore throat. For the subgroup of children with diagnosed asthma, PEF in the time period with the highest PM10 concentrations fell by an estimated 0.55 L/min (95% CI, 0.06 to 1.05) for a 10 mu g/m(3) PM10 increase above the mean daily PM10 concentration of 27.3 mu g/m(3) and the odds of reported cough increased by 8% (95% CI, 0 to 16%); no consistent effects were observed in the other groups of children. It is concluded that children experience reductions in PEF and increased symptoms after increases in relatively low ambient PM10 concentrations, and that children with diagnosed asthma are more susceptible to these effects than are other children.

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes.Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are lessthan/equal 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter [PM(sub 2.5)]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models.Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM(sub 2.5) or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM(sub 2.5) was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used.Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM(sub 2.5) was taken into account. We did, however, demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory causes in association with an increase in ozone concentration.

This has led to a policy conundrum: how to balance the economic and cultural impact of advising subsistence anglers to eat less fish with the economic cost of reducing the mercury concentrations in fish? State agencies with regulatory and other jurisdictional authority lack sufficient data and have no consistent approach to this problem. The present study focused on a critical and contentious region in California's Central Valley (the Sacramento San Joaquin Rivers Delta) where mercury concentrations in fish and subsistence fishing rates are both high. Anglers and community members were surveyed for their fish preferences, rates of consumption, the ways that they receive health information, and basic demographic information. The rates of fish consumption for certain ethnicities were higher than the rates used by state agencies for planning pollution remediation. A broad range of ethnic groups were involved in catching and eating fish. The majority of anglers reported catching fish in order to feed to their families, including children and women of child-bearing age. There were varied preferences for receiving health information and no correlation between knowledge of fish contamination and rates of consumption. Calculated rates of mercury intake by subsistence anglers were well above the EPA reference dose. The findings here support a comprehensive policy strategy of involvement of the diverse communities in decision-making about education and clean-up and an official recognition of subsistence fishers in the region.

DHA supplementation in pregnancy and infant problem solving in the first year have not been investigated.Objective: We tested the hypothesis that infants born to women who consumed a DHA-containing functional food during pregnancy would demonstrate better problem-solving abilities and recognition memory than would infants born to women who consumed the placebo during pregnancy.Design: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, pregnant women consumed a DHA-containing functional food or a placebo from gestation week 24 until delivery. Study groups received DHA-containing cereal-based bars (300 mg DHA/92-kcal bar; average consumption: 5 bars/wk; n = 14) or cereal-based placebo bars (n = 15).

The procedure was scored on the basis of the infant's performance on each step and on the entire problem (intention score and total intentional solutions). Scores were generated on the basis of the cumulative performance of the infant on 5 trials.Results: Treatment had significant effects on the performance of problem-solving tasks: total intention score (P = 0.017), total intentional solutions (P = 0.011), and number of intentional solutions on both cloth (P = 0.008) and cover (P = 0.004) steps.

However, the consequences of exposure error for determination of safe doses of toxic substances have so far not received much attention. The benchmark approach is one of the most widely used methods for development of exposure limits. An important advantage of this approach is that it can be applied to observational data. However, in this type of data, exposure markers are seldom measured without error. It is shown that, if the exposure error is ignored, then the benchmark approach produces results that are biased toward higher and less protective levels. It is therefore important to take exposure measurement error into account when calculating benchmark doses. Methods that allow this adjustment are described and illustrated in data from an epidemiological study on the health effects of prenatal mercury exposure.

To explore the extent of this bias, we applied structural equation modeling to data from a prospective study of developmental methylmercury neurotoxicity in the Faroe Islands.RESULTS: Adjustment for the benefits conferred by maternal fish intake during pregnancy resulted in an increased effect of the prenatal methylmercury exposure, as compared with the unadjusted remits. The dietary questionnaire response is likely to be an imprecise proxy for the transfer of seafood nutrients to the fetus, and this imprecision may bias the confounder-adjusted mercury effect estimate. We explored the magnitude of this bias in sensitivity analysis assuming a range of error variances. At realistic imprecision levels, mercury-associated deficits increased by up to 2-fold when compared with the unadjusted effects.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that uncontrolled confounding from a beneficial parameter, and imprecision of this confounder, may cause substantial underestimation of the effects of a toxic exposure. The adverse effects of methylmercury exposure from fish and seafood are therefore likely to be underestimated by unadjusted results from observational studies, and the extent of this bias will be study dependent.

In birds, foraging efficiency and learning may be sensitive endpoints for sublethal methylmercury toxicity, and these endpoints also may be biologically relevant at the population level. In the present study, groups of wild-caught, prefledgling white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were raised in a free-flight, open-Air aviary on diets that approximated the measured range of methylmercury exposure in the Everglades ecosystem (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/d). The effect of methylmercury exposure on group foraging efficiency was exarrtined by allowing birds to forage on 200 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in artificial ponds for 15 min by straining the arenas' contents through a seine net and counting all remaining prey. Additionally, we varied the difficulty of foraging by these tactile feeding birds by adding multiple levels of structural complexity (e.g., increased vegetation and prey refugia) to the pond. Structural complexity affected both foraging efficiency and the rate of increase in efficiency over time (improvement). Methylmercury exposure affected foraging efficiency (p = 0.03). It did not affect foraging improvement in the face of increasingly challenging environments, however, and the dose-response relationship was nonlinear (e.g., the control and high-exposure groups were the least efficient foragers). Evidence for an effect of methylmercury on foraging efficiency therefore was inconclusive because of unpredicted results and no interaction with time or habitat complexity. These data suggest a nonlinear dose-response relationship at low levels of methylmercury exposure; future research is needed to verify this hypothesis. This appears to be the first experimental demonstration of the effects of habitat complexity on foraging efficiency in long-legged wading birds.

However, mechanisms of endocrine impairment and net effects on demography of biota are poorly understood. Here, we report that experimental exposure of an aquatic bird over 3 years to environmentally relevant dietary MeHg concentrations (0.05-0.3 ppm wet weight) resulted in dose-related increases in male-male pairing behaviour (to 55% of males), and decreases in egg productivity (to 30%). Dosed males showed decreased rates of key courtship behaviours, and were approached less by courting females in comparison to control males. Within dosed groups, homosexual males showed a similar reduction when compared with dosed heterosexual males. We found an average 35 per cent decrease in fledgling production in high-dose birds over the study duration. These results are of interest because (i) MeHg exposure is experimentally tied to demographically important reproductive deficits, (ii) these effects were found at low, chronic exposure levels commonly experienced by wildlife, and (iii) effects on reproductive behaviour and sexual preference mediated by endocrine disruption represent a novel and probably under-reported mechanism by which contaminants may influence wild populations of birds.

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a ""one-atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation. This paper describes the Models-3 CMAQ system, its governing equations, important science algorithms, and a few application examples. This review article cites 114 references.

We hypothesized that this paradox could be in part explained by high mercury content in fish.Methods and Results We studied the relation of the dietary intake of fish and mercury, as well as hair content and urinary excretion of mercury, to the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and any cause in 1833 men aged 42 to 60 years who were free of clinical CHD, stroke, claudication, and cancer. Of these, 73 experienced an AMI in 2 to 7 years. Of the 78 deceased men, 18 died of CHD and 24 died of CVD. Men who had consumed local nonfatty fish species had elevated hair mercury contents. In Cox models with the major cardiovascular risk factors as covariates, dietary intakes of fish and mercury were associated with significantly increased risk of AMI and death from CHD, CVD, and any death. Men in the highest tertile (greater than or equal to 2.0 mu g/g) of hair mercury content had a 2.0-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.1; P=.005) age- and CHD-adjusted risk of AMI and a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 6.6; P=.014) adjusted risk of cardiovascular death compared with those with a lower hair mercury content. In a nested case-control subsample, the 24-hour urinary mercury excretion had a significant (P=.042) independent association with the risk of AMI. Both the hair and urinary mercury associated significantly with titers of immune complexes containing oxidized LDL.Conclusions These data suggest that a high intake of mercury from nonfatty freshwater fish and the consequent accumulation of mercury in the body are associated with an excess risk of AMI as well as death from CHD, CVD, and any cause in Eastern Finnish men and this increased risk may be due to the promotion of lipid peroxidation by mercury.

A total of 194 men had a fatal or nonfatal acute coronary event during follow-up. In a Cox proportional hazards' model adjusting for other risk factors, men in the highest fifth of the proportion of serum DHA-I-DPA in all fatty acids had a 44% reduced risk (P=0.014) of acute coronary events compared with men in the lowest fifth.

In a linear regression model adjusting for other atherosclerotic risk factors, high hair mercury content was one of the strongest predictors of the 4-year increase in the mean IMT (P = 0.0007). On the average, for each mu g/g increase in hair mercury content, there was an increment of 8 mu m (7.3% of the mean) in the 4-year IMT increase.

The IMT increase was 0.034 mm/4 years (31.9%) greater in the highest fifth than in the other fifths (P < 0.05 for the difference).

Fish methylmercury concentrations are high in many reservoirs(2) and acidic lakes(3), and also in many remote lakes(4,5)-a fact that may be related to increased atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically mobilized mercury during the past few decades(6). Although sources of methylmercury to lakes and reservoirs are known(7), in-lake destruction has not been demonstrated to occur at the low concentrations found in most water bodies. Here we report in situ incubations of lake water that show that methylmercury is decomposed by photo-degradation in surface waters. This process is abiotic and the rate is first-order with respect to methylmercury concentration and the intensity of solar radiation. In our study lake, the calculated annual rates of methylmercury photodegradation are almost double the estimated external inputs of methylmercury from rain, snow, streamflow and land runoff, implying the existence of a large source of methylmercury from bottom sediments. Photodegradation could also be an important process in the mercury cycle of other aquatic systems. This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of aquatic mercury cycling, and challenges the long-accepted view that microbial demethylation dominates methylmercury degradation in natural fresh waters.

Experiments were performed to investigate the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of particle-associated Hg-I and MMHg by the estuarine amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus to further understand the controls on bioaccumulation by benthic organisms. Hg-I and MMHg are particle reactive and have a strong affinity for organic matter, a potential food source for amphipods. Microcosm laboratory experiments were performed to determine the effects of organic matter on Hg bioaccumulation and to determine the major route of Hg uptake (i.e. sediment ingestion, uptake from water/porewater, or uptake from 'food'). Amphipods living in organic-rich sediment spiked with Hg accumulated less Hg than those living in sediments with a lower organic matter content. Feeding had a significant impact on the amount of Hg and MMHg accumulated. Similarly, amphipods living in water with little organic matter accumulated more Hg than those living in water with a greater percentage of organic matter. MMHg was more readily available for uptake than Hg-I. Experimental results, coupled with results from a bioaccumulation model, suggest that accumulation of Hg-I and MMHg from sediment cannot be accurately predicted based solely on the total Hg, or even the MMHg, concentration of the sediment, and sediment-based bioaccumulation factors.

Gastric fluid collected from each species was incubated with CH3Hg(II)-spiked sediment or bloodworms, after which the intestinal fluid of each species was added and incubated further. The proportion of CH3Hg(II) solubilized from bloodworms and sediment appeared to be controlled by complexation to amino acids in both the stomach and the intestinal fluids during the digestive process,with the more thorough digestion of bloodworm organic material enhancing CH3Hg(II) solubilization. A greater proportion of CH3Hg(II) was solubilized by the sturgeon fluids compared to the catfish fluids, especially for the sediment incubations. These differences corresponded to the relative amount of amino acids in the fluids of these fish. A comparison of the catfish gastrointestinal solubilization incubations and a CH3Hg(II) bioaccumulation experiment with bloodworms revealed that the solubilization incubations may be a reasonable surrogate measurement of the bioavailability of CH3Hg(II) to fish.

While binding of H and CH3Hg to organic ligands reduced the rate of uptake in most instances, the differences in accumulation could not be explained only in terms of passive diffusive uptake. Thus, it appears that Hg and CH3Hg accumulation is dominated by ligand exchange or facilitated transport processes. Exposure of the gills and intestine in the presence of a suite of metals and metalloids showed that inorganic Hg and CH3Hg uptake was largely by different mechanisms to that of the other elements, as there was little interaction in terms of uptake rate.

Measurements of total HD and mercury speciation (MMHg and dissolved gaseous Hg (DGHg)) have been made in the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay system, including sampling transects into Baltimore Harbor, a region where sediment Hg concentrations can exceed 5 nmol g(-1) and sediment MMHg concentrations approach 50 pmol g(-1). Surface water Hg concentrations are typical of an impacted urban estuary that has a high suspended sediment load (SPM; typically > 5 mg l(-1)), and for the upper Bay, where total Hg is generally 20 pM or less, particulate Hg is the dominant fraction, Total Hg concentrations tend to decrease down-estuary, and this is also true for the sub-estuaries (Potomac and Patuxent Rivers). This decrease coincides with a decrease in SPM, but urban inputs are also higher up-estuary. Measurement of total Hg and MMHg in the anoxic bottom waters that develop seasonally in the harbor demonstrate the increased concentration of Hg, and especially MMHg, under low oxygen conditions, and the most likely source is the release of these species from sediments. Both intensive studies and long-term measurements show that the concentration of DGHg is relatively low in this system (typically < 0.2 phl) and DGHg is a small fraction of the total Hg. Based on the information available, a preliminary mass balance budget is constructed for the Chesapeake Bay, Direct atmospheric deposition contributes a substantial portion of the Hg to the Bay while sedimentary removal is the principal sink. Overall, 29% of the riverine and atmospheric inputs to the Bay is exported to the coastal ocean. Thus, the Bay is an efficient trap for Hg. The Bay is, however, a net source of MMHg suggesting that significant methylation of Hg occurs within the estuary. On a watershed scale, only about 5% of the total atmospheric deposition to the watershed is exported to the coastal ocean. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Filterable (0.2 mu m) Hg-T ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 ng L-1. On average, MeHg accounted for <5% of unfiltered Hg-T and <2% of filterable Hg-T. Dissolved gaseous Hg (DGHg) concentrations were highest (up to 150 pg L-1) in the summer in the mesohaline section, but were not well correlated with primary production or chlorophyll a, demonstrating the complex nature of Hg-o formation and cycling in an estuarine environment. Organic matter content appeared to control the Hg-T content of sediments, while MeHg in sediments was positively correlated with Hg-T and organic matter, and negatively correlated with sulfide. MeHg in sediments was low (0.1 to 0.5% of Hg-T). Preliminary findings suggest that net MeHg production within sediments exceeds net accumulation. Although Hg-T in pore waters increased with increasing sulfide, bulk MeHg concentrations decreased. The concentration of MeHg in sediments was not related to the concentration of Hg-T in pore waters. These observations support the hypothesis that sulfide affects the speciation and therefore bioavailability of dissolved and/or solid-phase Hg for methylation.

The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health.

At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high.

The model utilized mercury monitoring data collected during the Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study and the Atmospheric Exchange Over Lakes and Oceans Study together with high-resolution over-water meteorological data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (July, 1994-October, 1995). Atmospheric deposition was determined to be the primary pathway for mercury input to Lake Michigan, contributing approximately 84% of the estimated 1403 kg total annual input (atmospheric deposition + tributary input). Wet (10.6 mug m(-2)) and dry deposition (9.7 mug m(-2)) contributed almost equally to the annual atmospheric Hg deposition of 20.3 mug m(-2) (1173 kg). Re-emission of dissolved gaseous Hg from the lake was also significant (7.8 mug m(-2)), reducing the net atmospheric deposition to 12.5 mug m(-2) (720 kg). A strong urban influence was observed in the over-water mercury deposition estimates in the southern portion of the lake. The Chicago/Gary urban area was estimated to contribute approximately 20% (127 kg) of the annual atmospheric mercury deposition to Lake Michigan. The magnitude of local anthropogenic mercury sources in the Chicago/Gary urban area suggests that emission reductions could significantly reduce atmospheric mercury deposition into Lake Michigan.

Mercury in foliage did not behave similarly to eight other elements with known soil or aerosol sources (Aluminum (Al), Vanadium (V), Strontium (Sr), Rubidium (Rb), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Barium (Ba), and lead (Pb)), suggesting that Hg originated from a distinct pathway. Based on measured and modeled data, uptake of only 25% of the available ambient dry deposited Hg(0) could explain all of the Hg measured in foliage throughout the growing season. Estimates of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)) uptake from soil water accounted for 3-14%% of the Hg in litterfall. Mercury deposition to forested sites in the Lake Champlain and Lake Huron basins was highest in litterfall (40%), followed by total throughfall (33%), and precipitation (27%).

We hypothesized that during leafout, whole mesocosm Hg(0) flux would increase due to movement of Hg(0) in the transpiration stream from the soil to the air. This hypothesis was not supported; plants were found to assimilate Hg(0) from the contaminated air, and whole system Hg(0) emissions were reduced as plants leafed-out due to shading of the soil. Surface disturbance, watering, and increases in soil moisture, light, and temperature were all found to increase whole system Hg(0) flux, with light being a more significant factor. Although surface soils were maintained at 15-20% moisture, daily watering caused pulses of Hg(0) to be released from the soil throughout the experiment. Data developed in this experiment suggested that those processes acting on the soil surface are the primary influence on Hg emissions and that the presence of vegetation, which shields soil surfaces from incident light, reduces Hg emissions from enriched soils.

Foliar Hg concentrations increased as a function of leaf age and leveled off after 2-3 months in the oldest tissue with a mean tissue concentration of 150 ng g(-1). Approximately 80% of the total Hg accumulated in the aboveground biomass was found in the leaves, and roughly 1% of that Hg was methylated.

Small gas-exchange systems were used to measure stomatal uptake of Hg vapor, and the mean Hg flux was -3.3 ng m(-2) h(-1). These experiments showed that almost all of the Hg in foliar tissue originated from the atmosphere. Thus, in the fall when deciduous trees enter dormancy and leaves senesce, litterfall would represent a new Hg input to terrestrial ecosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Low heart rate variability, a marker of poor cardiac autonomic control, is associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. To address the possible mechanisms for PM-cardiovascular disease mortality, we examined the cardiac autonomic response to daily variations in PM in 26 elderly (mean age 81) individuals for 3 consecutive weeks. Several standardized methods were used to measure 24-hr average PM concentrations prior to the clinical test inside (indoor PM2.5) and immediately outside (outdoor PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) of participants' residences. Resting, supine, 6-min R wave to R wave (R-R) interval data were collected to estimate high frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) and low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) powers and standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) as cardiac autonomic control indices. Participant-specific lower heart rate variability days were defined as days for which the high-frequency indices fell below the first tertile of the individual's high-frequency distribution over the study period. Indoor PM2.5 > 15 mu g/m(3) was used to define high pollution days. Results show that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of low heart rate variability high frequency for high (vs. not high) pollution days was 3.08 (1.43, 6.59). The beta-coefficients (standard error) from mixed models to assess the quantitative relationship between variations in indoor PM2.5 and the log-transformed high frequency, low frequency, and SDNN were: -0.029 (0.010), -0.027 (0.009), and -0.004 (0.003), respectively. This first study of cardiac autonomic control response to daily variations of PM2.5 indicates that increased levels of PM2.5 are associated with lower cardiac autonomic control, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between PM and cardiovascular disease mortality.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6) are important for development of the central nervous system in mammals. There is a growth spurt in the human brain during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first postnatal months, with a large increase in the cerebral content of AA and DHA. The fetus and the newborn infant depend on maternal supply of DHA and AA. Our hypothesis was that maternal intake of DHA during pregnancy and lactation is marginal and that high intake of this fatty acid would benefit the child. We examined the effect of supplementing pregnant and lactating women with very-long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; cod liver oil) on mental development of the children, compared with maternal supplementation with long-chain n-6 PUFAs (corn oil).Methods. The study was randomized and double-blinded. Pregnant women were recruited in week 18 of pregnancy to take 10 mL of cod liver oil or corn oil until 3 months after delivery. The cod liver oil contained 1183 mg/10 mL DHA, 803 mg/ 10 mL eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3), and a total of 2494 mg/ 10 mL Sigma n-3 PUFAs. The corn oil contained 4747 mg/ 10 mL linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) and 92 mg/ 10 mL alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3). The amount of fat-soluble vitamins was identical in the 2 oils (117 mug/mL vitamin A, 1 mug/mL vitamin D, and 1.4 mg/mL d1-alpha-tocopherol). A total of 590 pregnant women were recruited to the study, and 341 mothers took part in the study until giving birth. All infants of these women were scheduled for assessment of cognitive function at 6 and 9 months of age, and 262 complied with the request. As part of the protocol, 135 subjects from this population were invited for intelligence testing with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) at 4 years of age. Of the 135 invited children, 90 came for assessment. Six children did not complete the examination. The K-ABC is a measure of intelligence and achievement designed for children aged 2.5 years through 12.5 years. This multisubtest battery comprises 4 scales: Sequential Processing, Simultaneous Processing, Achievement (not used in the present study), and Nonverbal Abilities. The Sequential Processing and Simultaneous Processing scales are hypothesized to reflect the child's style of problem solving and information processing. Scores from these 2 scales are combined to form a Mental Processing Composite, which serves as the measure of intelligence in the K-ABC.Results. We received dietary information from 76 infants (41 in the cod liver oil group and 35 in the corn oil group), documenting that all of them were breastfed at 3 months of age. Children who were born to mothers who had taken cod liver oil (n = 48) during pregnancy and lactation scored higher on the Mental Processing Composite of the K-ABC at 4 years of age as compared with children whose mothers had taken corn oil (n = 36; 106.4 [7.4] vs 102.3 [11.3]). The Mental Processing Composite score correlated significantly with head circumference at birth (r = 0.23), but no relation was found with birth weight or gestational length. The children's mental processing scores at 4 years of age correlated significantly with maternal intake of DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid during pregnancy. In a multiple regression model, maternal intake of DHA during pregnancy was the only variable of statistical significance for the children's mental processing scores at 4 years of age.Conclusion. Maternal intake of very-long-chain n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy and lactation may be favorable for later mental development of children.

During the past three decades, studies in fish have examined the effects of sublethal mercury exposure on a range of endpoints within the reproductive axis. Mercury studies have varied from highly concentrated aqueous exposures to ecologically relevant dietary exposures using levels comparable to those currently found in the environment. This review summarizes data from both laboratory and field studies supporting the hypothesis that mercury in the aquatic environment impacts the reproductive health of fish. The evidence presented suggests that the inhibitory effects of mercury on reproduction occur at multiple sites within the reproductive axis, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. Accumulation of mercury in the fish brain has resulted in reduced neurosecretory material, hypothalamic neuron degeneration, and alterations in parameters of monoaminergic neurotransmission. At the level of the pituitary, mercury exposure has reduced and/or inactivated gonadotropin-secreting cells. Finally, studies have examined the effects of mercury on the reproductive organs and demonstrated a range of effects, including reductions in gonad size, circulating reproductive steroids, gamete production, and spawning success. Despite some variation between studies, there appears to be sufficient evidence from laboratory studies to link exposure to mercury with reproductive impairment in many fish species. Currently, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown; however, several physiological and cellular mechanisms are proposed within this review.

Here we investigate the role of microbial mercury oxidation and reduction in regulating DGM diet patterns in two freshwater lakes, Jack's Lake and Lake Ontario. Three replicate diurnal cycles of DGM in Brookes Bay, Jack's Lake peaked at 313 fM between 9:00 to 10:30 and decreased to 79.6 fM by 16:00. Microbial mercury reductase activity (converts Hg2+ to Hg-0) increased with DGM concentrations and mercury oxidase activity (converts Hg-0 to Hg2+) increased as DGM concentrations decreased in the mid-afternoon. This illustrates that mercury oxidase activity was linked to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) diurnal patterns. Thirty minutes after spiking Lake Ontario water with H2O2, mercury oxidase activity increased by 250% and by 60 min, DGM decreased to 28% of its initial value. Two hours after the H2O2 spike, mercury oxidase activity had declined, but mercury reductase activity and DGM both increased. Four hours after the spike, mercury reductase and DGM levels had returned to original levels. Our results are consistent with the following sequence, of events. In the morning, microbial activity produces DGM (in addition to an DGM formed through photoreduction of Hg2+). As photochemically produced H2O2 increases in concentration it induces the biologically mediated decrease in DGM concentrations throughout the afternoon. To oredict concentration of DGM in surface waters and flux rates to the atmosphere, the contribution of photoreduction and photooxidation must be placed in context with reduction and oxidation rates due to microbial activity.

We recently reported that nutrients present in fish may modify MeHg neurotoxicity. Understanding the apparent interaction of MeHg exposure and nutrients present in fish is complicated by the limitations of modeling methods. In this study we fit varying coefficient function models to data from the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study (SCDNS) cohort to assess the association of dietary nutrients and children's development. This cohort of mother-child pairs in the Republic of Seychelles had fish consumption averaging 9 meals per week. Maternal nutritional status was assessed for five different nutritional components known to be present in fish (n-3 LCPUFA, n-6 LCPUFA, iron status, iodine status, and choline) and associated with children's neurological development. We also included prenatal MeHg exposure (measured in maternal hair). We examined two child neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley Scales Infant Development-II (BSID-II) Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI)), each administered at 9 and at 30 months. The varying coefficient models allow the possible interactions between each nutritional component and MeHg to be modeled as a smoothly varying function of MeHg as an effect modifier. Iron, iodine, choline, and n-6 LCPUFA had little or no observable modulation at different MeHg exposures. In contrast the n-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had beneficial effects on the BSID-II PDI that were reduced or absent at higher MeHg exposures. This study presents a useful modeling method that can be brought to bear on questions involving interactions between covariates, and illustrates the continuing importance of viewing fish consumption during pregnancy as a case of multiple exposures to nutrients and to MeHg. The results encourage more emphasis on a holistic view of the risks and benefits of fish consumption as it relates to infant development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Previous investigations of fish intake in relation to neurodevelopment have focused on possible damage from contaminants, whereas potential benefits of fish consumption have been relatively unexploredMethods: We evaluated the association between maternal fish intake during pregnancy and offspring's early development of language and communication skills in a cohort of 7421 British children born in 1991-1992. Fish intake by the mother and child was measured by questionnaire. The child's cognitive development was assessed using adaptations of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory at 15 months of age and the Denver Developmental Screening Test at 18 months of age. Mercury was measured in umbilical cord tissue for a subset of 1054 childrenResults: Total mercury concentrations were low and were not associated with neurodevelopment. Fish intake by the mother during pregnancy, and by the infant postnatally, was associated with higher mean developmental scores. For example, the adjusted mean MacArthur comprehension score for children whose mothers con- sumed fish 4 or more times per week was 72 (95% confidence interval = 71-74), compared with 68 (66-71) among those whose mothers did not consume fish.Conclusions: When fish is not contaminated, moderate fish intake during pregnancy and infancy may benefit development.

Specifically, we examined a priori models of Omega-3 and Omega-6 LCPUFA measures in maternal serum to test the hypothesis that these LCPUFA families before or after adjusting for prenatal MeHg exposure would reveal associations with child development assessed by the BSID-II at ages 9 and 30 months. There were 229 children with complete outcome and covariate data available for analysis. At 9 months, the PDI was positively associated with total Omega-3 LCPUFA and negatively associated with the ratio of Omega-6/Omega-3 LCPUFA. These associations were stronger in models adjusted for prenatal MeHg exposure. Secondary models suggested that the MeHg effect at 9 months varied by the ratio Omega-6/Omega-3 LCPUFA. There were no significant associations between LCPUFA measures and the PDI at 30 months. There were significant adverse associations, however, between prenatal MeHg and the 30-month PDI when the LCPUFA measures were included in the regression analysis. The BSID-II mental developmental index (MDI) was not associated with any exposure variable. These data support the potential importance to child development of prenatal availability of Omega-3 LCPUFA present in fish and of LCPUFA in the overall diet. Furthermore, they indicate that the beneficial effects of LCPUFA can obscure the determination of adverse effects of prenatal MeHg exposure in longitudinal observational studies.

The present study tested the hypothesis that the intake of selected nutrients in fish or measures of maternal nutritional status may represent important confounders when estimating the effects of prenatal methylmercury exposure on child development. The study took place in the Republic of Seychelles, an Indian ocean archipelago where fish consumption is high. A longitudinal cohort study design was used. A total of 300 mothers were enrolled early in pregnancy. Nutrients considered to be important for brain development were measured during pregnancy along with prenatal MeHg exposure. The children were evaluated periodically to age 30 months. There were 229 children with complete outcome and covariate data for analysis. The primary endpoint was the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II), administered at 9 and 30 months of age. Combinations of four secondary measures of infant cognition and memory were also given at 5,9 and 25 months. Cohort mothers consumed an average of 537 g of fish (nine meals containing fish) per week. The average prenatal MeHg exposure was 5.9 ppm in maternal hair. The primary analysis examined the associations between MeHg, maternal nutritional measures and children's scores on the BSID-II and showed an adverse association between MeHg and the mean Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) score at 30 months. Secondary analyses of the association between the PDI and only MeHg alone or nutritional factors alone showed only a borderline significant association between MeHg and the PDI at 30 months and no associations with nutritional factors. One experimental measure at 5 months of age was positively associated with iodine status, but not prenatal MeHg exposure. These findings suggest a possible confounding role of maternal nutrition in studies examining associations between prenatal MeHg exposures and developmental outcomes in children.

Research conducted on the methylation of mercury strongly suggests that the process is microbial in nature and facilitated principally by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This study addressed the potential for mercury methylation by varying sulfate treatments and wetland-based soil in microbial slurry reactors with available inorganic mercury. Under anoxic laboratory conditions conducive to the growth of naturally occurring sulfate-reducing bacteria in the soil, it was possible to evaluate how various sulfate additions influenced the methylation of inorganic mercury added to overlying water as well as the sequestration of dissolved copper. Treatments included sulfate amendments ranging from 25 to 500 mg/L (0.26 to 5.2 mM) above the soil's natural sulfate level. Mercury methylation in sulfate treatments did not exceed that of the nonamended control during a 35-day incubation period. However, increases in methylmercury concentration were linked to bacterial growth and sulfate reduction. A time lag in methylation in the highest treatment correlated with an equivalent lag in bacterial growth. The decrease in dissolved copper ranged from 72.7% in the control to 99.7% in the highest sulfate treatment. It was determined that experimental systems such as these can provide some useful information but that they also have severe limitations once sulfate is depleted or if sulfate is used in excess.

An active surveillance system ascertained the numbers and types of absences during the first 6 months of 1996. Pollutants were measured hourly at central-site monitors in each of the 12 communities. To examine acute effects of air pollution on absence rates, we fitted a two-stage time series model to the absence count data that included distributed lag effects of exposure adjusted for long-term pollutant levels. Short-term change in O-3, but not NO2 or PM10, was associated with a substantial increase in school absences from both upper and lower respiratory illness. An increase of 20 ppb of O-3 was associated with an increase of 62.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 18.4-124.1%] for illness-related absence rates, 82.9% (95% CI = 3.9-222.0%) for respiratory illnesses, 45.1% (95% CI = 21.3-73.7%) for upper respiratory illnesses, and 173.9% (95% CI = 91.3-292.3%) for lower respiratory illnesses with wet cough. The short-term effects of a 20-ppb change of O-3 on illness-related absenteeism were larger in communities with lower long-term average PM10 [223.5% (95% CI = 90.4-449.7)] compared with communities with high average levels [38.1% (95% CI = 8.5-75.8)]. Increased school absenteeism from O-3 exposure in children is an important adverse effect of ambient air pollution worthy of public policy consideration.

Mercury concentrations were determined in cord blood and in the child's hair.Results Both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) activities decreased by about 25% from 7 to 14 years; they correlated well with the blood pressures. A doubling of prenatal MeHg exposure was associated with a decrease in LF and HF powers of about 6.7% (P = .04) and in the coefficient of variation of the electrocardiographic R-R interval of 2.7% (P = .04) at age 14 years. No discernible effect on blood pressure was apparent. Decreased LF variability was associated with increased latency of BAEP peak III, but adjustment for MeHg exposure substantially attenuated this correlation.Conclusions Methylmercury exposure was associated with decreased sympathetic (LF) and parasympathetic (HF) modulation of the HRV. Parallel MeHg-related delays of BAEP latencies may be caused by underlying MeHg neurotoxicity to brainstem nuclei.

The ratio between concentrations in maternal hair (in mug/g) and in cord blood (mug/L) was approximately 200, but samples from the children at age 14 years showed a ratio of about 250. These findings are in accordance with previous data from smaller studies. However, an even higher ratio of about 360 was seen at 7 years of age, suggesting that hair strands at this age retain more mercury. The 95th percentile of the hair-to-blood ratio was between five-fold and nine-fold greater than the 5th percentile. The results were examined in structural equation models to estimate the total imprecision of the individual biomarker results and the possibility that the ratio may not be constant. The hair-to-blood ratio was found to increase at lower mercury concentrations, a tendency that could not be explained by potential confounders, such as alcohol intake or number of amalgam fillings. The total imprecision (coefficient of variation) for the blood determinations averaged about 30%, thereby substantially exceeding normal laboratory imprecision. Yet hair-mercury results had an even greater imprecision, which suggested that preanalytical factors, such as variable sample characteristics, impacted the results. These findings are in accordance with other evidence that the cord blood concentration is a better predictor of neurobehavioral toxicity than is the maternal hair concentration. Although practical for field studies and monitoring purposes, hair-mercury concentration results, therefore, need to be calibrated and interpreted in regard to each specific study setting.

Hydrological processes largely govern the magnitude of the flux of MeHg. Seasonal and inter-annual variability in hydrology produce variable source strengths of MeHg throughout the catchment. The mass flux of MeHg within, and from the catchment is dependent on the mass flux of water and the relative placement of landscape units in the catchment hydrological cascade. Hydrology also governs the maintenance of the methylating environments in the catchment. Specifically, hydrological processes maintain zones of anoxia in both the catchment uplands and peatlands that support obligate anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria. In addition, groundwater flow paths are an essential control on the delivery of sulphate to these bacteria that facilitate in situ mercury methylation.

We previously conducted a study showing a relationship between asthma visits in all persons < 65 years of age to emergency departments (EDs) and air pollution in Seattle, Washington. In that study the most frequent zip codes of the visits were in the inner city. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health (Seattle, WA) subsequently published a report which showed that the hospitalization rate for children in the inner city was over 600/100,000, whereas it was < 100/100,000 for children living in the suburbs. Therefore, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether asthma visits to hospital emergency departments in the inner city of Seattle were associated,vith outdoor air pollution levels. ED visits to six hospitals for asthma and daily air pollution data were obtained for 15 months during 1995 and 1996. The association between air pollution and childhood ED visits for asthma from the inner city area with high asthma hospitalization rates were compared with those from lower hospital utilization areas. Daily ED counts were regressed against fine particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide using a semiparametric Poisson regression model.

Baseline geochemical surveys indicate that Hg is a significant and highly variable natural constituent of bedrock, surficial sediments, and vegetation. To evaluate the geological contribution of Hg to aquatic systems and to the atmosphere, methods are needed to translate existing spatial geochemical data into annual flux estimates. At the global scale, estimates of the geological component of the atmospheric Hg cycle vary widely, depending on which sources are considered, the magnitude of the Hg emission factors used, and the geographic area to which these emission factors are applied. Plate tectonic theory offers a useful framework for interpreting Hg distribution patterns on the earth's surface and a means of quantifying the magnitude of geological loading to the oceans, the latter being a critical component of the global Hg cycle.

Independent variables included biological traits such as fish trophic position and body condition, spatial traits such as lake hydrologic position and surrounding wetland abundance, and chemical traits such as pH and water color.

We present the results from two research cruises on total Hg (HgT) and methylmercury (MeHg) distributions in aqueous and particulate phases, and in offshore sediments. Open waters of Lake Superior are similar in HgT content to Lakes Michigan and Ontario (subng L-1), whereas MeHg was only 1% of HgT. Seasonality in aqueous HgT distribution was observed, most likely from tributary inputs during Spring snowmelt. Suspended particles were enriched in MeHg relative to water and surficial sediments, suggesting enhanced particle partitioning followed by demethylation in the water column and in surface sediments. Distribution coefficients for mercury in surficial sediments were lower than those in suspended material, likely due to remineralization. Preliminary estimates of mass balance indicate that air-water exchange processes such as evasion and wet deposition dominate the HgT budget, due to the basin's relatively small watershed area relative to lake area. In contrast, methylmercury cycling within Lake Superior is influenced more strongly by watershed sources, as well as by sedimentary sources and photodemethylation. The Hg cycle in Lake Superior is unique in that it is more similar in many aspects to that in marine systems than in small lakes, where management data for freshwaters typically originates.

Parallel decreases have been observed in the surface waters of the lake. Here we extend the observations to the fish community and we present evidence of a contemporaneous decline in levels of Hg in fish tissue. By comparing data from two separated basins of the lake, we then make an initial effort to isolate and quantify the relative importance of de-acidification and reduced Hg deposition on mercury contamination in fish. Statistical modeling indicates that fish Hg in both basins decreased by roughly 30% between 1994 and 2000 (-5%/y) due to decreased atmospheric Hg loading. De-acidification could account for an additional 5% decrease in one basin (-0.8%/y) and a further 30% decrease in the other basin (-5%/y), since the basins de-acidified at very different rates. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that depositional inputs of SO(4) and Hg((II)) co-mediate the biosynthesis of methyl mercury and thereby co-limit bioaccumulation. And they suggest that modest changes in acid rain or mercury deposition can significantly affect mercury bioaccumulation over short-time scales. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Unfiltered concentrations were typical of those reported for freshwater and ranged from 0.9 to 27.1 ng L-1 HgT and from 0.08 to 0.86 ng L-1 MeHg. For some rivers, HgT and MeHg in the colloidal phase comprised up to 72% of the respective unfiltered concentration. On average, however, HgT and MeHg concentrations were evenly distributed between the particulate (>0.4 mum), colloidal, and dissolved (< 10 kDa) phases. The pool of Hg in the colloidal phase decreased with increasing specific conductance. Results from experiments on freshwaters with artificially elevated specific conductance suggest that HgT and MeHg may partition to different subfractions of colloidal material. The colloidal-phase HgT correlation with filtered organic carbon (OCF) was generally poor (r(2) < 0.14; p > 0.07), but the regression of MeHg with OCF Was strong, especially in the upper Midwest (r(2) = 0.78; p < 0.01). On a mass basis, colloidal-phase Hg concentrations were similar to those of unimpacted sediments in the Midwest. Mercury to carbon ratios averaged 352 pg of Hg-T/ mg of C and 25 pg of MeHg/mg of C and were not correlated to ionic strength. The log of the partition coefficient (log K-D) for HgT and MeHg ranged from 3.7 to 6.4 and was typical of freshwater values determined using a 0.4 mum cutoff between the particulate phase and the dissolved phase. Log K-D calculated using the < 10 kDa fraction as ""dissolved"" ranged from 4.3 to 6.6 and had a smaller standard deviation about the mean. In addition, our data support the ""particle concentration effect"" (PCE) hypothesis that the association of Hg with colloids in the filter-passing fraction can lower the observed log K-D. The similarity between colloidal and particulate-phase partition coefficients suggests that colloidal mass and not preferential colloidal partitioning drives the PCE.

The most common form of prenatal exposure is maternal fish consumption, but whether such exposure harms the fetus is unknown. We aimed to identify adverse neurodevelopmental effects in a fish-consuming population.Methods We investigated 779 mother-infant pairs residing in the Republic of Seychelles. Mothers reported consuming fish on average 12 meals per week. Fish in Seychelles contain much the same concentrations of MeHg as commercial ocean fish elsewhere. Prenatal MeHg exposure was determined from maternal hair growing during pregnancy. We assessed neurocognitive, language, memory, motor, perceptual-motor, and behavioural functions in children at age 9 years. The association between prenatal MeHg exposure and the primary endpoints was investigated with multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates that affect child development.Findings Mean prenatal MeHg exposure was 6.9 parts per million (SD 4.5ppm). Only two endpoints were associated with prenatal MeHg exposure. Increased exposure was associated with decreased performance in the grooved pegboard using the non-dominant hand in males and improved scores in the hyperactivity index of the Conner's teacher rating scale.

A preparation factor relating mercury concentrations in fish as prepared for consumption to mercury concentration data as measured in typical environmental monitoring programs was calculated. Preparation factors are needed to provide risk assessors with a more accurate estimate of the actual amount of mercury ingested through consumption of contaminated fish.Data on fish preparation and consumption practices of two communities of Chippewa residing on the shores of Lake Superior in northern Wisconsin were used to select practices for study. The most commonly consumed species, walleye and lake trout, were selected. Whitefish livers were also selected for study. Commonly wed cooking techniques including panfrying, deep-frying, baking, boiling, and smoking were duplicated in the laboratory. Total mercury concentrations were determined in fish portions before and after cooking and in a portion representative of that analyzed in programs to assess water quality (skin-on fillets). Total mercury was determined by microwave digestion-cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy.Mercury concentrations (wet weight basis) in panfried, baked, and bailed walleye fillets and deep-fried and baked whitefish livers ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 times higher than in corresponding raw portions. In lake trout, mercury concentrations were 1.5 to 2.0 times higher in cooked portions than in the raw portion. However total mercury levels were constant before and after cooking, indicating the concentration effect is caused by weight (moisture and fat) loss. The addition of lemon juice to potentially release mercury from its bound state and promote volatilization did not exert any measurable influence on mercury concentrations in cooked walleye. In some cases mercury concentrations were increased with increased cooking times due to further loss of moisture and fat. Preparation factors (defined as the ratio of mercury concentration in cooked fish to the mercury concentration in the environmental portion) ranged from 1.3 to 2.0. Results suggest that consideration be given so the use of preparation factors in risk assessments, exposure assessments, or issuance of fish advisories where mercury concentrations in raw fish tissue are used in conjunction with cooked fish meal sizes.

NOx-dependent aromatic SOA yields are also added along with new empirical measurements of the enthalpies of vaporization and organic mass-to-carbon ratios. For the first time, these SOA precursors, pathways and empirical parameters are included simultaneously in an air quality model for an annual simulation spanning the continental U.S. Comparisons of CMAQ-modeled secondary organic carbon (OCsec) with semiempirical estimates screened from 165 routine monitoring sites across the U.S. indicate the new SOA module substantially improves model performance. The most notable improvement occurs in the central and southeastern U.S. where the regionally averaged temporal correlations (r) between modeled and semiempirical OCsec increase from -0.5 to 0.8 and -0.3 to 0.8, respectively, when the new SOA module is employed.

Fish advisories are established to protect local populations from the consumption of contaminated commercial and non-commercially caught fish. Children, women of childbearing age, and subsistence fishermen or other highly exposed individuals who for socioeconomic or cultural reasons consume more fish than the general population are among the populations of concern from the ingestion of contaminated fish. Estimating exposure to a toxic chemical among fish-consuming populations requires knowledge about intake rates of fish and shellfish. Data on fish consumption rates come from various sources, including national, state, and local government studies. Although these data have their limitations, they serve as a source for deriving fish consumption rates that may be used by exposure assessors. Data on specific populations of concern are critical. Studies presented here show that ethnicity, age, and geographical region play an important role in fishing behavior and consumption. Results from studies on Native American populations show that this ethnic group eats fish at a higher rate than recreational anglers. This article summarizes data on fish consumption for various populations and provides a framework for evaluating data from these studies for exposure assessment applications.

We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.

Dose-response information for this relationship is useful for estimating benefits of reduced mercury exposure.OBJECTIVES: We estimated a dose-response relationship between maternal mercury body burden and subsequent childhood decrements in intelligence quotient (IQ), using a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate data from three epidemiologic studies.METHODS: Inputs to the model consist of dose-response coefficients from studies conducted in the Faroe Islands, New Zealand, and the Seychelles Islands. IQ coefficients were available from previous work for the latter two studies, and a coefficient for the Faroe Islands study was estimated from three IQ subtests. Other tests of cognition/achievement were included in the hierarchical model to obtain more accurate estimates of study-to-study and end point-to-end point variability.RESULTS: We find a central estimate of -0.18 IQ points (95% confidence interval, -0.378 to -0.009) for each parts per million increase of maternal hair mercury, similar to the estimates for both the Faroe Islands and Seychelles studies, and lower in magnitude than the estimate for the New Zealand study. Sensitivity analyses produce similar results, with the IQ coefficient central estimate ranging from -0.13 to -0.25.CONCLUSIONS: IQ is a useful end point for estimating neurodevelopmental effects, but may not fully represent cognitive deficits associated with mercury exposure, and does not represent deficits related to attention and motor skills. Nevertheless, the integrated IQ coefficient provides a more robust description of the dose-response relationship for prenatal mercury exposure and cognitive functioning than results of any single study.

Process-based mathematical models are valuable tools for informing such decisions, because measurement data often are sparse and cannot be extrapolated to investigate the environmental impacts of different policy options. Here, we bring together previously developed and evaluated modeling frameworks for watersheds, water bodies, and food web bioaccumulation of mercury. We use these models to investigate the timescales required for mercury levels in predatory fish to change in response to altered mercury inputs. We model declines in water, sediment, and fish mercury concentrations across five ecosystems spanning a range of physical and biological conditions, including a farm pond, a seepage lake, a stratified lake, a drainage lake, and a coastal plain river. Results illustrate that temporal lags are longest for watershed-dominated systems (like the coastal plain river) and shortest for shallow water bodies (like the seepage lake) that receive most of their mercury from deposition directly to the water surface. All ecosystems showed responses in two phases: A relatively rapid initial decline in mercury concentrations (20-60% of steady-state values) over one to three decades, followed by a slower descent lasting for decades to centuries. Response times are variable across ecosystem types and are highly affected by sediment burial rates and active layer depths in systems not dominated by watershed inputs. Additional research concerning watershed processes driving mercury dynamics and empirical data regarding sediment dynamics in freshwater bodies are critical for improving the predictive capability of process-based mercury models used to inform regulatory decisions.

We linked monitoring data for PM ! 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) to infants born in California in 1999 and 2000 using maternal addresses for mothers who lived within 5 miles of a PM2.5 monitor. We matched each postneonatal infant death to four infants surviving to I year of age, by birth weight category and date of birth (within 2 weeks). For each matched set, we calculated exposure as the average PM2.5 concentration over the period of life for the infant who died. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds of postneonatal all-cause, respiratory-related, SIDS, and external-cause (a control category) mortality by exposure to PM2.5, controlling for the matched sets and maternal demographic factors. We matched 788 postneonatal infant deaths to 3,089 infant survivors, with 51 and 120 postneonatal deaths due to respiratory causes and SIDS, respectively.

This part of the study evaluated physiological associations with blood Hg in young snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), and organ biochemistry and histopathological effects in snowy egrets on Lahontan Reservoir (LR) from the period 2002-2006. LR snowy egret geometric mean total Hg concentrations (mu g/g ww) ranged from 1.5 to 4.8 for blood, 2.4 to 3.1 liver, 1.8 to 2.5 kidneys, 1.7 to 2.4 brain, and 20.5 to 36.4 feathers over these years. For night-herons, mean Hg for blood ranged from 1.6 to 7.4. Significant positive correlations were found between total Hg in blood and five plasma enzyme activities of snowy egrets suggesting hepatic stress. Histopathological findings revealed vacuolar changes in hepatocytes in LR snowy egrets as well as correlation of increased liver inflammation with increasing blood and tissue Hg. Hepatic oxidative effects were manifested by decreased hepatic total thiol concentration and glutathione reductase activity and elevated hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive subatances (TBARS), a measure of lipid peroxidation. However, other hepatic changes indicated compensatory mechanisms in response to oxidative stress, including decreased oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentration and decreased ratio of GSSG to reduced glutathione. In young black-crowned night-herons, fewer correlations were apparent. In both species, positive correlations between blood total Hg and plasma uric acid and inorganic phosphorus were suggestive of renal stress, which was supported by histopathological findings. Both oxidative effects and adaptive responses to oxidative stress were apparent in kidneys and brain. Vacuolar change and inflammation in peripheral nerves were found to correlate with blood and tissue Hg. Hg-associated effects related to the immune system included alterations in specific white blood cells and lymphoid depletion in the bursa that were correlated with blood and tissue Hg. When the number of plasma variables that differed between young snowy egrets from the LR site and the reference site were compared between wet and drought years, over twice as many variables were affected during drought years. This resulted in many more variables correlating with blood total Hg during dry than during wet years, suggesting the combination of drought and Hg was more stressful than Hg alone. Drought may have exacerbated Hg-related effects as reported previously for overall productivity. This relationship was not evident in black-crowned night-herons, although data were more limited.

Investigations into the transfer and fate of Hg have focused on inhabitants of freshwater aquatic ecosystems, as these are the habitats at greatest risk for methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnification. Deviating from such an approach, we documented MeHg availability in a terrestrial montane ecosystem using a suite of insectivorous passerines. Intensive and extensive sampling of Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli) indicated significant heterogeneity in MeHg availability across 21 mountaintops in northeastern North America. Southern parts of the breeding range tended to be at greater risk than northern parts. Mean blood Hg concentrations for Bicknell's thrush at 21 distinct breeding sites ranged from 0.08 to 0.38 ug/g (ww) and at seven Greater Antillean wintering sites ranged from 0.03 to 0.42 ug/g (ww). Overall concentrations were significantly greater in wintering than in breeding areas. Mercury exposure profiles for four passerine species on Mt. Mansfield, Vermont indicated greatest MeHg uptake in Bicknell's thrush and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) and lowest in blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata) and white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). The MeHg and total Hg ratio in blood in these four species was nearly 1:1. There was no correlation between blood and feather Hg concentrations in breeding Bicknell's thrush, in part because of apparent retention of winter Hg body burdens, within-season variation of MeHg availability, and confounding factors such as influences from age. Adult thrushes had significantly higher concentrations of feather Hg than did young-of-the-year. Although individual patterns of inter-year feather Hg concentrations were disordered, some individuals exhibited bioaccumulation of MeHg. Female blood Hg concentrations were significantly lower than males', in part because females have additional depurating mechanisms through eggs. Older male Bicknell's thrushes that breed in New England are therefore likely at greatest risk. Mechanisms for Hg methylation in montane areas without standing water are not yet fully understood. However, recent studies indicate that MeHg is present in forest tree leaves and leaf detritus; saturated soils and other moist microhabitats may also contribute to MeHg availability. Our finding of a correlation between regional litterfall Hg flux patterns and Bicknell's thrush blood Hg concentrations demonstrates on-site availability of MeHg. Further investigations into MeHg availability in montane environments are recommended to assess risk to insectivorous passerines, particularly the Bicknell's thrush.

In the present study, we examined blood and fur Hg concentrations as well as the adrenocortical responses of insectivorous big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) near the Hg-contaminated South River, VA and a nearby reference area. Baseline glucocorticoids and adrenocortical responses to handling have been widely used to assess the influence of environmental stressors because plasma glucocorticoids rise in response to various physical, psychological, and physiological challenges. Female bats captured at the contaminated site had 2.6 times higher blood and fur Hg concentrations than those captured at the reference site (blood: 0.11 vs. 0.04 mu g/g wet weight; fur: 28.0 vs. 10.9 mu g/g fresh weight). Fur Hg concentrations at the contaminated site were higher than most wild omnivorous and carnivorous mammals reported in the literature. Although fur and blood Hg concentrations were tightly correlated, fur Hg concentrations averaged 260 times higher than concentrations in blood. This suggests that fur may be an important depuration route for bats, just as it is in other mammals.

Here we examined the associations between Hg and endocrine function (adrenocortical responses and plasma thyroid hormone concentrations) of insectivorous tree swallow nestlings adjacent to a Hg-contaminated river and nearby reference rivers in Virginia. Nestlings from the contaminated sites had blood Hg concentrations that exceeded those from the reference sites by more than an order of magnitude (354 +/- 22 vs 17 +/- 1 ppb wet weight). A regression of age and Hg concentrations suggested dietary Hg at the contaminated sites exceeded the nestlings' capacity to eliminate Hg through deposition into growing feathers. Although blood Hg concentrations among nestlings at the contaminated sites were lower than those typically associated with abnormal behavior or altered physiology in young birds, adrenocortical responses, plasma triiodothyronine, and thyroxin concentrations were suppressed, relative to reference levels, by the end of the nestling period.

Maternal transfer of bioaccumulated contaminants to offspring may be an important and overlooked mechanism of impaired reproductive success that affects amphibian populations. Mercury (Hg) is of particular concern due to its ubiquity in the environment, known toxicity to other wildlife, and complex relationships with other elements, such as selenium (Se). The objectives of the present study were to describe the relationships between total Hg (THg), methlymercury (MM Hg), and Se in three amphibian species (Plethmlon cinereus, Eurycea bislineata cirrigera, and Bufo americanus) along a Hg-polluted river and floodplain, and to determine if B. americanus maternally transfers Hg and Se to its eggs in a tissue residue-dependent manner. Total Hg and MMHg concentrations in all species spanned two orders of magnitude between the reference and contaminated areas, while Sc concentrations were generally low in all species at both sites. Strong positive relationships between THg and MMHg in tissues of all species were observed throughout. Both Hg and Sc were maternally transferred from females to eggs in B. americanus, but the percentage of the females' Hg body burden transferred to eggs was low compared with Sc. In addition, Hg concentrations appeared to positively influence the amount of Sc transferred from female to eggs. The present study is the first to confirm a correlation between Hg concentrations in female carcass and eggs in amphibians and among the first to describe co-transference of Se and Hg in an anamniotic vertebrate. The results suggest future work is needed to determine whether maternal transfer of Hg has transgenerational implications for amphibian progeny. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:989-997.

DuPont de Nemours; Virginia Polytechnic and State University; National Science Foundation; The World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission Amphibian Specialist Group,"Mercury (Hg) is an important environmental contaminant due to its global distribution, tendency to bioaccumulate, and toxicity in wildlife. However, Hg has received little attention in amphibians compared to other vertebrates. Amphibians vary widely in life history strategies and feeding ecologies, which could influence Hg exposure and accumulation. To determine whether species and life stage affects Hg bioaccumulation, adults from three species (Plethodon cinereus, Eutycea bislineata, and Bubo americanus) and larvae from the latter two species were collected along a contamination gradient on the South River (VA, USA). Total Hg (THg) concentrations in the contaminated site were 3.5 to 22 times higher than in the reference site. Differences were found in THg concentrations. in amphibians that were consistent with their habitat requirements and feeding preferences. In general, adults (3,453 +/- 196 ng/g, dry mass) and larvae (2,479 +/- 171 ng/g) of the most river-associated species, E. bislineata, had the highest THg concentrations, followed by B. americanus tadpoles (2,132 +/- 602 ng/g), whereas adults of the more terrestrial B. americanus (598 +/- 117 ng/g) and P. cinereus (583 +/- 178 ng/g) had the lowest concentrations. In addition, nondestructive sampling techniques were developed. For the salamander species, THg concentrations in tail tissue were strongly correlated (r >= 0.97) with the remaining carcass. A strong positive correlation (r=0.92) also existed between blood and whole-body THg concentrations in B. americanus. These results suggest that amphibians and their terrestrial predators may be at risk of Hg exposure in this system and that nondestructive methods may be a viable sampling alternative that reduces impacts to local populations.

However, little is known about the effects of mercury contamination on health of free-living vertebrate populations. The South River in Virginia, USA was heavily contaminated with industrial mercury from 1929 to 1950, and recent studies have documented high levels of circulating mercury in riparian songbirds breeding below the site of contamination. Here we used two standardized immune assays, mitogen-induced swelling in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), to test for effects of mercury toxicity on the immune system of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) which feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects along the contaminated waterway. We found that females breeding at mercury-contaminated sites mounted significantly weaker PHA-induced swelling responses than those at reference sites in both years of study. However, among females on the contaminated sites, individual bloodstream mercury concentration did not predict the extent of mitogen-induced swelling. We did not detect any differences between reference and contaminated females in the strength of antibody responses to SRBCs, but sample sizes for this assay were significantly smaller. Overall, our results suggest that mercury toxicity can exert sub-lethal immunosuppression in free-living, insectivorous songbirds. The potential fitness consequences of the detected differences in immunocompetence caused by mercury toxicity warrant further study.

However, mechanisms regulating the formation of meHg, its initial incorporation at the base of pelagic food chains, and its subsequent trophic transfer remain controversial. Here we use field data from 15 northern Wisconsin lakes, equilibrium aqueous speciation modeling, and statistical modeling to revisit several hypotheses about the uptake, distribution, and fate of inorganic Hg (Hg-II) and meHg in aquatic biota. Our field data comprise determinations of total Hg (Hg-T) and meHg in surface waters, sediments, microseston, zooplankton, and small fish in each of the study lakes. For these lake waters, strong positive correlations between DOC and aqueous concentrations of mercury along with negative correlations between DOC and the seston-water partitioning of mercury indicate that organic ligands bind Hg-II and meHg strongly enough to dominate their apparent aqueous speciation. In the microseston, zooplankton and fish, meHg concentrations and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) increased with increasing trophic level while biotic concentrations of Hg-II decreased - indicating that meHg was indeed the biomagnified species of mercury. For ail trophic levels, meHg concentrations varied positively with the calculated aqueous concentration of meHg(+) (free ion), especially when coupled with pH, or meHgOH (hydroxide) species but not with meHgCl(0), the neutral chloride complex. These findings suggest that: (1) the passive uptake of meHg does not control bioaccumulation at the base of aquatic food webs in nature (i.e. phyto- and bacterioplankton); (2) correlation with pH and DOC largely reflect the supply and bioavailability of meHg to lower trophic levels; and (3) meHg concentrations at higher trophic levels reflect uptake at low trophic levels and other factors, such as diet and growth. Low concentrations of meHg in surficial sediments indicate that the fates of biotic Hg-II and meHg are different. Most biotic meHg is demethylated rather than buried in lake sediments.

In wetland/forest watersheds, elevated Hg-T fluxes were associated with the filtered phase, while in agricultural watersheds, increased Hg-T fluxes were due to particle loading. Monomethylmercury (MeHg) yields from wetland/forest sites were higher than agricultural/forest sites and agricultural only sites.

In an experimentally manipulated lake, both acidification and trophic position enhanced the bioaccumulation of methyl-Hg in the plankton. A consistant pattern of methyl-Hg enrichment (2-4 x) in water, bulk phytoplankton, and individual zooplankton was associated with a 1. 5 unit pH decrease in Little Rock Lake. Regardless of pH, bioconcentration factors [Bf = log(Cb/Cw), where Cb and Cw are Hg concentrations in biota and water] were substantially higher for methyl-Hg than those for total Hg or nonmethyl-Hg at three pelagic trophic levels (approximately 10-100x). Between each trophic level, the Bf(methyl-Hg) increased by approximately 0.5 log units, clearly indicating biomagnification. Although somewhat higher in the acidified basin, Bf(methyl-Hg) was more strongly influenced by trophic position than by pH. This suggests that methyl-Hg was bioaccumulated largely in proportion to supply and that acidification may have directly increased supply to the base of the food chain.

We compared results with pooled estimates from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), a time-series study of 95 large U.S. urban centers from 1987 to 2000.Results: Both meta-analysis and NMMAPS results provided strong evidence of a short-term association between ozone and mortality, with larger effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, the elderly, and current-day ozone exposure. In both analyses, results were insensitive to adjustment for particulate matter and model specifications.

Several findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS; meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger than with NMMAPS.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-today variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.Objective To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.Design and Setting Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.Main Outcome Measure Daily counts of total non-injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.Results A 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day's exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.Conclusions These results indicate a statistically significant association between short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban communities, which include about 40% of the total US population. The findings indicate that this widespread pollutant adversely affects public health.

But are the methods appropriate for measuring costs and benefits for decisions that will have impacts 20 to 30 years from now the right ones to employ for a future that lies 200 to 300 years in the future? This landmark book argues that methods reasonable for measuring gains and losses for a generation into the future may not be appropriate when applied to a longer span of time. Paul Portney and John Weyant have assembled some of the world's foremost economists to reconsider the purpose, ethical implications, and application of discounting in light of recent research and current policy concerns. These experts note reasons why conventional calculations involved in discounting are undermined when considering costs and benefits in the distant future, including uncertainty about the values and preferences of future generations, and uncertainties about available technologies. Rather than simply disassemble current methodologies, the contributors examine innovations that will make discounting a more compelling tool for policy choices that influence the distant future.

The analyses involved aggregate linear regression and logistic regression of US FARS fatal accident data, state accident data, and vehicle registration data, using methods based on or adapted from methods described in published NHTSA Technical Reports. The results indicate that 1) reduced vehicle curb weight would decrease the total number of fatalities (including occupants of other collision partners and vulnerable road users), 2) reduced vehicle wheelbase and/or track would increase the total number of fatalities, and 3) that the effect on fatalities of reduced vehicle curb weight, wheelbase, and track according to the trends among these three variables in the 1985 to 1998 model year cars and 1985 to 1997 model year LTVs is small because the opposing effects of these variables tend to cancel each other.

The proposed program is designed to encourage the blending of renewable fuels into the U.S. motor vehicle fuels.  Wider use of renewable fuels will result in less oil U.S. consumption and less U.S. oil imports. This study investigates the energy security benefits of reduced U.S. oil consumption and imports. A range of approaches have been developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for evaluating the social costs and energy security implications of oil use, and for evaluating policy measures that alter the U.S consumption and imports of oil.   To help estimate the energy security benefits of the RFS, we updated and applied the method used in the 1997 report Oil Imports: An Assessment of Benefits and Costs, by Leiby, Jones, Curlee and Lee.1 This approach estimates the marginal benefits to society, in dollars per barrel, of reducing oil U.S imports.2 The “oil premium” approach emphasizes identifying those energy-security related costs which are not reflected in the market price of oil, and which are expected to change in response to an incremental change in the level of oil imports.  Since the 1997 publication of this report changes in oil market conditions, both current and projected, suggest that the magnitude of the oil premium may have changed.  Significant driving factors that were revised or reconsidered include: oil prices, current and anticipated levels of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production, U.S. import levels, potential OPEC behavior and responses, Strategic Petroleum Reserve levels, and disruption likelihoods. We apply the most recently available careful quantitative assessment of disruption likelihoods, from the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum’s 2005 workshop series,3 as well as other assessments.  We also revisit the issue of the macroeconomic consequences of oil market disruptions and sustained higher oil prices.  Using the oil premium calculation methodology which combines short-run and long-run costs and benefits, and accounting for uncertainty in the key driving factors, we provide an updated range of estimates of the marginal energy security benefits of reducing U.S. oil imports. The oil import premium is an informative measure of long-standing interest, but is not intended to provide complete guidance on oil security policy.  The oil premium is not a measure of the full social costs of oil imports or use, or the full magnitude of the oil dependence and security problem.  Rather, it is a measure of the quantifiable per-barrel economic costs which the U.S. could avoid by a small-to-moderate reduction in oil imports.  The premium does not estimate the value of introducing a radical new technology, which may entail a major shift in supply or demand curves, or a substantial change in the long-run or short-run flexibility of supply or demand.  As estimated, it is most consistent with the benefits of contracting domestic demand or expanding domestic supply along the existing demand and supply curves through conventional market incentives.  Finally, an estimated oil import premium of $5, $10, or $20 per barrel does not mean that a tax or tariff of that magnitude is recommended as the best policy, nor that the imposition of such a tax alone would completely solve the energy security problem and eliminate the need for any other policy.  The multifaceted nature of the costs measured by the import premium suggests pursuing a combination of policies targeting key aspects of the problem.  Helpful policies would promote more competitive oil supply in the long-run and short-run by diminishing the profitability and power of cartelized oil supply.  They would also reduce the economy’s vulnerability to oil shocks by increasing short-run supply/demand flexibility, promoting supplyregion stability, developing buffer stocks and diminishing the economy’s reliance on fuels with unstable supply.",Non-Government Report,Docket EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–04722060-AP58,,12,"Estimating the Energy Security Benefits of Reduced U.S. Oil Imports",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,,"Leiby, Paul N",,,,,,Non-Government Report,"http://pzl1.ed.ornl.gov/ energysecurity.html (click on link below ‘‘Oil Imports Costs and Benefits’’) "2060-AP58,,12,"Evaluating U.S. Fuel Economy Standards In a Model with Producer and Household Heterogeneity",University of California at San Diego,,"Jacobsen, Mark",,2012,,,"This paper employs an empirically estimated model to study the equilibrium effects of an increase in the U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards.  A distinguishing feature of the model is that it considers the fact that some firms are unconstrained by CAFE regulation, while others choose either to violate the regulation (pay a fine) or to meet the standard.  By taking this heterogeneity into account, I find that the profit impacts of CAFE fall almost entirely on domestic producers.  In addition, the model develops utility-consistent welfare analyses that allow direct comparison of the CAFE standard with gasoline taxes, considering the simultaneous household decision of vehicle and miles traveled.  Finally, the model accounts for the dynamic effects of CAFE on used vehicle markets – effects that turn out to be important to the welfare impacts. The surplus changes in used car markets make up nearly half of the gross welfare costs of the CAFE standard.  These effects fall disproportionately on low-income households.

The synergism equaled or exceeded that reported for the effects of interleukin 1, interleukin 3, or interleukin 6 with GM-CSF. Optimal enhancement was obtained with 1 microM HQ and was largely independent of the concentration of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment with other authentic benzene metabolites, phenol and catechol, and the putative metabolite trans, trans-muconaldehyde did not enhance growth factor response. Coadministration of phenol and HQ did not enhance the maximal rGM-CSF response obtained with HQ alone but shifted the optimal concentration to 100 pM. Synergism between HQ and rGM-CSF was observed with nonadherent bone marrow cells and lineage-depleted bone marrow cells, suggesting an intrinsic effect on recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells not normally responsive to rGM-CSF.

Samuel McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment at the University of Ottawa,"Context Associations have been found between day-to-day particulate air pollution and increased risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiopulmonary mortality, However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive. Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.  Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.   Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality. ",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP58,,12,"Effects of VOCs on herbaceous plants in an open-top chamber experiment",Environmental Pollution,0269-7491,"Cape, JN; Leith, ID; Binnie, J; Content, J; Donkin, M; Skewes, M; Price, DN; Brown, AR; Sharpe, AD",10.1016/S0269-7491(02)00464-5,2003,"Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Bush Estate, Penicuik, Midlothian, UK; University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK; Brixham Environmental Laboratory, AstraZeneca Global Safety Health and Environment, Freshwater Quarry, Brixham, UK","AstraZeneca Global Safety Health and Environment; Brixham Environmental Laboratory, UK","A selection of herbaceous plants representing the ground flora around a typical chemical installation in the UK was exposed continuously for 7 weeks to a mixture of six VOCs (acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, ethanol, methyl t-butyl ether and toluene) in open-top chambers.

The effects of continuous exposure, representing a worst-case, were measured in terms of uncontrolled water loss from leaves, leaf wettability, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, dry matter production and detailed observations of changes in plant growth and phenology. There were significant effects of VOC exposure on seed production, leaf water content and photosynthetic efficiency in some plant species. Such effects may be detectable in vegetation close to major industrial point sources of VOCs, or as a result of an accidental release of material during manufacture or transport. Some of the species tested e.g. birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) seem to be promising as potential bioindicators for VOCs, but there may be other even more sensitive species waiting to be discovered. However, the most obvious and conveniently measured response to VOC exposure in the birdsfoot trefoil (premature senescence i.e. advanced timing of seed pod production) could easily be confused in the field with climatic influences.

In a sample of 263 nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women, we evaluated the effects on birth outcomes of prenatal exposure to airborne PAHs monitored during pregnancy by personal air sampling, along with ETS estimated by plasma cotinine, and an organophosphate pesticide (OP) estimated by plasma chlorpyrifos (CPF). Plasma CPF was used as a covariate because it was the most often detected in plasma and was highly correlated with other pesticides frequently detected in plasma. Among African Americans, high prenatal exposure to PAHs was associated with lower birth weight (p = 0.003) and smaller head circumference (p = 0.01) after adjusting for potential confounders. CPF was associated with decreased birth weight and birth length overall (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, respectively) and with lower birth weight among African Americans (p = 0.04) and reduced birth length in Dominicans (p < 0.001), and was therefore included as a covariate in the model with PAH. After controlling for CPF, relationships between PAHs and birth outcomes were essentially unchanged. In this analysis, PAHs and CPF appear to be significant independent determinants of birth outcomes. Further analyses of pesticides will be carried out.

In a sample of 263 nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women, we evaluated the effects on birth outcomes of prenatal exposure to airborne PAHs monitored during pregnancy by personal air sampling, along with ETS estimated by plasma cotinine, and an organophosphate pesticide (OP) estimated by plasma chlorpyrifos (CPF). Plasma CPF was used as a covariate because it was the most often detected in plasma and was highly correlated with other pesticides frequently detected in plasma. Among African Americans, high prenatal exposure to PAHs was associated with lower birth weight (p = 0.003) and smaller head circumference (p = 0.01) after adjusting for potential confounders. CPF was associated with decreased birth weight and birth length overall (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, respectively) and with lower birth weight among African Americans (p = 0.04) and reduced birth length in Dominicans (p < 0.001), and was therefore included as a covariate in the model with PAH. After controlling for CPF, relationships between PAHs and birth outcomes were essentially unchanged. In this analysis, PAHs and CPF appear to be significant independent determinants of birth outcomes. Further analyses of pesticides will be carried out. Possible explanations of the failure to find a significant effect of PAHs in the Hispanic subsample are discussed.

Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates.

In the National Cancer Institute's formaldehyde cohort, previously followed through December 31, 1979, and updated through December 31, 1994, formaldehyde exposure was associated with an increased risk for leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, that increased with peak and average intensity of exposure.  We extended follow-up through December 31, 2004 (median follow-up = 42 years), for 25 619 workers employed at one of 10 formaldehyde-using or formaldehyde-producing plants before 1966. We used Poisson regression to calculate relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine associations between quantitative formaldehyde exposure estimates (peak exposure, average intensity and cumulative exposure) and death from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered to be significant at P = .05.  When follow-up ended in 2004, there were statistically significant increased risks for the highest vs lowest peak formaldehyde exposure category (>= 4 parts per million [ppm] vs > 0 to < 2.0 ppm) and all lymphohematopoietic malignancies (RR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.81, P trend = .02) and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 3.96; 95% CI = 1.31 to 12.02, P trend = .01). Statistically nonsignificant associations were observed for multiple myeloma (RR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.01 to 4.12, P trend > .50), all leukemia (RR = 1.42; 95% CI = 0.92 to 2.18, P trend = .12), and myeloid leukemia (RR = 1.78; 95% CI = 0.87 to 3.64, P trend = .13). There was little evidence of association for any lymphohematopoietic malignancy with average intensity or cumulative exposure at the end of follow-up in 2004. However, disease associations varied over time. For peak exposure, the highest formaldehyde-related risks for myeloid leukemia occurred before 1980, but trend tests attained statistical significance in 1990 only. After the mid-1990s, the formaldehyde-related risk of myeloid leukemia declined.  Evaluation of risks over time suggests a possible link between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia but also perhaps Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Observed patterns could be due to chance but are also consistent with a causal association within the relatively short induction-incubation periods characteristic of leukemogenesis.

Although increased risks for leukemia have been found in medical workers and other professionals exposed to formaldehyde, studies in industrial workers, who are thought to have higher exposures, have shown inconsistent associations. We extended follow-up of a cohort of industrial workers to evaluate the association between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic cancers. Methods: The cohort consisted of 25 619 workers (865 708 person-years) employed before January 1, 1966, at one of 10 U.S. industrial plants and followed through December 31, 1994. We analyzed formaldehyde exposure (peak exposure, average exposure intensity, cumulative exposure, and duration of exposure) and mortality from lymphohematopoietic malignancies using standardized mortality ratios and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Poisson regression. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among the cohort, there were 178 deaths from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. Relative risks for leukemia (69 deaths), particularly for myeloid leukemia (30 deaths), increased with formaldehyde exposure. Compared with workers exposed to low peak levels of formaldehyde (0.1-1.9 ppm), relative risks for myeloid leukemia were 2.43 (95% CI = 0.81 to 7.25) and 3.46 (95% CI = 1.27 to 9.43) for workers exposed to peak levels of 2.0-3.9 ppm and greater than or equal to4.0 ppm, respectively (P-trend =.009). Compared with workers exposed to low levels of average exposure intensity of formaldehyde (0.1-0.4 ppm), workers exposed to 0.5-0.9 ppm and greater than or equal to1.0 ppm average intensity had relative risks of 1.15 (95% CI = 0.41 to 3.23) and 2.49 (95% CI = 1.03 to 6.03), respectively (P-trend =.088). The relative risk for leukemia was not associated with cumulative exposure but was weakly associated with duration of exposure. Relative risks for Hodgkin's disease also increased with formaldehyde exposure. Conclusions: Exposure to formaldehyde may cause leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, in humans.

Our data are from semi-structured interviews with 57 households across nine lifestyle..sectors."" We found no household that analyzed their fuel costs in a systematic way in their automobile or gasoline, purchases. Almost none of these households track gasoline costs over time or consider them explicitly in household budgets. These households may know the cost of their last tank of gasoline and the unit price of gasoline on that day, but this accurate information is rapidly forgotten and replaced by typical information. One effect of this lack of knowledge and information is that when consumers buy a vehicle, they do not have the basic building blocks of knowledge assumed by the model of economically rational decision-making, and they make large errors estimating gasoline costs and savings over time. Moreover, we find that consumer value for fuel economy is not only about private cost savings. Fuel economy can be a symbolic value as well, for example among drivers who view resource conservation or thrift as important values to communicate. Consumers also assign non-monetary meaning to fuel prices, for example seeing rising prices as evidence of conspiracy. This research suggests that consumer responses to fuel economy technology and changes in fuel prices are more complex than economic assumptions suggest.

Pretreatment with hydroquinone (HQ) at concentrations ranging from picomolar to micromolar for 30 min resulted in a 1.5- to 4.6-fold enhancement in colonies formed in response to rGM-CSF that was due to an increase in granulocyte/macrophage colonies. The synergism equaled or exceeded that reported for the effects of interleukin 1, interleukin 3, or interleukin 6 with GM-CSF. Optimal enhancement was obtained with 1-mu-M HQ and was largely independent of the concentration of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment with other authentic benzene metabolites, phenol and catechol, and the putative metabolite trans,trans-muconaldehyde did not enhance growth factor response. Coadministration of phenol and HQ did not enhance the maximal rGM-CSF response obtained with HQ alone but shifted the optimal concentration to 100 pM. Synergism between HQ and rGM-CSF was observed with nonadherent bone marrow cells and lineage-depleted bone marrow cells, suggesting an intrinsic effect on recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells not normally responsive to rGM-CSF.

The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation. This paper describes the Models-3 CMAQ system, its governing equations, important science algorithms, and a few application examples.

The contribution of air pollution to atherosclerosis that underlies many cardiovascular diseases h as not been investigated. Animal data suggest that ambient particulate matter (PM) may contribute to atherogenesis. We used data on 798 participants from two clinical trials to investigate the association between atherosclerosis and long-term exposure to ambient PM up to 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Baseline data included assessment of the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. We geocoded subjects' residential areas to assign annual mean concentrations of ambient PM2.5. Exposure values were assigned from a PM2.5 surface derived from a geostatistical model. Individually assigned annual mean PM2.5 Concentrations ranged from 5.2 to 26.9 mug/m(3) (mean, 20.3). For a cross-sectional exposure contrast of 10 mug/m(3) PM2.5, CIMT increased by 5.9% (95% confidence interval, 1-11%). Adjustment for age reduced the coefficients, but further adjustment for covariates indicated robust estimates in the range of 3.9-4.3% (p-values, 0.05-0.1). Among older subjects (greater than or equal to 60 years of age), women, never smokers, and those reporting lipid-lowering treatment at baseline, the associations of PM2.5 and CIMT were larger with the strongest associations in women greater than or equal to 60 years of age (15.7%, 5.7-26.6%). These results represent the first epidemiologic evidence of an association between atherosclerosis and ambient air pollution. Given the leading role of cardiovascular disease as a cause of death and the large populations exposed to ambient PM2.5, these findings may be important and need further confirmation.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP58,,12,"The influence of location, source, and emission type in estimates of the human health benefits of reducing a ton of air pollution",Air Qual Atmos Health ,1873-9318,"Fann, N",10.1007/s11869-009-0044-0,2009,US Environmental Protection Agency,,"The benefit per ton ($/ton) of reducing PM2.5 varies by the location of the emission reduction, the type of source emitting the precursor, and the specific precursor controlled. This paper examines how each of these factors influences the magnitude of the $/ton estimate. We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP58,,6,The economics of climate change,The American Economic Review,0002-8282 ,"Stern, N",10.1257/aer.98.2.1,8-May,World Bank,,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AP58,,12,The economics of climate change,The American Economic Review 98(2):1–37,0002-8282 ,"Stern, Nicholas",10.1257/aer.98.2.1,2008,World Bank,,,Scholarly Journal,2060-AP58,,12,"Vehicle Survivability and Travel Mileage Schedules","NHTSA, Regulatory Analysis and Evaluation Division",,"Lu, S",,2006,,,,Technical report,http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809952.pdf 2060-AP58,,12,Reduce Climate Change,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department on Energy,,"Podesta, Ladislaw, DeCicco",,,,,,Web Page,www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/climate.shtml 2060-AP58,,12,Why is Fuel Economy Important?,"Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency",,,,,,,,Web Page,http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/why.shtml2060-AP58,,12,"Final Report: Third Peer Review of the CMAQ Model",,,"Aiyyer, A., Cohan, D., Russell, A., Stockwell, W., Tanrikulu, S., Vizuete, W., Wilczak",,2007,,,,,2060-AP58,,12,The Impact of Safety Standards and Behavioral Trends on Motor Vehicle Fatality Rates,,,"Blincoe, L. and Shankar, U,",,2007,,,,,2060-AP58 ,,12,The Effects of the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standards in the US,Journal of Industrial Economics 46(1): 1–33,0022-1821,"Goldberg, Pinelopi K",,1998,Princeton University,National Science Foundation; Princeton University,"This paper examines the effects of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE) on automobile sales, prices, and fuel consumption.

Intact spinach chloroplasts oxidize benzene, and this process is strongly stimulated in light. Oxidation of benzene by spinach chloroplasts or by enzyme preparation from spinach leaves is almost completely inhibited by 8-oxyquinoline or sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, and slightly affected by alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. Benzene oxidation by enzyme preparation is significantly stimulated by NADH and NADPH; in their presence, the benzene hydroxylation product, phenol, is formed in a determinable amount.

However, linkages between growth and ambient ozone concentrations in the field are not well established for forest trees. Ambient ozone concentrations have been shown to cause foliar injury on a number of tree species throughout much of the eastern USA. Symptom expression is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors and, therefore, ozone-exposure/tree-response relationships have been difficult to confirm. Clearly defined, cause-effect relationships between visible injury and growth losses due to ozone have not been validated. Generalizations of sensitivity of forest trees to ozone are complicated by tree development stage, microclimate, leaf phenology, compensatory processes, within-species variation and other interacting stresses. In general, decreases in above-ground growth at ambient ozone levels in the eastern USA appear to be in the range of 0-10% per year. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of tree species, with the vast majority of studies involving individual tree seedlings in a non-competitive environment. Comparative studies of small and large trees indicate that seedlings are not suitable surrogates for predicting responses of mature trees to ozone. Process-level modelling is a promising methodology that has been recently utilized to assess ozone effects on a stand to regional scale, indicating that ozone is affecting forest growth in the eastern USA. The extent and magnitude of the response is variable and depends on many edaphic and climatic factors. It is imperative when conducting assessment exercises, however, that forest biologists constantly keep in mind the tremendous variability that exists within natural systems. Scaling of single site/physiological response phenomena from an individual tree to an ecosystem and/or region necessitates further research.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP61,,1,Medical Costs of Coronary Artery Disease in the United States,American Journal of Cardiology,0002-9149,"Wittels, EH; Hay, JW; Gotto, AM",10.1016/0002-9149(90)90806-C,15-Feb-90,Baylor College of Medicine; Stanford University,"Merck, Sharp & Dohme",,Scholarly Journal,2060-AP61,,1,Respiratory Health and PM10 Pollution: A Daily Time Series Analysis,American Review of Respiratory Disease,1073-449X,"Pope, CA; Dockery, DW; Spengler, JD; Raizenne, ME",,Sep-91,"Brigham Young University; Harvard School of Public Health; Channing Laboratory, Harvard Medical School; Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Canada","Brigham Young University Faculty Development grant; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Department of National Health and Welfare, Canada","This study evaluated changes in respiratory health associated with daily changes in fine particulate pollution (PM10).

The goal of this study was to examine the characteristics of public schools (grades K-12) in California (n = 7,460) by proximity to major roads. We determined maximum daily traffic counts for all roads within 150 m of the school using a statewide road network and a geographic information system. Statewide, 173 schools (2.3%) with a total enrollment of 150,323 students were located within 150 m of high-traffic roads (greater than or equal to 50,000 vehides/day); 536 schools (7.2%) were within 150 m of medium-traffic roads (25,000-49,999 vehicles/day). Traffic exposure was related to race/ethnicity. For example, the overall percentage of nonwhite students was 78% at the schools located near high-traffic roads versus 60% at the schools with very low exposure (no streets with counted traffic data within 150 m). As the traffic exposure of schools increased, the percentage of both non-Hispanic black and Hispanic students attending the schools increased substantially. Traffic exposure was also related to school-based and census-tract-based socioeconomic indicators, including English language learners. The median percentage of children enrolled in free or reduced-price meal programs increased from 40.7% in the group with very low exposure to 60.5% in the highest exposure group.

Thirty of 47 studies initially identified as potentially relevant met specified inclusion criteria. We extracted or calculated 39 independent estimates of relative risk and derived pooled estimates of risk for all studies and for numerous study subsets by using a random-effects model. We also examined interstudy heterogeneity by using linear metaregressions. Results. There was substantial heterogeneity in the pooled risk estimates for all studies combined and for most subsets. Several factors consistent with higher study quality, however, contributed to increased pooled estimates of risk and lower heterogeneity, including (1) adjustment for confounding by cigarette smoking and other covariates, (2) having a lower likelihood of selection bias, and (3) having increased study power. Conclusion. This analysis provides quantitative support for prior qualitative reviews that have ascribed an etiologic role to occupational diesel exhaust exposure in lung cancer induction. Among study populations most likely to have had substantial exposure to diesel exhaust, the pooled smoking-adjusted relative risk was 1.47 (95% confidence interval = 1.29, 1.67).

Exposure to various environmental factors, including air pollutants and allergens, has been suggested as a partial explanation of these trends. To examine relations between several air pollutants and asthma exacerbation in African Americans, we recruited a panel of 138 children in central Los Angeles. We recorded daily data on respiratory symptoms and medication use for 13 weeks and examined these data in conjunction with data on ozone (O-3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), meteorological variables, pollens, and molds. Using generalized estimating equations, we found associations between respiratory symptom occurrence and several environmental factors. For example, new episodes of cough were associated with exposure to PM10 (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.39; interquartile range [IQR] = 17 mug/m(3), 24-hour average), PM2.5 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03-1.18; IQR = 30 mug/m(3), 12-hour average), NO2, and the molds Cladosporium and Alternaria, but not with exposure to O-3 or pollen.

Exposure concentrations were based on predictions of atmospheric dispersion from a single source, at a distance of approximately 2 km. The effects of continuous exposure, representing a worst-case, were measured in terms of uncontrolled water loss from leaves, leaf wettability, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, dry matter production and detailed observations of changes in plant growth and phenology. There were significant effects of VOC exposure on seed production, leaf water content and photosynthetic efficiency in some plant species. Such effects may be detectable in vegetation close to major industrial point sources of VOCs, or as a result of an accidental release of material during manufacture or transport. Some of the species tested e.g. birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) seem to be promising as potential bioindicators for VOCs, but there may be other even more sensitive species waiting to be discovered. However, the most obvious and conveniently measured response to VOC exposure in the birdsfoot trefoil (premature senescence i.e. advanced timing of seed pod production) could easily be confused in the field with climatic influences. It is also uncertain at this stage whether any of the effects observed would lead to longer term ecological changes in natural plant communities, through biased competition between sensitive and more tolerant species.

The quantitative implications of the rat tumors for human cancer risk are of interest, since epidemiological studies have provided only equivocal evidence that formaldehyde is a human carcinogen. Conolly et al. (Toxicol. Sci. 75, 432-447, 2003) analyzed the rat tumor dose-response assuming that both DNA-reactive and cytotoxic effects of formaldehyde contribute to SCC development. The key elements of their approach were: (1) use of a three-dimensional computer reconstruction of the rat nasal passages and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to predict regional dosimetry of formaldehyde; (2) association of the flux of formaldehyde into the nasal mucosa, as predicted by the CFD model, with formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPX) and with cytolethality/regenerative cellular proliferation (CRCP); and (3) use of a two-stage clonal growth model to link DPX and CRCP with tumor formation. With this structure, the prediction of the tumor dose response was extremely sensitive to cell kinetics. The raw dose-response data for CRCP are J-shaped, and use of these data led to a predicted J-shaped dose response for tumors, notwithstanding a concurrent low-dose-linear, directly mutagenic effect of formaldehyde mediated by DPX. In the present work the modeling approach used by Conolly et al. (ibid.) was extended to humans. Regional dosimetry predictions for the entire respiratory tract were obtained by merging a three-dimensional CFD model for the human nose with a one-dimensional typical path model for the lower respiratory tract. In other respects, the human model was structurally identical to the rat model. The predicted human dose response for DPX was obtained by scale-up of a computational model for DPX calibrated against rat and rhesus monkey data. The rat dose response for CRCP was used ""as is"" for the human model, since no preferable alternative was identified. Three sets of baseline parameter values for the human clonal growth model were obtained through separate calibrations against respiratory tract cancer incidence data for nonsmokers, smokers, and a mixed population of nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Additional risks of respiratory tract cancer were predicted to be negative up to about one ppm for all three cases when the raw CRCP data from the rat were used. When a hockey-stick-shaped model was fit to the rat CRCP data and used in place of the raw data, positive maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of additional risk were obtained. These MLE estimates were lower, for some comparisons by as much as 1,000-fold, than MLE estimates from previous cancer dose-response assessments for formaldehyde. Breathing rate variations associated with different physical activity levels did not make large changes in predicted additional risks. In summary, this analysis of the human implications of the rat SCC data indicates that (1) cancer risks associated with inhaled formaldehyde are de minimis (10(-6) or less) at relevant human exposure levels, and (2) protection from the noncancer effects of formaldehyde should be sufficient to protect from its potential carcinogenic effects.",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Biologically motivated computational modeling of formaldehyde carcinogenicity in the F344 rat,TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES,1096-6080,"Conolly, RB; Kimbell, JS; Janszen, D; et al.",10.1093/toxsci/kfg182,3-Oct,CIIT Centers for Health Research; Wyeth-Ayerst Research; US Environmental Protection Agency,,"Formaldehyde inhalation at 6 ppm and above causes nasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in F344 rats. The human health implications of this effect are of significant interest since human exposure to environmental formaldehyde is widespread, though at lower concentrations than those that cause cancer in rats. In this article, which is part of a larger effort to predict the human cancer risks of inhaled formaldehyde, we describe biologically motivated quantitative modeling of the exposure-tumor response continuum in the rat. An anatomically realistic, three-dimensional fluid dynamics model of the F344 rat nasal airways was used to predict site-specific flux of formaldehyde from inhaled air into tissue, since both SCC and preneoplastic lesions develop in a characteristic site-specific pattern. Flux into tissue was used as a dose metric for two modes of action, direct mutagenicity and cytolethality-regenerative cellular proliferation (CRCP), which in turn were linked to key parameters of a two-stage clonal growth model. The direct mutagenicity mode of action was represented by a low dose linear dose-response model of DNA-protein cross-link (DPX) formation. An empirical J-shaped dose-response model and a threshold model fit to the empirical data were used for CRCP. In the clonal growth model, the probability of mutation per cell generation was a function of the tissue concentration of DPX while the rate of cell division was calculated from the CRCP data. Maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate parameter values. Survivor (a nontumor outcome) and tumor data for controls from the National Toxicology Program database and from two formaldehyde inhalation bioassays were used for likelihood calculations. The J-shaped dose-response for CRCP provided a better description of the SCC data than did the threshold model. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the rodent tumor response is due to the CRCP mode of action, with the directly mutagenic pathway having little, if any, influence.

This study was carried out in response to community concerns about potential health effects of exposure to diesel exhaust particulate (DEP). We measured particulate matter < 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and elemental carbon (EC) on sidewalks and tested whether spatial variations in concentrations were related to local truck traffic density. Ten-hour integrated air samples for EC and PM2.5 were collected for 9 days over a 3-week period in the summer of 1999 at seven geographically distinct intersections. Simultaneous traffic counts were carried out for each sampling event. Traffic was classified into three classes: passenger cars, small trucks, and large trucks (diesel vehicles). Mean diesel vehicle volumes ranged from 9.3 to 276.5 vehicles/hr across sites. Mean EC concentrations by site ranged from 2.6 mug/m(3) at the control site to 7.3 mug/m(3) along a designated truck route. Linear regression of site-specific mean EC concentration on mean large truck counts predicted an increase of 1.69 mug/m(3) EC per 100 large trucks/hr (SE = 0.37; p = 0.01; R-2 = 0.84). Average PM2.5 concentrations by site ranged 1.6-fold (19.0-29.9 mug/m(3)) and were more weakly associated with local traffic. Variations over time for PM2.5 were more pronounced, ranging almost 4-fold (8.9-34.4 mug/m(3)). These results show that airborne EC concentrations, an important component of DEP, are elevated in Hunts Point and that the impact varies across the community as a function of large truck traffic.",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Effect of prenatal exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on neurodevelopment in the first 3 years of life among inner-city children.,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,0091-6765,"Perera, Frederica P.; Rauh, Virginia; Whyatt, Robin M.; et al.",10.1289/ehp.9084,6-Aug,"Columbia University; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, Republic of China; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Southwest Research Institute","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; US Environmental Protection Agency; Educational Foundation of America; Horace W.

Plasma CPF was used as a covariate because it was the most often detected in plasma and was highly correlated with other pesticides frequently detected in plasma. Among African Americans, high prenatal exposure to PAHs was associated with lower birth weight (p = 0.003) and smaller head circumference (p = 0.01) after adjusting for potential confounders.

The hypothesis has been studied almost entirely with respect to traffic-related air pollution. Since derivation of the hypothesis from 2 case-control studies in Denver, USA, two further case-control studies have provided new positive evidence and 4 case-control and 7 ecological studies mainly negative evidence. The 4 case-control studies providing positive evidence were relatively small and tended to have more methodological limitations than those showing no association. Publication bias is possible. The weight or the epidemiological evidence indicates no increased risk for childhood cancer associated with exposure to traffic-related residential air pollution. Nevertheless, the limited number of studies, the methodological limitations of both positive and negative studies and the absence of consistency in the results obviate a firm conclusion of no effect.

However, they did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of this conclusion. Here, we present a limited sensitivity analysis of the formaldehyde human model. We show that when the control animals from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) studies are replaced with control animals only from NTP inhalation studies, estimates of human risk are increased by 50-fold. When only concurrent control rats are used, the model does not provide any upper bound (UB) to human risk. No data went into the model on the effect of formaldehyde on the division rates and death rates of initiated cells. We show that slight numerical perturbations to the Conolly et al. assumptions regarding these rates can be made that are equally consistent with the underlying data used to construct the model, but produce estimates of human risk ranging anywhere from negative up to 10 000 times higher than those deemed by Conolly et al. to be 'conservative'. Thus, we conclude that estimates of human risk by Conolly et al. (2004) are extremely sensitive to modeling assumptions.

Rats were exposed to 0, 250, 1000, or 1500 ppm, and mice were exposed to 0, 50, 250, or 1000 ppm. In addition, another group of rats and mice was exposed to 1000 ppm butadiene so that a comparison could be made between the two compounds. Exposure to 1000 ppm VCH resulted in deaths of all male mice and 5/10 female mice on Test Days 11 or 12. Three additional female mice exposed to 1000 ppm VCH died prior to study completion. The most notable compound-related clinical sign was lethargy observed in the 1500 ppm VCH-exposed rats and 1000 ppm VCH-exposed mice. Male rats exposed to 1500 ppm VCH had significantly lower body weights compared to controls, and male and female rats in the 1500 ppm group had significantly lower body weight gains. None of the VCH-exposed animals or butadiene-exposed rats showed any compound-related hematological effects. However, mice exposed to 1000 ppm butadiene exhibited mild macrocytic anemia. Clinical chemistry evaluation and urinalysis showed no compound-related effects in rats exposed to either VCH or butadiene. Male and female rats exposed to 1000 or 1500 ppm VCH or 1000 ppm butadiene had increased absolute and/or relative liver weights, and male rats in these same exposure groups had increased relative kidney weights. Microscopically, increased accumulation of hyaline droplets was observed in the kidneys of male rats from all VCH exposure groups. Although compound-related, the droplets were not accompanied by cytotoxicity. In mice, the most notable adverse histopathological effect was ovarian atrophy in females exposed to 1000 ppm VCH or 1000 ppm butadiene. The atrophy was slightly more severe in the VCH-exposed females than in the butadiene-exposed females. There were no other compound-related pathological effects in male or female mice exposed to VCH. Additionally, butadiene-exposed male mice had decreased testicular weights, accompanied by slight testicular degeneration and atrophy. For VCH exposure, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level is 1000 ppm for rats based on lethargy and lowered body weights and 250 ppm for mice based on mortality and ovarian atrophy.

Particle exposure concentration was increased during the course of the experiment for carbon black and TiO2 to reach particle lung loads similar to those found in the diesel soot-exposed rats. The average particle exposure concentrations for diesel soot carbon black, and TiO2 were 7, 11.6, and 10 mg/m(3), respectively. Lung tumor rates in these rats increased with increasing cumulative particle exposure (mg/m(3) x h) independent of the type of particle employed. The exposure to 2.5 mg/m(3) diesel soot also induced a significantly increased lung tumor rate, but 0.8 mg/m(3) diesel soot did not. With this study, it could be demonstrated that the carbon core of diesel soot is mainly responsible for the occurrence of diesel engine exhaust-related lung tumors; the role of diesel soot-attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and NO2-PAH is probably of minor importance in the rat lung. Agglomerates of ultrafine carbon and TiO2 particles seem particularly suited to exert toxic effects primarily on alveolar macrophages and alveolar lung particle clearance. Although such lung toxic effects were also seen with the lowest diesel soot exposure concentration (0.8 mg/m(3)) used, no increased lung tumor rate was detected in this group of rats. Whether this result implies a threshold for the particle-related lung tumor induction mechanism as already discussed by Vostal (1986) or whether the tumor effect was simply not observed because of statistical reasons needs further research on the possible mode of action of ultrafine insoluble particles in the lung. NMRI mice that were kept in the same exposure atmospheres (high diesel soot carbon black, TiO2) as the rats did not show an increased lung tumor rate.

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of more than 1 million deaths in 14 U.S. cities. Main results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10-ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% Cl 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months.

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers.Methods: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances.Results: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-mu g/m(3) increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5.Conclusions: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be antici-pated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,1,"PM10, Ozone, and Hospital Admissions For the Elderly in Minneapolis St Paul, Minnesota",Archives of Environmental Health,1933-8244,"Schwartz, J",,Sept-Oct 1994,Harvard School of Public Health,,"Several recent studies have reported associations between airborne particles and/or ozone and hospital admissions for respiratory disease.

Daily counts of admissions, by admit date, were computed for pneumonia (ICD9 480-487) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD9 490-496). Classification was by discharge diagnosis. Daily air pollution data from all monitoring stations for ozone and PM(10) in Minneapolis-St. Paul were obtained, and the daily average for each pollutant was computed. An average of approximately six pneumonia admissions and two admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurred each day. Poisson regression analysis was used to control for time trends, seasonal fluctuations, and weather. PM(10) was a risk factor for pneumonia admissions (relative risk [RR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-1.02) and COPD admissions (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 2.06-1.20). Ozone was also associated with pneumonia admissions (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.36-0.97). The relative risks are for an increase of 100 mu g/m(3) in daily PM(10) and 50 ppb in daily ozone concentration. Several alternative methods for controlling for seasonal patterns and weather were used, including nonparametric regression techniques. The results were not sensitive to the methods. When days exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for either pollutant were excluded, the association remained for both pneumonia (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.34-1.03 for PM(10), and RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.41-0.99 for ozone) and COPD (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 2.06-1.16 for PM(10)).",Scholarly Journal,,Continued by Archives of Environmental & Occupational Health2060-AP61,,1,Short term fluctuations in air pollution and hospital admissions of the elderly for respiratory disease,Thorax,0040-6376,"Schwartz, J",10.1136/thx.50.5.531,May-95,Harvard School of Public Health,,"Background - Several recent studies have reported associations between short term changes in air pollution and respiratory hospital admissions. This relationship was examined in two cities with substantially different levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) but similar levels of airborne particles in an attempt to separate the effects of the two pollutants. Significant differences in weather between the two cities allowed the evaluation of that potential confounder also.Methods - Daily counts of admissions to all hospitals for respiratory disease (ICD 9 460-519) were constructed for persons aged 65 years and older in two cities - New Haven, Connecticut and Tacoma, Washington. Each city was analysed separately. Average daily concentrations of SO2, inhalable particles (PM(10)), and ozone were computed from all monitors in each city, and daily average temperature and humidity were obtained from the US weather service. Daily respiratory admission counts were regressed on temperature, humidity, day of the week indicators, and air pollution. A 19 day weighted moving regression filter was used to remove all seasonal and subseasonal patterns from the data. Possible U-shaped dependence of admissions on temperature was dealt with using indicator variables for eight categories each of temperature and humidity. Each pollutant was first examined individually and then multiple pollutant models were fitted.Results - All three pollutants were associated with respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The PM(10) associations were little changed by control for either ozone or SO2. The ozone association was likewise independent of the other pollutants. The SO2 association was substantially attenuated by control for ozone in both cities, and by control for PM(10) in Tacoma. The magnitude of the effect was small (relative risk 1.06 in New Haven and 1.10 in Tacoma for a 50 mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10), for example) but, given the ubiquitous exposure, this has some public health significance.Conclusions - Air pollution concentrations within current guidelines were associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The strongest evidence for an independent association was for PM(10), followed by ozone. These results are consistent with other studies and suggest that lowering air pollution concentrations would have some impact on public health.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,1,Fine Particles are More Strongly Associated than Coarse Particles with Acute Respiratory Health Effects in Schoolchildren,Epidemiology,1044-3983,"Schwartz, J; Neas, LM",10.1097/00001648-200001000-00004,Jan-00,"Harvard School of Public Health; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School",US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"Numerous studies have reported associations between airborne particles and a range of respiratory outcomes from symptoms to mortality.

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22).

Whether high concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains unknown.Methods and Results - We interviewed 772 patients with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle mass (2.5 mum (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period. In addition, a delayed response associated with 24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of 1.48 associated with an increase of 25 mug/m(3) PM2.5 during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio of 1.69 for an increase of 20 mug/m(3) PM2.5 in the 24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95% CIs 1.09, 2.02 and 1.13, 2.34, respectively).Conclusions - The present study suggests that elevated concentrations of fine particles in the air may transiently elevate the risk of MIs within a few hours and 1 day after exposure.

The monitoring data from such studies is hierarchical by design, imposing a complex covariance structure that must be accounted for in order to obtain unbiased estimates of exposure. Statistical methods such as structural equation modeling (SEM) represent a useful alternative to simple linear regression in these cases, providing simultaneous and unbiased predictions of each level of exposure based on a set of covariates specific to the exposure setting. We test the SEM approach using data from a large exposure assessment of diesel and combustion particles in the U. S. trucking industry. The exposure assessment includes data from 36 different trucking terminals across the United States sampled between 2001 and 2005, measuring PM2.5 and its elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) components, by personal monitoring, and sampling at two indoor work locations and an outdoor ""background"" location. Using the SEM method, we predict the following: (1) personal exposures as a function of work-related exposure and smoking status; (2) work-related exposure as a function of terminal characteristics, indoor ventilation, job location, and background exposure conditions; and ( 3) background exposure conditions as a function of weather, nearby source pollution, and other regional differences across terminal sites. The primary advantage of SEMs in this setting is the ability to simultaneously predict exposures at each of the sampling locations, while accounting for the complex covariance structure among the measurements and descriptive variables. The statistically significant results and high R-2 values observed from the trucking industry application supports the broader use of this approach in exposure assessment modeling.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,Factors influencing the spatial extent of mobile source air pollution impacts: a meta-analysis,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,1471-2458,"Zhou, Ying; Levy, Jonathan I.",10.1186/1471-2458-7-89,7-May,Harvard University,Gilbert and Ildiko Butler Foundation,"Background: There has been growing interest among exposure assessors, epidemiologists, and policymakers in the concept of ""hot spots"", or more broadly, the ""spatial extent"" of impacts from traffic-related air pollutants. This review attempts to quantitatively synthesize findings about the spatial extent under various circumstances.  Methods: We include both the peer-reviewed literature and government reports, and focus on four significant air pollutants: carbon monoxide, benzene, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter ( including both ultrafine particle counts and fine particle mass). From the identified studies, we extracted information about significant factors that would be hypothesized to influence the spatial extent within the study, such as the study type ( e. g., monitoring, air dispersion modeling, GIS-based epidemiological studies), focus on concentrations or health risks, pollutant under study, background concentration, emission rate, and meteorological factors, as well as the study's implicit or explicit definition of spatial extent. We supplement this meta-analysis with results from some illustrative atmospheric dispersion modeling. Results: We found that pollutant characteristics and background concentrations best explained variability in previously published spatial extent estimates, with a modifying influence of local meteorology, once some extreme values based on health risk estimates were removed from the analysis. As hypothesized, inert pollutants with high background concentrations had the largest spatial extent ( often demonstrating no significant gradient), and pollutants formed in near-source chemical reactions ( e. g., nitrogen dioxide) had a larger spatial extent than pollutants depleted in near-source chemical reactions or removed through coagulation processes ( e. g., nitrogen oxide and ultrafine particles). Our illustrative dispersion model illustrated the complex interplay of spatial extent definitions, emission rates, background concentrations, and meteorological conditions on spatial extent estimates even for non-reactive pollutants. Our findings indicate that, provided that a health risk threshold is not imposed, the spatial extent of impact for mobile sources reviewed in this study is on the order of 100 - 400 m for elemental carbon or particulate matter mass concentration ( excluding background concentration), 200 - 500 m for nitrogen dioxide and 100 - 300 m for ultrafine particle counts. Conclusion: First, to allow for meaningful comparisons across studies, it is important to state the definition of spatial extent explicitly, including the comparison method, threshold values, and whether background concentration is included. Second, the observation that the spatial extent is generally within a few hundred meters for highway or city roads demonstrates the need for high resolution modeling near the source. Finally, our findings emphasize that policymakers should be able to develop reasonable estimates of the ""zone of influence"" of mobile sources, provided that they can clarify the pollutant of concern, the general site characteristics, and the underlying definition of spatial extent that they wish to utilize.

Ozone levels were obtained from 22 monitoring stations maintained by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment for the period January 1, 1983 to December 31, 1988. Daily levels of sulfates were recorded at nine monitoring stations representing three different networks operated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada, Positive and statistically significant associations were found between hospital admissions and both ozone and sulfates recorded on the day of admission and up to 3 days prior to the date of admission. Five percent of daily respiratory admissions in the months of May to August were associated with ozone, with sulfates accounting for an additional 1% of these admissions. Ozone was a stronger predictor of admissions than sulfates. Positive and statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations were observed between the ozone-sulfate pollution mix and admissions for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. Positive associations were also found in all age groups, with the largest impact on infants (15% of admissions associated with the ozone-sulfate pollution mix) and the least effects on the elderly (4%). Temperature had no effect on the air pollution-admission relationship. Ozone (lagged 1 day) and sulfates (lagged 1 day) displayed a positive association with respiratory admissions for 91 and 100% of the 168 acute care hospitals, respectively.

The PAH concentration was related to the distance from the source and exhibited a biphasic character, which is interpreted in terms of bimodal distribution of the exhaust microparticles with different rates of deposition. Similarly, the tendency of benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene to decrease their proportion with distance from the highway, in contrast to phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene, and benzo(g,h,i)perylene, was attributed to their prevalent localisation on the heavier particle fraction. The abundance of bacteria (8.33xbackground) and fungi (3.17xbackground) close to the highway is thought to be a consequence of hydrocarbon deposition from the traffic that serves as a significant energetic input into the soil. The elevated concentrations of hydrocarbon substrates, as indicated by PAHs, increased both the absolute and relative numbers of the microbial degraders of diesel fuel, biphenyl, naphthalene, and pyrene. Their maximum numbers at 0.5-1.5 m from the pavement reached 1.3x10(4), 1.2x10(5), 1.1x10(4), and 6.6x10(3) colony-forming units (CFU) or infection units per gramme dry soil, respectively.

In the second stage, we specify a class of distributions for the true city-specific relative rates to estimate an overall effect by taking into account the variability within and across cities. We perform the calculations with respect to several random effects distributions (normal, t-student, and mixture of normal), thus relaxing the common assumption of a two-stage normal-normal hierarchical model. We assess the sensitivity of the results to: (i) lag structure for ozone exposure; (ii) degree of adjustment for long-term trends; (iii) inclusion of other pollutants in the model; (iv) heat waves; (v) random effects distributions; and (vi) prior hyperparameters.On average across cities, we found that a 10ppb increase in summer ozone level over the previous week is associated with a 1.25 per cent increase in CVDRESP mortality (95 per cent posterior regions: 0.47, 2.03). The relative rate estimates are also positive and statistically significant at lags 0, 1 and 2. We found that associations between summer ozone and CVDRESP mortality are sensitive to the confounding adjustment for PM10, but are robust to: (i) the adjustment for long-term trends, other gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 and CO); (ii) the distributional assumptions at the second stage of the hierarchical model; and (iii) the prior distributions on all unknown parameters.Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models and their application to the NMMAPS data allow us to estimate of an acute health effect associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in the last few days on average across several locations.

Many estimates of human lung cancer risk from inhaled DE have been developed from rat bioassay data or from the comparative mutagenic potencies of DE soot extract and known human chemical carcinogens. To explore the importance of the DE soot-associated organic compounds in the lung tumor response of rats, male and female F344 rats were exposed chronically to diluted whole DE or aerosolized carbon black(CB) 16 hr/day, 5 days/week at target particle concentrations of 2.5 mg/m(3) (LDE, LCB) or 6.5 mg/m(3) (HDE, HCB) or to filtered air. The CB served as a surrogate for the elemental carbon matrix of DE soot. Considering both the mass fraction of solvent-extractable matter and its mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella assay, the mutagenicity in revertants per unit particle mass of the CB was three orders of magnitude less than that of the DE soot. Both DE soot and CB particles accumulated progressively in the lungs of exposed rats, but the rate of accumulation was higher for DE soot. In general, DE and CB caused similar, dose-related, nonneoplastic lesions. CB and DE caused significant, exposure concentration-related increases, of similar magnitudes, in the incidences and prevalences of the same types of malignant and benign lung neoplasms in female rats. The incidences of neoplasms were much lower in males than females, and the incidences were slightly higher among DE- than CB-exposed males. Survival was shortened in the CB-exposed males, and the shortened survival may have suppressed the expression of carcinogenicity as measured by crude incidence. Logistic regression modeling did not demonstrate significant differences between the carcinogenic potencies of CB and DE in either gender. The re suits suggest that the organic fraction of DE may not play an important role in the carcinogenicity of DE in rats.

All hematologic parameters (total white blood cells [WBC], absolute lymphocyte count, platelets, red blood cells, and hematocrit) were decreased among exposed workers compared to controls, with the exception of the red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which was higher among exposed subjects. In a subgroup of workers who were not exposed to more than 31 ppm benzene on any of 5 sampling days (n = 11, median 8 hr TWA = 7.6 ppm, range = 1-20 ppm), only the absolute lymphocyte count was significantly different between exposed workers (mean [sd] 1.6 [0.4] x 10(3) mu L) and controls (1.9 [0.4] x 10(3) mu L, p = 0.03). Among exposed subjects, a dose-response relationship with various measures of current benzene exposure (i.e., personal air monitoring, benzene metabolites in urine) was present only for the total WBC count, the absolute lymphocyte count, and the MCV. Correlations between benzene metabolites and hematologic parameters were generally similar, although hydroquinone was somewhat more strongly associated with a decrease in the absolute lymphocyte count, and catechol was more strongly associated with an increase in MCV.

In the National Cancer Institute's formaldehyde cohort, previously followed through December 31, 1979, and updated through December 31, 1994, formaldehyde exposure was associated with an increased risk for leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, that increased with peak and average intensity of exposure. We extended follow-up through December 31, 2004 (median follow-up = 42 years), for 25 619 workers employed at one of 10 formaldehyde-using or formaldehyde-producing plants before 1966. We used Poisson regression to calculate relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine associations between quantitative formaldehyde exposure estimates (peak exposure, average intensity and cumulative exposure) and death from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered to be significant at P = .05. When follow-up ended in 2004, there were statistically significant increased risks for the highest vs lowest peak formaldehyde exposure category (>= 4 parts per million [ppm] vs > 0 to < 2.0 ppm) and all lymphohematopoietic malignancies (RR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.81, P trend = .02) and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 3.96; 95% CI = 1.31 to 12.02, P trend = .01).

There was little evidence of association for any lymphohematopoietic malignancy with average intensity or cumulative exposure at the end of follow-up in 2004. However, disease associations varied over time. For peak exposure, the highest formaldehyde-related risks for myeloid leukemia occurred before 1980, but trend tests attained statistical significance in 1990 only. After the mid-1990s, the formaldehyde-related risk of myeloid leukemia declined. Evaluation of risks over time suggests a possible link between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia but also perhaps Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Observed patterns could be due to chance but are also consistent with a causal association within the relatively short induction-incubation periods characteristic of leukemogenesis. Further epidemiological study and exploration of potential molecular mechanisms are warranted. ",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,Coal Miners exposed to diesel exhaust emissions,ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE,0003-4878,"REGER, R; HANCOCK, J; HANKINSON, J; et al",10.1093/annhyg/26.8.799 ,1982,National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,,,Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,Mortality from lymphohematopoietic malignancies among workers in formaldehyde industries,JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,0027-8874,"Hauptmann, M; Lubin, JH; Stewart, PA; et al.",10.1093/jnci/djg083,3-Nov,"National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services","National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services","Background: Many U.S. factory workers are exposed to formaldehyde. Although increased risks for leukemia have been found in medical workers and other professionals exposed to formaldehyde, studies in industrial workers, who are thought to have higher exposures, have shown inconsistent associations. We extended follow-up of a cohort of industrial workers to evaluate the association between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic cancers. Methods: The cohort consisted of 25 619 workers (865 708 person-years) employed before January 1, 1966, at one of 10 U.S. industrial plants and followed through December 31, 1994. We analyzed formaldehyde exposure (peak exposure, average exposure intensity, cumulative exposure, and duration of exposure) and mortality from lymphohematopoietic malignancies using standardized mortality ratios and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Poisson regression. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among the cohort, there were 178 deaths from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. Relative risks for leukemia (69 deaths), particularly for myeloid leukemia (30 deaths), increased with formaldehyde exposure. Compared with workers exposed to low peak levels of formaldehyde (0.1-1.9 ppm), relative risks for myeloid leukemia were 2.43 (95% CI = 0.81 to 7.25) and 3.46 (95% CI = 1.27 to 9.43) for workers exposed to peak levels of 2.0-3.9 ppm and greater than or equal to4.0 ppm, respectively (P-trend =.009). Compared with workers exposed to low levels of average exposure intensity of formaldehyde (0.1-0.4 ppm), workers exposed to 0.5-0.9 ppm and greater than or equal to1.0 ppm average intensity had relative risks of 1.15 (95% CI = 0.41 to 3.23) and 2.49 (95% CI = 1.03 to 6.03), respectively (P-trend =.088). The relative risk for leukemia was not associated with cumulative exposure but was weakly associated with duration of exposure. Relative risks for Hodgkin's disease also increased with formaldehyde exposure. Conclusions: Exposure to formaldehyde may cause leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, in humans.

Such projections, made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), are not based on behavioral analysis of Gulf countries' decisions, but are merely the residual demand for OPEC oil - the difference between projected world oil demand and Non-OPEC supply, given some assumed price path. I employ a simulation model to compare OPEC's payoffs from faster or slower output growth, under various parametric assumptions about the responsiveness of world oil demand and Non-OPEC supply to income and price changes. The payoffs to OPEC are relatively insensitive to faster output growth; aggressive output expansion yields slightly lower payoffs than just maintaining current market share. Analysis of intro-OPEC decisions - between. the Core countries and the others - suggests a similar conclusion: these two groups are engaged in a constant-sum game.

In addition, daily hospital admissions for respiratory causes, other community air pollutant measurements (e.g., ozone, O3), and meteorological data (e.g., temperature) were also obtained for these metropolitan areas. The summer months (June-August) were selected for analysis because that is when the highest H+ (and O3) are usually experienced at these sites, and because these months are rarely complicated by other major influences (e.g., high pollen counts). Thus, any pollution-admissions relationships were expected to be most clearly discernible in this season. Prior to the health effects analysis, the summer admissions and environmental data were first detrended to eliminate long-wave autocorrelations, and day-of-week effects were removed via regression. Cross-correlations of the filtered 1988 and 1989 admissions and environmental data revealed strong associations between elevated summer haze pollution (i.e., H+, SO4=, and O3) and increased total respiratory and asthma admissions on the same day and/or on subsequent days in Buffalo and New York City, especially during the summer of 1988 (when pollution levels were more extreme). Regression analyses indicated that the pollution-admissions associations remained significant (p<0.05) even after the simultaneous inclusion of lagged daily maximum temperature. Mean effects calculations for these cities indicated that summertime haze can play a significant role in the occurrence of respiratory admissions in that season: accounting for an average 6 to 24% of 1988 Buffalo and NYC asthma admissions (depending on the pollutant index employed). O3 consistently had the highest mean effects estimates. Relative risk (RR) calculations indicated that the risk of admission for asthma was increased by a factor of 1.19 to 1.43 in these cities on maximum 1988 summertime pollution days, with H+ consistently having the highest RR estimates. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ambient acid aerosol peaks (eg., H+ greater-than-or-equal-to 100 nmol/m3) can potentiate the respiratory disease effects of O3. Associations were weaker in the less urbanized Albany metropolitan area and in the New York City (NYC) suburbs, even though the NYC suburban O3 exposures were similar to (and the H+ concentrations may even be somewhat higher than) those in the center city. Examination of census data regarding the prevalence of poverty in these various areas suggested that localities having the highest percentages of the underprivileged in their urban cores are those in which the adverse effects of air pollution are most likely to result in hospital admissions for respiratory causes. This may reflect racial differences in pollution response, inadequate health care (e.g., due lo lack of insurance), poor nutrition, or some, as yet unidentified, factor associated with high population density. The reason(s) for the apparently higher urban core associations between air pollution and respiratory hospital admissions will be investigated further in future analyses of these data.

Daily counts of respiratory admissions to 22 acute care hospitals and daily meteorological and environmental data (e.g. ozone [O-3], total suspended particulate matter [TSP], and thoracic particle mass [PM10] were also obtained. Regression analyses indicated that only the O-3, H+, and SO4= associations with respiratory and asthma admissions remained consistently significant after controlling for temperature. Even after excluding days with maximum 1-hr O-3 > 120 ppb, O-3 was still strongly significant. In the various model specifications considered, the relative particle metric strengths of association with admissions were generally H+ > SO4= > FP > PM10 > TSP, indicating that particle size and composition are of central importance in defining the adverse human health effects of particulate matter. On average, summertime haze air pollution was associated with 24% of all respiratory admissions (21% with O-3, 3% with H+). On peak pollution days, however, aerosol acidity yielded the highest relative risk estimates (e.g., RR = 1.5 at 391 nmole/m(3) H+), and summertime haze was associated with roughly half of all respiratory admissions.

The peripheral blood cells were counted by a cell counter The WBC differential was manually counted on a total of 900 cells by a US commercial laboratory. Results A total of 130 exposed workers and 51 age- and gender-matched unexposed subjects were recruited in this study. Benzene exposure levels monitored on the day of biological sample collection for exposed workers ranged from 0.06 to 122 ppm.

Estimates of sulfate deposition for forested areas had decreasing trends (1994-2000) across RPA regions that were statistically significant for North and South RPA regions. Nitrate deposition rates were relatively constant for the 1994 to 2000 period, but the South RPA region had a statistically decreasing trend. The North and South RPA regions experienced the highest ammonium deposition rates and showed slightly decreasing trends. Ozone concentrations were highest in portions of the Pacific Coast RPA region and relatively high across much of the South RPA region. Both the South and Rocky Mountain RPA regions had an increasing trend in ozone exposure. Ozone-induced foliar injury to sensitive species was recorded in all regions except for the Rocky Mountain region. The multivariate analysis showed that the oak-hickory and loblolly-shortleaf pine forest types were generally exposed to more air pollution than other forest types, and the redwood, western white pine, and larch forest types were generally exposed to less. These findings offer a new approach to national air pollution assessments and are intended to help focus research and planning initiatives related to air pollution and forest health.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,Mechanistic analysis of plant responses to air pollution.,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,1051-0761,"Winner, W.E.",10.2307/1941998,1994,Oregon State University,,"Human activity is altering the chemistry of the atmosphere, which, in turn, is affecting the physiology and growth of plants. The purpose of this article is to develop four ideas that are currently emerging from the work of a diverse group of plant scientists. (1) Air pollution definitions: The definition of air pollution has been broadened, and research activities are expanding to include analysis of plant responses to a wide range of atmospheric chemicals emitted from anthropogenic sources but not previously considered as air pollutants. Thus experiments with CO2 and other trace gases are being pursued with approaches developed in air pollution research. (2) Air pollution uptake: Efforts are increasing to better quantify air pollution absorption rates through stomata in order to calculate actual dose vs, plant responses. The flux rates of gaseous pollutants into leaves, especially O-3, are largely dependent upon stomatal conductance. Approaches are being developed to calculate stomatal absorption of gaseous pollutants, based on stomatal conductance values for water vapor and ambient air-pollution concentrations. Calculation of air pollution absorption rates will allow responses of plants to pollutants to be assessed in toxicological frameworks and will help characterize the strength of vegetation as sinks for some gaseous pollutants. (3) Compensatory responses: Plant responses to air pollutants can be interpreted as compensatory, i.e., a physiological adjustment to an environmental stress that maximizes productivity above that which would have occurred in the absence of compensation. Examples of compensatory responses to air pollutants are shifts in root-to-shoot ratio and accelerated rates of leaf maturation. Recognition of compensatory responses to air pollutants allows these responses to be placed in a framework that relates to whole-plant processes and ecosystem functions. (4) Air pollution and multiple stresses: Air pollution stress seldom occurs in isolation, and research approaches are being developed around the concept of multiple interacting stresses. Multiple-stress experiments are important because factors such as plant water status, light, and nutrient availability are known to alter plant responses to air pollutants. Multiple-stress studies will involve experiments with model plant species and high degrees of environmental control and monitoring.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,The benefits of pollution control: the case of ozone and United States agriculture,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,0002-9092 ,"ADAMS, RM; HAMILTON, SA; MCCARL, BA",10.2307/1242135,Nov-86,Oregon State University; Northwest Economic Associates; Texas A&M University,US Environmental Protection Agency,,Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,12,Development of an empirical model to estimate real-world fine particulate matter emission factors: the Traffic Air Quality model.,JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION,1096-2247,"Soliman, A.S.M.; Jacko, J.B.; Palmer, G.M.",,6-Nov,Purdue University,Federal Highway Administration; Indiana Department of Transportation,"The purpose of the study was to quantify the impact of traffic conditions, such as free flow and congestion, on local air quality. The Borman Expressway (1-80/94) in Northwest Indiana is considered a test bed for this research because of the high volume of class 9 truck traffic traveling on it, as well as the existing and continuing installation of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to improve traffic management along the highway stretch. An empirical traffic air quality (TAQ) model was developed to estimate the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emission factors (grams per kilometer) based solely on the measured traffic parameters, namely, average speed, average acceleration, and class 9 truck density. The TAQ model has shown better predictions that matched the measured emission factor values more than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-PARTS model. During congestion (defined as flow-speeds < 50 km/hr [30 mi/hr]), the TAQ model, on average, overpredicted the measured values only by a factor of 1.2, in comparison to a fourfold underprediction using the EPA-PARTS model. On the other hand, during free flow (defined as flow, speeds > 80 km/hr [50 mi/hr]), the TAQ model was conservative in that it overpredicted the measured values by 1.5-fold.",Scholarly Journal,,2060-AP61,,1,"Assessing Energy, Environmental, and Economic Tradeoffs in Intermodal Freight Transportation",Journal of Air & Waste Management Association,1096-2247,"Winebrake, James J; Corbett, James J; Falzarano, Aaron; Hawker, J.

A modified factor analysis-multiple regression model was successfully applied to the source apportionment of atmospheric PAHs (gas + particle). Coal combustion accounted for 48 +/- 5% of the Sigma PAH concentration in both the urban and adjacent coastal atmosphere, natural gas combustion accounted for 26 +/- 2%, coke ovens accounted for 14 + 3%, and vehicle emissions (gas + diesel) accounted for 9 +/- 4%.

More than 95% of atmospheric PAHs were in the vapor phase and about 73% of PAHs in the rain were in the dissolved phase. Phenanthrene and napthalene were the dominant compounds in air vapor and rain dissolved phases, respectively, while 5 and 6 ring PAH were predominant in the particulate phase of both air and rain samples. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 4 to 161 ng m(-3) in air samples and from 50 to 312 ng l(-1) in rain samples. Temporal variability in total PAH air concentrations were observed. with lower concentrations in the spring and fall (4-34 ng m (-3)) compared to the summer and winter (37-161 ng m(-3)). PAHs in the air near Galveston Bay are derived from both combustion and petroleum vaporization.

The mean time weighted average formaldehyde exposure at the plants in the early 1980s was 0.15 ppm but past exposures may have been substantially higher. Methods: Vital status was updated through 1998, and life table analyses were conducted. Results: Mortality from all causes (2206 deaths, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.96) and all cancers (SMR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) was less than expected based on US mortality rates. A non-significant increase in mortality from myeloid leukaemia (15 deaths, SMR 1.44, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.37) was observed. Mortality from myeloid leukaemia was greatest among workers first exposed in the earliest years when exposures were presumably higher, among workers with 10 or more years of exposure, and among workers with 20 or more years since first exposure. No nasal or nasopharyngeal cancers were observed. Mortality from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer (147 deaths, SMR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15) was not increased. Multiple cause mortality from leukaemia was increased almost twofold among workers with both 10 or more years of exposure and 20 years or more since first exposure (15 deaths, SMR 1.92, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.17). Multiple cause mortality from myeloid leukaemia among this group of workers was also significantly increased (8 deaths, SMR 2.55, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.03). Conclusions: Results support a possible relation between formaldehyde exposure and myeloid leukaemia mortality. Previous epidemiological studies supporting a relation between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia mortality have been primarily of formaldehyde exposed professional groups, not formaldehyde exposed industrial workers. Limitations include limited power to detect an excess for rare cancers such as nasal and nasopharyngeal cancers and lack of individual exposure estimates. ",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Hematotoxicity and carcinogenicity of benzene.,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,0091-6765,"Aksoy, M",10.2307/3430775,Jul-89,"The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey, Research Institute for Basic Sciences, Department of Biology, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey",,,Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Benzene Toxicity,OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-STATE OF THE ART REVIEWS,0885-114X,"Goldstein, B.D.",,Jul-88,UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School,,,Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Effects of urban heavy metal pollution on organic matter decomposition in Quercus ilix L. woods,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,0269-7491,"COTRUFO, MF; DESANTO, AV; ALFANI, A; et al.",10.1016/0269-7491(94)00041-B,1995,"Università Federico II', via Foria, Napoli, Italia",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,"Decomposition of oak (Quercus ilex) leaves containing different concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni and Pb was measured in laboratory microcosms.

The soils from the two sites differed significantly in heavy metals concentrations. The accumulated mass loss reached an asymptotic value after four months both for the control and polluted litters. However, control and polluted litters significantly differed in accumulated mass loss, that was respectively 40 % and 29 % of the initial weight, after 10 months. Moreover decomposition rates appeared to be strongly influenced by metal contamination in the early stages, while in later stages, they did not differ significantly. Litter respiration appeared to be inhibited by metal contamination and showed pattern and rates consistent with those found for litter decomposition. Fungal mycelia were significantly less abundant both in litter and soil from the polluted site than from the control site.

To address these points, the following subgroups of children were selected from a survey population of all 2,200 elementary school children (6 to 13 yr of age) in a pulp mill community on the west coast of Vancouver Island: (1) all children with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 75 participated), (2) all children with an exercise-induced fall in FEV1 without diagnosed asthma (n = 57), (3) all children with airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.76) without either of the above (n = 18), and (4) control children without any of the above (n = 56). The children were followed for as long as 18 mo with twice daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and daily symptom diary recording. Maximum daily PM10 concentration was 159 mu m/m(3) (median, 22.1), but only 8 d (1.2%) had concentrations above 100 mu g/m(3). In an analysis that accounted for time-varying covariates, and serially correlated and missing data, for the entire sample of children, increases in PM10 were associated with reductions in PEF and increased reporting of cough, phlegm production, and sore throat. For the subgroup of children with diagnosed asthma, PEF in the time period with the highest PM10 concentrations fell by an estimated 0.55 L/min (95% CI, 0.06 to 1.05) for a 10 mu g/m(3) PM10 increase above the mean daily PM10 concentration of 27.3 mu g/m(3) and the odds of reported cough increased by 8% (95% CI, 0 to 16%); no consistent effects were observed in the other groups of children.

Zhu et al. (J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc., 2002, accepted for publication) conducted systematic measurements of the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of a highway dominated by gasoline vehicle. The present study compares these previous measurements with those made on Interstate 710 freeway in Los Angeles. The 710 freeway was selected because more than 25% of the vehicles are heavy-duty diesel trucks. Particle number concentration and size distribution in the size range from 6 to 220 nm were measured by a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. Measurements were taken at 17, 20, 30, 90, 150, and 300 m downwind and 200 m upwind from the center of the freeway. At each sampling location, concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) were also measured by a Dasibi CO monitor and an Aethalometer, respectively. The range of average concentration of CO, BC and total particle number concentration at 17 m was 1.9-2.6 ppm, 20.3-24.8 mug/m(3), 1.8 x 10(5)-3.5 x 10(5)/cm(3), respectively. Relative concentration of CO, BC and particle number decreased exponentially and tracked each other well as one moves away from the freeway. Both atmospheric dispersion and coagulation appears to contribute to the rapid decrease in particle number concentration and change in particle size distribution with increasing distance from the freeway. Average traffic flow during the sampling periods was 12,180 vehicles/h with more than 25% of vehicles being heavy-duty diesel trucks. Ultrafine particle number concentration measured at 300 m downwind from the freeway was indistinguishable from upwind background concentration.

Approximately 57000 of the available slots in California child care centers (7% of the overall capacity) are in facilities located within 200 m (650 ft) of roadways averaging 50000 or more vehicles per day, and another 172000 (21%) are in facilities located within 200 m of roadways averaging 25000 to 49000 vehicles per day. Facilities providing care to infants or preschool-aged children and facilities located in disadvantaged areas were more often situated in medium- or high-traffic areas. Additional research is needed to further clarify the significance of the child care microenvironment in terms of potential childhood exposures to vehicle-related pollutants.

Optimal enhancement was obtained with 1-mu-M HQ and was largely independent of the concentration of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment with other authentic benzene metabolites, phenol and catechol, and the putative metabolite trans,trans-muconaldehyde did not enhance growth factor response. Coadministration of phenol and HQ did not enhance the maximal rGM-CSF response obtained with HQ alone but shifted the optimal concentration to 100 pM. Synergism between HQ and rGM-CSF was observed with nonadherent bone marrow cells and lineage-depleted bone marrow cells, suggesting an intrinsic effect on recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells not normally responsive to rGM-CSF. Alterations in differentiation in a myeloid progenitor cell population may be of relevance in the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia secondary to drug or chemical exposure.",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Diesel asthma: reactive airways disease following overexposure to locomotive exhaust ,Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine,1076-2752,"WADE, JF; NEWMAN, LS",10.1097/00043764-199302000-00015,Feb-93,University of Colorado School of Medicine,Physician Scientist Award; Specialized Center of Research,"While some of the gaseous and particulate components of diesel exhaust can cause pulmonary irritation and bronchial hyperreactivity, diesel exhaust exposure has not been shown to cause asthma.

Acrolein (1.1 ppm) and acetic acid (330 ppm) vapors induced an immediate increase in flow resistance, as measured in the surgically isolated URT of urethane-anesthetized healthy animals. Acrolein, but not acetic acid, induced a small URT vasodilatory response. In awake spontaneously breathing mice, both vapors induced a prolonged pause at the start of expiration (a response mediated via stimulation of nasal trigeminal nerves) and an increase in total respiratory specific airway flow resistance, the magnitude of which was similar to that observed in the isolated URT. Both responses were significantly reduced in animals pretreated with large doses of capsaicin to defunctionalize sensory nerves, strongly suggesting a role for sensory nerves in development of these responses. The breathing pattern and/or obstructive responses were enhanced in mice with ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease.

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a ""one-atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation. This paper describes the Models-3 CMAQ system, its governing equations, important science algorithms, and a few application examples.

Karst) seedlings were exposed to traffic emissions along roadsides with three different traffic densities and speed limits; highway, street and a quiet local road. Deposition of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was determined at all sites using moss bags as an indicator of organic traffic pollutant deposition. Short term concentrations of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx) and aerosol black carbon (BC) were also recorded from the sites. The responses of the needle epicuticular wax structure of the exposed spruce seedlings were analysed under the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The epistomatal wax structure of needles was distinctively fused and aggregated along the highway and street with relatively high traffic densities. Along the local road, where the traffic density was low, no significant degradation of needle epicuticular wax was observed. The NOx and BC data, along with PAHs accumulated in moss bags indicate significant deposition of gaseous pollutants and particulate organic compounds along the highway and street and these are suggested as cause of the epicuticular wax degradation.

The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have biological significance.

The model utilized mercury monitoring data collected during the Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study and the Atmospheric Exchange Over Lakes and Oceans Study together with high-resolution over-water meteorological data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (July, 1994-October, 1995). Atmospheric deposition was determined to be the primary pathway for mercury input to Lake Michigan, contributing approximately 84% of the estimated 1403 kg total annual input (atmospheric deposition + tributary input). Wet (10.6 mug m(-2)) and dry deposition (9.7 mug m(-2)) contributed almost equally to the annual atmospheric Hg deposition of 20.3 mug m(-2) (1173 kg). Re-emission of dissolved gaseous Hg from the lake was also significant (7.8 mug m(-2)), reducing the net atmospheric deposition to 12.5 mug m(-2) (720 kg). A strong urban influence was observed in the over-water mercury deposition estimates in the southern portion of the lake.

This study examines the proximity of grade K-12 schools to high traffic roads in Wayne County, Michigan, an area including the industrialized city of Detroit as well as outlying urban and suburban communities. Unlike earlier studies, commercial and non-commercial traffic is distinguished, and effects of school type (public, charter, private), socio-economic variables, demographic factors, and mapping errors are evaluated. We find that total traffic flow, as measured by annual average daily traffic (AADT), does not reflect the substantial differences between trucking and commuting routes. Thus, AADT alone may inadequately capture traffic-related exposures, especially given the large differences between diesel and gasoline emissions. Based on close proximity (school-road distance <= 150 m) to heavy traffic (AADT >= 50,000), 4.9% of the 845 Wayne County schools are traffic exposed at school. In the urban core area, 7.2% of schools and 7.6% of students are traffic exposed at school. A larger proportion of grade 7-12 students in public schools are exposed than K-6 students. Considering truck emissions, 2.8% of the schools are within 150 m of roads with 5000 or more trucks per day. In Wayne County, students attending schools near high traffic roads are more likely to be Black or Hispanic, to be enrolled in a meal program, and to reside in a poor area. Many of these results are driven by the large minority population in the densely populated core area of Detroit.

These occupational groups are exposed to mixtures of diesel and gasoline exhaust on a regular basis in various ratios. The three groups had significantly different exposures to workshift TWA EC with the highest levels observed in the bus garage mechanics and the lowest levels in the parking ramp booth attendants. In terms of surface area, parking ramp attendants had significantly greater exposures than bus garage mechanics, who in turn had significantly greater exposures than bus drivers. In terms of number concentrations, the exposures of garage mechanics exceeded those of ramp booth attendants by a factor of 5-6. Depending on the exposure metric chosen, the three occupational groups had quite different exposure rankings. This illustrates the importance of the choice of exposure metric in epidemiological studies. If these three occupational groups were part of an epidemiological study, depending on the metric used, they may or may not be part of the same similarly exposed group (SEG).

The accumulation of PAHs in the sediments increased dramatically around 1900, reached a plateau around 1930-1975, and decreased slightly in recent time. Surface sediment accumulation rates and inventories for Sigma PAHs (n = 17 parent), corrected for sediment focusing with Pb-210, equaled 50-70 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) and 5000-7000 ng cm(-2), respectively. The relative abundances of individual PAH compounds from Lake Michigan sediments, PM-10 aerosol of Chicago, and a coke oven signature are statistically similar establishing a linkage between combustion sources in the south, atmospheric deposition, and sediment accumulation. Further support for this linkage is the historical PAH accumulation in lake sediments and historical coal use in Illinois over the same time period. The major source of PAHs to Lake Michigan sediments is coke and steel production found in the urban/industrial complex around Chicago, IL, and Gary, IN. These PAHs are deposited primarily in the southern basin after which they are redistributed throughout the lake as a result of in-lake integration processes (water and sediment transport).",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,1,Elementary school absenteeism and air pollution,Inhalation Toxicology,0895-8378,"Chen, L; Jennison, BL; Yang, W; Omaye, ST",,Nov-00,University of Nevada; Washoe County District Health Department; Nevada State Health Division,US Environmental Protection Agency,"This study assessed the association between ambient air pollution and daily elementary school absenteeism in Washoe County, NV, between 1996 and 1998.

In this study, we combined leaf-level ozone response data from independent ozone fumigation studies with a forest ecosystem model in order simulate the effects of ambient ozone on mature hardwood forests. Reductions in leaf carbon gain were determined as a linear function of ozone flux to the leaf interior, calculated as the product of ozone concentration and leaf stomatal conductance. This relationship was applied to individual canopy layers within the model in order to allow interaction with stand-and canopy-level factors such as light attenuation, leaf morphology, soil water limitations, and vertical ozone gradients.  The resulting model was applied to 64 locations across the northeastern United States using ambient ozone data from 1987 to 1992. Predicted declines in annual net primary production ranged from 3 to 16% with greatest reductions in southern portions of the region where ozone levels were highest, and on soils with high water-holding capacity where drought stress was absent. Reductions in predicted wood growth were slightly greater (3-22%) because wood is a lower carbon allocation priority in the model than leaf and root growth. Interannual variation in predicted ozone effects was small due to concurrent fluctuations in ozone and climate, Periods of high ozone often coincided with hot, dry weather conditions, causing reduced stomatal conductance and ozone uptake. Within-canopy ozone concentration gradients had little effect on predicted growth reductions because concentrations remained high through upper canopy layers where net carbon assimilation and ozone uptake were greatest. Sensitivity analyses indicate a trade-off between model sensitivity to available soil water and foliar nitrogen and demonstrate uncertainties regarding several assumptions used in the model. Uncertainties surrounding ozone effects on stomatal function and plant water use efficiency were found to have important implications on current predictions, Field measurements of ozone effects on mature forests will be needed before the accuracy of model predictions can be fully assessed.",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Effects of steady-state and variable ozone concentration profiles on pulmonary function,American Review of respiratory Disease,1073-449X,"Hazucha, M.

Several recent studies have suggested that in estimating exposure dose (O3 concentration [C] x exposure time [T] x ventilation [V]), O3 concentration needs to be weighted more heavily than either ventilation or duration of exposure in the estimates. In this study we tested the hypothesis that regardless of concentration pattern and exposure rate the same exposure dose of O3 will induce the same spirometric response. We exposed 23 healthy male volunteers (20 to 35 yr of age) for 8 h to air, 0.12 ppm O3 (steady-state), and a triangular exposure pattern (concentration increased steadily from zero to 0.24 ppm over the first 4 h and decreased back to zero by 8 h). During the first 30 min of each hour, subjects exercised for 30 min at minute ventilation (VE) approximately 40 L/min. The order of the exposures was randomized, and the exposures were separated by at least 7 days. The response patterns over the 8-h periods for spirometric variables in both O3 exposures were statistically different from air exposure changes and from each other. For FEV1 the p values were 0.017 between air and steady-state profile, 0.002 between air and triangular profile, and 0.037 between steady-state and triangular profiles. Although in the triangular pattern of exposure the maximal O3 concentration was reached at 4 h, the maximum FEV1 decrement (10.2%) was observed at 6 h of exposure. Our observations demonstrate that the product of CBAR (mean) x T x V is not a sufficient index of exposure. At low O3 concentrations the key determinant of spirometric changes appears to be averaged exposure rate (ppm x L x h-1).",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Implications of Platinum-Group Element Accumulation along U.S. Roads from Catalytic-Converter Attrition,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,0013-936X,"Ely, JC; Neal, CR; Kulpa, CF; et al.",10.1021/es001989s,1-Oct,University of Notre Dame; Wichita State University,University of Notre Dame; National Science Foundation,"Automobile catalytic converters are dispersing platinum-group elements (PGEs) Rh, Pt, and Pd into the environment (1-3).

Some epidemiologic studies have linked occupational exposure to formaldehyde with cancers of the nose, nasopharynx, and lung, but the evidence for human carcinogenicity has been inconsistent and requires clarification. Methods: We extended by 11 years the follow-up of an existing cohort of 14 014 men employed after 1937 at six British factories where formaldehyde was produced or used. Subjects had been identified from employment records, and their jobs had been classified for potential exposure to formaldehyde. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were derived using the person-years method and were compared with the expected numbers of deaths for the national population. Results: During follow-up through December 31, 2000, 5185 deaths were recorded, including two from sino-nasal cancer (2.3 expected) and one from nasopharyngeal cancer (2.0 expected). Relative to the national population, mortality from lung cancer was increased among those who worked with formaldehyde, particularly in men in the highest of four estimated exposure categories (>2 ppm) (SMR = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.40 to 1.78), and the increase persisted after adjustment for local geographic variations in mortality (SMR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.13 to 1.44). However, there was a statistically nonsignificant decrease in the risk of death from lung cancer with duration of high exposure (P-trend =.18), and this risk showed no trend with time since first high exposure (P-trend =.99).

The contribution of traffic to individual exposures is difficult to quantify in traditional epidemiological studies, however, and researchers have employed various approaches in attempt to isolate its effects. Many investigators have employed ambient measurements such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, or black carbon as surrogates for traffic in studying associations with health outcomes. Source-apportionment techniques also have been used in a few studies to identify associations with the mixture of pollutants from specific origins, including traffic. In other studies, estimates of traffic near a person's home have predicted cardiovascular endpoints, and local traffic levels have modified the effect of regional air pollution. More recently, studies have linked changes in cardiovascular health to time spent in traffic. In this article, we review the epidemiological evidence regarding the impact of traffic-related pollution on cardiovascular diseases and examine the different techniques used to examine this important research question.

We previously conducted a study showing a relationship between asthma visits in all persons < 65 years of age to emergency departments (EDs) and air pollution in Seattle, Washington. In that study the most frequent zip codes of the visits were in the inner city. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health (Seattle, WA) subsequently published a report which showed that the hospitalization rate for children in the inner city was over 600/100,000, whereas it was < 100/100,000 for children living in the suburbs. Therefore, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether asthma visits to hospital emergency departments in the inner city of Seattle were associated,vith outdoor air pollution levels. ED visits to six hospitals for asthma and daily air pollution data were obtained for 15 months during 1995 and 1996. The association between air pollution and childhood ED visits for asthma from the inner city area with high asthma hospitalization rates were compared with those from lower hospital utilization areas. Daily ED counts were regressed against fine particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide using a semiparametric Poisson regression model. Significant associations were found between ED visits for asthma in children and fine PM and CO. A change of 11 mu g/m(3) in fine PM was associated with a relative rate of 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.23]. There was no stronger association between ED visits for asthma and air pollution in the higher hospital utilization area than in the lower utilization area. These findings were seen when estimated PM2.5 concentrations were below the newly adopted annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 15 mu g/m(3).",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,1,A National Estimate of the Economic Costs of Asthma,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Smith, DH; Malone, DC; Lawson, KA; Okamoto, LJ; Battista, C; Saunders, WB",,Sep-97,"University of Washington, Seattle; University of Colorado; University of Texas at Austin; Glaxo Wellcome Inc.",Glaxo Wellcome Inc.,"This cost of illness analysis examines national cost and resource utilization by persons with asthma using a single, comprehensive data source, the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey.

Our study involved analysis of cohorts consisting of approximately 4 million infants born between 1989 and 1991 in states that report relevant covariates; this included 86 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics-linked birth/infant death records were combined at the MSA level with measurements of particulate matter 10 mu m or less (PM10) from the EPA's Aerometric Database, Infants were categorized as having high, medium, or low exposures based on tertiles of PM10, Total and cause-specific postneonatal mortality rates were examined using logistic :regression to control for demographic and environmental factors. Overall postneonatal mortality rates were 3.1 among infants with low PM10, exposures, 3.5 among infants with medium PM10 exposures, and 3.7 among highly exposed infants. After adjustment for other covariates, the odds ratio (QR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total postneonatal mortality for the high exposure versus the low exposure group was 1.10 (1.04, 1.16). In normal birth weight infants, high PM10 exposure was associated with respiratory causes [OR = 1.40, (1.05, 1.85)] and sudden infant death syndrome [OR = 1.26, (1.14, 1.39)]. For low birth weight babies, high PM10 exposure was associated, but not significantly, with mortality from respiratory causes [OR = 1.18, (0.86, 1.61)]. This study suggests that particulate matter is associated with risk of postneonatal mortality.

An inference of their modeling approach was that formaldehyde-induced tumorigenicity could be optimally explained without the role of formaldehyde's mutagenic action. In this article, we examine the strength of this result and modify select features to examine the sensitivity of the predicted dose response to select assumptions. We implement solutions to the two-stage cancer model that are valid for nonhomogeneous models (i.e., models with time-dependent parameters), thus accounting for time dependence in variables. In this reimplementation, we examine the sensitivity of model predictions to pooling historical and concurrent control data, and to lumping sacrificed animals in which tumors were discovered incidentally with those in which death was caused by the tumors. We found the CIIT model results were not significantly altered with the nonhomogeneous solutions. Dose-response predictions below the range of exposures where tumors occurred in the bioassays were highly sensitive to the choice of control data. In the range of exposures where tumors were observed, the model attributed up to 74% of the added tumor probability to formaldehyde's mutagenic action when our reanalysis restricted the use of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) historical control data to only those obtained from inhalation exposures. Model results were insensitive to hourly or daily temporal variations in DNA protein cross-link (DPX) concentration, a surrogate for the dose-metric linked to formaldehyde-induced mutations, prompting us to utilize weekly averages for this quantity. Various other biological and mathematical uncertainties in the model have been retained unmodified in this analysis. These include model specification of initiated cell division and death rates, and uncertainty and variability in the dose response for cell replication rates, issues that will be considered in a future paper.",Scholarly Journal2060-AP61,,12,Uncertainties in biologically-based modeling of formaldehyde-induced cancer risk: identification of key issues,RISK ANALYSIS,0272-4332,"Subramaniam, Ravi P.; Chen, Chao; Crump, Kenny S.; et al.",10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01083.x,8-Aug,US Environmental Protection Agency; Louisiana Tech University; National Institutes of Health,Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"In a series of articles and a health-risk assessment report, scientists at the CIIT Hamner Institutes developed a model (CIIT model) for estimating respiratory cancer risk due to inhaled formaldehyde within a conceptual framework incorporating extensive mechanistic information and advanced computational methods at the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic levels.

In this article, we study the CIIT model to identify key biological and statistical uncertainties that need careful evaluation if such two-stage clonal expansion models are to be used for extrapolation of cancer risk from animal bioassays to human exposure. Broadly, these issues pertain to the use and interpretation of experimental labeling index and tumor data, the evaluation and biological interpretation of estimated parameters, and uncertainties in model specification, in particular that of initiated cells. We also identify key uncertainties in the scale-up of the CIIT model to humans, focusing on assumptions underlying model parameters for cell replication rates and formaldehyde-induced mutation.

A sampling design based upon a systematic grid can adequately assess the condition of many types of resources and retain flexibility for addressing new issues as they arise. The randomization of this grid requires that it be regular and retain equal-area cells when projected on the surface of the earth. After review of existing approaches to constructing regular subdivisions of the earth's surface, we propose the development of the sampling grid on the Lambert azimuthal equal-area map projection of the earth's surface to the face of a truncated icosahedron fit to the globe. This geometric model has less deviation in area when subdivided as a spherical tessellation than any of the spherical Platonic solids, and less distortion in shape over the extent of a face when used for a projection surface by the Lambert azimuthal projection. A hexagon face of the truncated icosahedron covers the entire conterminous United States, and can be decomposed into a triangular grid at an appropriate density for sampling.

While pulmonary function decrements occur almost immediately after ozone exposure, it is not known how quickly the cellular and biochemical changes indicative of inflammation occur in humans. Changes in neutrophils and PGE2 have been observed in humans as early as 3 hr (28) and as late as 18 hr post exposure (19). The purpose of this study was to determine whether inflammatory changes occur relatively rapidly (within 1 hr) following exposure to ozone, or if the cascade of events which are initiated by ozone and lead to inflammation, take some time to develop. We exposed 10 healthy volunteers twice: once to filtered air and once to 0.4 ppm ozone. Each exposure lasted for 2 hr at an exercise level of 60 L/min, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 1 hr following exposure. The data from this study were compared to those from a previous study in which 10 subjects were exposed to O3 under identical conditions except that bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 18 hr following exposure. The results of the present study demonstrate that O3 is capable of inducing rapid cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. These changes were detectable as early as 1 hr following a 2 hr exposure of humans to ozone. The profiles of these changes were different at 1 hr and 18 hr following ozone exposures. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had levels of neutrophils, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 that were higher at 1 hr than at 18 hr post exposure. On the other hand, the levels of fibronectin and plasminogen activator were found to be higher at 18 hr than at 1 hr after ozone exposure. A temporal association appeared to exist between changes occurring in the biochemical markers and alterations in lung function. Further studies may be useful in determining if a causal relationship exists between these parameters.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP61,,12,Exposure of humans to ambient levels of ozone for 6.6 hours causes cellular and biochemical changes in the lung,American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology,1044-1549,"Devlin, RB; McDonnell, WF; Mann, R; Becker, S; House, DE; Schreinemachers, D; Koren, HS",,Jan-91,"US Environmental Protection Agency; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; ABB Environmental Services, Inc;",,"An acute (2 h) exposure of humans to 0.4 ppm ozone initiates biochemical changes in the lung that result in the production of components mediating inflammation and acute lung damage as well as components having the potential to lead to long-term effects such as fibrosis.

Therefore, it is important to determine if a prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone is also capable of causing cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. Nonsmoking males were randomly exposed to filtered air and either 0.10 ppm ozone or 0.08 ppm ozone for 6.6 h with moderate exercise (40 liters/min). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after each exposure, and cells and fluid were analyzed. The BAL fluid of volunteers exposed to 0.10 ppm ozone had significant increases in neutrophils (PMNs), protein, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with BAL fluid from the same volunteers exposed to filtered air. In addition, there was a decrease in the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytize yeast via the complement receptor. Exposure to 0.08 ppm ozone resulted in significant increases in PMNs, PGE2, LDH, IL-6, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and decreased phagocytosis via the complement receptor.

Combining a unique plant-level data set with industry-level demand information, we find that increased environmental spending generally does not cause a significant change in employment. Our average across all four industries is a net gain of 1.5 jobs per $1 million in additional environmental spending. with a standard error of 2.2 jobs-an economically and statistically insignificant effect. There are statistically significant and positive effects in two industries, but total number of affected jobs remains quite small. These small positive effects can be linked to labor-using factor shifts and relatively inelastic estimated demand.

Does EP harm the economy and destroy jobs or facilitate economic growth and create jobs? We address this issue by summarizing the results of the Jobs and the Environment Initiative, research funded by nonprofit foundations to quantify the relationship between EP, the economy, and jobs. We estimate the size of the US environmental industry and the numbers of environment-related jobs at the national level and in the states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin. This is the first time that such comprehensive, detailed estimates have been developed. Our major finding is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, EP, economic growth, and jobs creation are complementary and compatible: Investments in EP create jobs and displace jobs, but the net effect on employment is positive. Second, environment protection has grown rapidly to become a major sales-generating, job-creating industry-$300 billion/year and 5 million jobs in 2003. Third, most of the 5 million jobs created are standard jobs for accountants, engineers, computer analysts, clerks, factory workers, etc., and the classic environmental job (environmental engineer, ecologist, etc.) constitutes only a small portion of the jobs created. Most of the persons employed in the jobs created may not even realize that they owe their livelihood to protecting the environment. Fourth, Lit the state level, the relationship between environmental policies and economic/job growth is positive, not negative. States can have strong economics and simultaneously protect the environment. Finally, environmental jobs are concentrated in manufacturing and professional, information, scientific, and technical services, and are thus disproportionately the types of jobs all states seek to attract.

Sampled settings include stream basins that were agricultural, urbanized, undeveloped (forested, grassland, shrubland, and wetland land cover), and mined (for gold and Hg). Each site was sampled one time during seasonal low flow. Predator fish were targeted for collection, and composited samples of fish (primarily skin-off fillets) were analyzed for total Hg (THg), as most of the Hg found in fish tissue (95–99 percent) is MeHg. Samples of bed sediment and stream water were analyzed for THg, MeHg, and characteristics thought to affect Hg methylation, such as loss-on-ignition (LOI, a measure of organic matter content) and acid-volatile sulfide in bed sediment, and pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved sulfate in water. Fish-Hg concentrations at 27 percent of sampled sites exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency human-health criterion of 0.3 micrograms per gram wet weight. Exceedances were geographically widespread, although the study design targeted specific sites and fish species and sizes, so results do not represent a true nationwide percentage of exceedances. The highest THg concentrations in fish were from blackwater coastal-plain streams draining forests or wetlands in the eastern and southeastern United States, as well as from streams draining gold- or Hg-mined basins in the western United States (1.80 and 1.95 micrograms THg per gram wet weight, respectively). For unmined basins, length-normalized Hg concentrations in largemouth bass were significantly higher in fish from predominantly undeveloped or mixed-land-use basins compared to urban basins. Hg concentrations in largemouth bass from unmined basins were correlated positively with basin percentages of evergreen forest and also woody wetland, especially with increasing proximity of these two land-cover types to the sampling site; this underscores the greater likelihood for Hg bioaccumulation to occur in these types of settings. Increasing concentrations of MeHg in unfiltered stream water, and of bed-sediment MeHg normalized by LOI, and decreasing pH and dissolved sulfate were also important in explaining increasing Hg concentrations in largemouth bass. MeHg concentrations in bed sediment correlated positively with THg, LOI, and acid-volatile sulfide. Concentrations of MeHg in water correlated positively with DOC, ultraviolet absorbance, and THg in water, the percentage of MeHg in bed sediment, and the percentage of wetland in the basin.

In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (Circulation. 2010; 121: 2331-2378.)

Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.

Similarly, the delay between changes in exposure and changes in health is also important in public health decision making. We addressed these issues using an extended follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities Study.METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were fit controlling for smoking, body mass index, and other covariates. Two approaches were used. First, we used penalized splines, which fit a flexible functional form to the concentration response to examine its shape, and chose the degrees of freedom for the curve based on Akaike's information criterion. Because the uncertainties around the resultant curve do not reflect the uncertainty in model choice, we also used model averaging as an alternative approach, where multiple models are fit explicitly and averaged, weighted by their probability of being correct given the data. We examined the lag relationship by model averaging across a range of unconstrained distributed lag models.RESULTS: We found that the concentration-response curve is linear, clearly continuing below the current U.S. standard of 15 mu g/m(3), and that the effects of changes in exposure on mortality are seen within two years.CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in particle concentrations below U.S. EPA standards would increase life expectancy.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP90,,1,Reduction in fine particulate air pollution and mortality -Extended follow-up of the Harvard six cities study,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1073-449X,"Laden, F; Schwartz, J; Speizer, FE; Dockery, DW",10.1164/rccm.200503-443OC,15-Mar-06,Harvard School of Public Health; Harvard Medical School,US Environmental Protection Agency; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,"Rationale: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95).Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.

Although it is widely hypothesized that incroased Hg load to aquatic ecosystems leads to increases in MeHg in fish, there is limited quantitative data to test this hypothesis. Here we examine the available evidence from a range of sources: studies of ecosystems contaminated by industrial discharges, observations of fish MeHg responses to changes in atmospheric load, studies over space and environmental gradients, and experimental manipulations. A summary of the current understanding of the main processes involved in the transport and transformation from Hg load to MeHg in fish is provided. The role of Hg loading is discussed in context with other factors affecting Hg cycling and bioaccumulation in relation to timing and magnitude of response in fish MoHg. The main conclusion drawn is that changes in Hg loading (increase or decrease) will yield a response in fish MeHg but that the timing and magnitude of the response will vary depending of ecosystem-specific variables and the form of the Hg loaded.",Scholarly Journal,2060-AP90,,1,Deposition and cycling of sulfur controls mercury accumulation in Isle Royal fish ,Environmental Science and Technology,0013-936X,"Drevnick, PE; Canfield, DE; Gorski, PR; Shinneman, ALC; Engstrom, DR; Muir, DCG; Smith, GR; Garrison, PJ; Cleckner, LB; Hurley, JP; Noble, RB; Otter, RR; Oris, JT",10.1021/es0712322,1-Nov-07,Miami University (Ohio); University of Southern Denmark; University of Wisconsin; University of Minnesota; Science Museum of Minnesota; Environment Canada; University of Michigan; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,Miami University; Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study; Danish National Research Foundation; US Environmental Protection Agency,"Mercury contamination of fish is a global problem.

However, factors other than mercury deposition are important for mercury bioaccumulation in fish. In the lakes of Isle Royale, U.S.A., reduced rates of sulfate deposition since the Clean Air Act of 1970 have caused mercury concentrations in fish to decline to levels that are safe for human consumption, even without a discernible decrease in mercury deposition.

We hypothesized that this paradox could be in part explained by high mercury content in fish.Methods and Results We studied the relation of the dietary intake of fish and mercury, as well as hair content and urinary excretion of mercury, to the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death from CHD, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and any cause in 1833 men aged 42 to 60 years who were free of clinical CHD, stroke, claudication, and cancer. Of these, 73 experienced an AMI in 2 to 7 years. Of the 78 deceased men, 18 died of CHD and 24 died of CVD. Men who had consumed local nonfatty fish species had elevated hair mercury contents. In Cox models with the major cardiovascular risk factors as covariates, dietary intakes of fish and mercury were associated with significantly increased risk of AMI and death from CHD, CVD, and any death. Men in the highest tertile (greater than or equal to 2.0 mu g/g) of hair mercury content had a 2.0-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.1; P=.005) age- and CHD-adjusted risk of AMI and a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 6.6; P=.014) adjusted risk of cardiovascular death compared with those with a lower hair mercury content. In a nested case-control subsample, the 24-hour urinary mercury excretion had a significant (P=.042) independent association with the risk of AMI. Both the hair and urinary mercury associated significantly with titers of immune complexes containing oxidized LDL.Conclusions These data suggest that a high intake of mercury from nonfatty freshwater fish and the consequent accumulation of mercury in the body are associated with an excess risk of AMI as well as death from CHD, CVD, and any cause in Eastern Finnish men and this increased risk may be due to the promotion of lipid peroxidation by mercury.

This article compares numerically estimated expected values of key aggregate economic variables for two levels of target prices (i. e. supported price level) from deterministic and stochastic formulations of AGSIM, which is a large-scale econometric simulation model of crop and livestock production in the United States.For nominal target prices set by the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Bill (FACT), the deterministic formulation underestimated the level of deficiency payments (the difference between target price and market price) by a cumulative total of $800 million (6.2%) over the 5 year life of the Bill compared to estimates from the stochastic model. For target prices 10% below the FACT levels, the deterministic model underestimated deficiency payments by $1220 million (36.8%). Much of the economic impact estimation bias can be attributed to price received by participating producers under FACT having a probability distribution truncated at the target price, which is a strong departure from the certainty equivalent requirements needed to have mean outcomes from stochastic models equal outcomes from their deterministic counterpart.Estimated changes in deficiency payments from lowering target prices by 10% were overestimated by $420 million (4.3%) with the deterministic model, which suggests that deterministic models are less biased for estimating the change in deficiency payments than in estimating the level of payments.

More refined assessment has been limited by study size and available air quality data.Methods: Measurements of 5 pollutants (particulate matter [PM10] ozone, nitrogen dioxide [NO2] carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) were available for the entire study period (I January 1993 to 31 August 2000); detailed measurements of particulate matter were available for 25 months. We obtained data on 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. Visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, and pneumonia were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized estimating equations.Results: In single-pollutant models examining 3-day moving averages of pollutants (lags 0, 1, and 2): standard deviation increases of ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with 1-3% increases in UR1 visits; a 2 mug/m(3) increase of PM2.5 organic carbon was associated with a 3% increase in pneumonia visits; and standard deviation increases of NO2 and CO were associated with 2-3% increases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits.

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of more than 1 million deaths in 14 U.S. cities. Main results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10-ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% Cl 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months. Conclusions: The association between ozone and mortality risk is unlikely to be caused by confounding by temperature.

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers.Methods: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances.Results: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-mu g/m(3) increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5.Conclusions: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be antici-pated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses.

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22).

In the second stage, we specify a class of distributions for the true city-specific relative rates to estimate an overall effect by taking into account the variability within and across cities. We perform the calculations with respect to several random effects distributions (normal, t-student, and mixture of normal), thus relaxing the common assumption of a two-stage normal-normal hierarchical model. We assess the sensitivity of the results to: (i) lag structure for ozone exposure; (ii) degree of adjustment for long-term trends; (iii) inclusion of other pollutants in the model; (iv) heat waves; (v) random effects distributions; and (vi) prior hyperparameters.On average across cities, we found that a 10ppb increase in summer ozone level over the previous week is associated with a 1.25 per cent increase in CVDRESP mortality (95 per cent posterior regions: 0.47, 2.03). The relative rate estimates are also positive and statistically significant at lags 0, 1 and 2. We found that associations between summer ozone and CVDRESP mortality are sensitive to the confounding adjustment for PM10, but are robust to: (i) the adjustment for long-term trends, other gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 and CO); (ii) the distributional assumptions at the second stage of the hierarchical model; and (iii) the prior distributions on all unknown parameters.Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models and their application to the NMMAPS data allow us to estimate of an acute health effect associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in the last few days on average across several locations. The application of these methods and the systematic assessment of the sensitivity of findings to model assumptions provide important epidemiological evidence for future air quality regulations.

Adjusting for the funnel plot asymmetry resulted in a slightly reduced estimate (0.35%; 0.23-0.47%). In a subset for which particulate matter (PM) data were available (15 studies), the corresponding estimates were 0.40% (0.27-0.53%) for ozone alone and 0.37% (0.20-0.54%) with PM in model. The estimates for warm seasons were generally larger than those for cold seasons. Our additional time-series analysis found that including PM in the model did not substantially reduce the ozone risk estimates. However, the difference in the weather adjustment model could result in a 2-fold difference in risk estimates (eg, 0.24% to 0.49% in multicity combined estimates across alternative weather models for the ozone-only all-year case).Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest short-term associations between ozone and daily mortality in the majority of the cities, although the estimates appear to be heterogeneous across cities.

Here we present the major findings from a national scale air pollution assessment that is part of the United States' 2003 Report on Sustainable Forests. We examine trends and the percent forest subjected to specific levels of ozone and wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Results are reported by Resource Planning Act (RPA) reporting region and integrated by forest type using multivariate clustering. Estimates of sulfate deposition for forested areas had decreasing trends (1994-2000) across RPA regions that were statistically significant for North and South RPA regions. Nitrate deposition rates were relatively constant for the 1994 to 2000 period, but the South RPA region had a statistically decreasing trend. The North and South RPA regions experienced the highest ammonium deposition rates and showed slightly decreasing trends. Ozone concentrations were highest in portions of the Pacific Coast RPA region and relatively high across much of the South RPA region. Both the South and Rocky Mountain RPA regions had an increasing trend in ozone exposure. Ozone-induced foliar injury to sensitive species was recorded in all regions except for the Rocky Mountain region. The multivariate analysis showed that the oak-hickory and loblolly-shortleaf pine forest types were generally exposed to more air pollution than other forest types, and the redwood, western white pine, and larch forest types were generally exposed to less. These findings offer a new approach to national air pollution assessments and are intended to help focus research and planning initiatives related to air pollution and forest health.

The purpose of this article is to develop four ideas that are currently emerging from the work of a diverse group of plant scientists. (1) Air pollution definitions: The definition of air pollution has been broadened, and research activities are expanding to include analysis of plant responses to a wide range of atmospheric chemicals emitted from anthropogenic sources but not previously considered as air pollutants. Thus experiments with CO2 and other trace gases are being pursued with approaches developed in air pollution research. (2) Air pollution uptake: Efforts are increasing to better quantify air pollution absorption rates through stomata in order to calculate actual dose vs, plant responses. The flux rates of gaseous pollutants into leaves, especially O-3, are largely dependent upon stomatal conductance. Approaches are being developed to calculate stomatal absorption of gaseous pollutants, based on stomatal conductance values for water vapor and ambient air-pollution concentrations. Calculation of air pollution absorption rates will allow responses of plants to pollutants to be assessed in toxicological frameworks and will help characterize the strength of vegetation as sinks for some gaseous pollutants. (3) Compensatory responses: Plant responses to air pollutants can be interpreted as compensatory, i.e., a physiological adjustment to an environmental stress that maximizes productivity above that which would have occurred in the absence of compensation. Examples of compensatory responses to air pollutants are shifts in root-to-shoot ratio and accelerated rates of leaf maturation. Recognition of compensatory responses to air pollutants allows these responses to be placed in a framework that relates to whole-plant processes and ecosystem functions. (4) Air pollution and multiple stresses: Air pollution stress seldom occurs in isolation, and research approaches are being developed around the concept of multiple interacting stresses. Multiple-stress experiments are important because factors such as plant water status, light, and nutrient availability are known to alter plant responses to air pollutants. Multiple-stress studies will involve experiments with model plant species and high degrees of environmental control and monitoring.

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes.Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are lessthan/equal 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter [PM(sub 2.5)]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models.Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM(sub 2.5) or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM(sub 2.5) was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used.Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM(sub 2.5) was taken into account. We did, however, demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory causes in association with an increase in ozone concentration.

The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have biological significance. Any assessment of ozone stress in the forest environment must include both biomonitoring (i. e., plant response) and air quality data to be complete.

Seasonal variability was removed from all variables using nonparametric smoothed function (LOESS) of day of study. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the effect of elevated levels of pollutants on ER visits. Relative risks of pollutants are reported over their interquartile range (IQR, the 75th-25th percentile pollutant values). In Portland, an IQR increase in SO2 was associated with a 5% (95% CI 2-7%) increase in all respiratory ER visits and a 6% (95% CI 1-12%) increase in asthma visits. An IQR increase in O-3 was associated with a 5% (95% Cl 1-10%) increase in Portland asthmatic ER visits. No significant associations were found in Manchester, New Hampshire, possibly due to statistical limitations of analyzing a smaller population. The absence of statistical evidence for a relationship should not be used as evidence of no relationship. This analysis reveals that, on a daily basis, elevated SO2 and O-3 have a significant impact on public health in Portland, Maine. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We compared results with pooled estimates from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), a time-series study of 95 large U.S. urban centers from 1987 to 2000.Results: Both meta-analysis and NMMAPS results provided strong evidence of a short-term association between ozone and mortality, with larger effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, the elderly, and current-day ozone exposure. In both analyses, results were insensitive to adjustment for particulate matter and model specifications. In the meta-analysis, a 10-ppb increase in daily ozone at single-day or 2-day average of lags 0, 1, or 2 days was associated with an 0.87% increase in total mortality (95% posterior interval = 0.55% to 1.18%), whereas the lag 0 NMMAPS estimate is 0.25% (0.12% to 0.39%). Several findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS; meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger than with NMMAPS.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-today variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.Objective To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.Design and Setting Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.Main Outcome Measure Daily counts of total non-injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.Results A 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day's exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.Conclusions These results indicate a statistically significant association between short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban communities, which include about 40% of the total US population. The findings indicate that this widespread pollutant adversely affects public health.

Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively, Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.

Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million (ill 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ""best practice"" assumptions are invoked.

The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations.Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors.Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95% Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111, 1.27; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95% Cl, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.95).Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.

Numerous epidemiological and toxicological studies have evaluated the PM2.5-mortality association and investigated issues that may contribute to uncertainty in the concentration-response (C-R) function, such as exposure misclassification and potential confounding from other pollutant exposures. EPA's current uncertainty analysis methods rely largely on standard errors in published studies. However, no one study tan capture the full suite of issues that arise in quantifying the C-R relationship. Therefore, EPA has applied state-of-the-art expert judgment elicitation techniques to develop probabilistic uncertainty distributions that reflect the broader array of uncertainties in the C-R relationship. These distributions, elicited from 12 of the world's leading experts on this issue, suggest both potentially larger central estimates of mortality reductions for decreases in long-term PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. and a wider distribution of uncertainty than currently employed in EPA analyses.

This paper examines how each of these factors influences the magnitude of the $/ton estimate. We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.

It was hypothesized that cognitive performance would improve as blood lead level declined over time.Design.-Short-term intervention study with measures obtained before and after intervention.Setting.-Hospital specialty clinic and university research center.Patients.-A total of 154 previously untreated children referred to clinic with blood lead levels between 1.21 and 2.66 mumol/L (25 and 55 mug/dL) at time of enrollment. Ages ranged from 13 to 87 months.Intervention.-Enrolled children were treated with edetate calcium disodium (EDTA) if eligible and/or with orally administered iron supplement if iron deficient. For all children, housing inspections and abatement procedures were performed as necessary.Main Outcome Measures.-Score on Bayley Mental Development Scale or Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (4th edition).Results.-There was no effect of edetate calcium disodium treatment per se. In the short term (7 weeks), changes in blood lead levels were not related to changes in cognitive scores. In the long term (6 months), however, changes in performance were significantly related to changes in blood lead level, even after controlling for confounding variables. The standardized score increased 1 point for every decrease of 0.14 mumol/L (3 mug/dL) in blood lead level.Conclusion.-The results suggest an association between decreases in blood lead level and cognitive improvements in moderately lead-poisoned children.

Information on demographics, past and current health, and past exposures to neurotoxicants, and responses to the Swedish Q16 questionnaire were collected by interview. Standard neurobehavioural and neurophysiological tests were administered by computer or trained technicians. K x ray fluorescence was used to estimate tibial bone lead concentrations among the exposed and unexposed groups. Associations were examined between the exposed group and referents and tibial bone lead concentration and the neurobehavioural and neurophysiological outcomes of interest.Results-Among the measures of peripheral nerve function, after controlling for confounders, sural sensory nerve evoked response amplitude, peroneal motor nerve compound motor action potential amplitude, vibrotactile thresholds of fingers and toes, and standing steadiness were significantly associated with exposure group. Among the neurobehavioural tests, hand-eye coordination, simple reaction time latency, trails B latency, symbol digit latency, serial digit, and learning error score were also significantly associated with exposure group after controlling for confounders. Exposed subjects had significantly more neuropsychiatric symptoms than the referents. Associations between tibial bone lead concentration and scores for vocabulary, vibrotactile thresholds of the fingers, and vibrotactile thresholds of the toes approached significance.Conclusions-Significant adverse central and peripheral neurological effects were found in a group of young adults 20 years after childhood environmental exposure to lead when compared with non-exposed controls. The absence of a significant association between neurological outcomes and tibial bone lead concentration, and the presence of significant associations between neurological outcomes and exposure group may be due to either the magnitude of measurement uncertainty in K Lt. ray films relative to the actual tibial bone lead concentration in these young non-occupationally exposed subjects, or uncontrolled confounding of the exposure group. `",Scholarly Journal,2070-AJ57,,12,Construction Work Practices and Conditions Improved After 2-Years’ Participation in the HomeSafe Pilot Program,American Industrial Hygiene Association,1529-8663,"Gilkey, DP; Haultaluoma, JE; Ahmed, TP; Keefe, TJ; Herron, RE; Bigelow, PL",10.1080/15428110308984826 ,3-Jun,Colorado State University; Florida A&M University,National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,"This study reevaluated changes in job-site safety audit scores for a cohort of residential construction workers that had protracted exposure to the HomeSafe pilot program for 2 1/2 years.

It is not known whether treatment to reduce blood lead levels prevents or reduces such impairment.Methods: We enrolled 780 children with blood lead levels of 20 to 44 mug per deciliter (1.0 to 2.1 mu mol per liter) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of up to three 26-day courses of treatment with succimer, a lead chelator that is administered orally. The children lived in deteriorating inner-city housing and were 12 to 33 months of age at enrollment; 77 percent were black, and 5 percent were Hispanic. Follow-up included tests of cognitive, motor, behavioral, and neuropsychological function over a period of 36 months.Results: During the first six months of the trial, the mean blood lead level in the children given succimer was 4.5 mug per deciliter (0.2 mu mol per liter) lower than the mean level in the children given placebo (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 5.3 mug per deciliter [0.2 to 0.3 mu mol per liter]). At 36 months of follow-up, the mean IQ score of children given succimer was 1 point lower than that of children given placebo, and the behavior of children given succimer was slightly worse as rated by a parent. However, the children given succimer scored slightly better on the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, a battery of tests designed to measure neuropsychological deficits thought to interfere with learning. All these differences were small, and none were statistically significant.Conclusions: Treatment with succimer lowered blood lead levels but did not improve scores on tests of cognition, behavior, or neuropsychological function in children with blood lead levels below 45 mug per deciliter. Since succimer is as effective as any lead chelator currently available, chelation therapy is not indicated for children with these blood lead levels. (N Engl J Med 2001;344:1421-6.)

We have reviewed the literature of the past 45 years, which revealed 70 cases involving cats. Sources, signs, diagnosis, pathology and treatment of feline lead toxicosis are reviewed.In 84%, of these cases the source of lead was old paint usually from home renovation. The most common signs in cats are anorexia, vomiting, and seizures. The younger individuals seem more likely to show CNS signs. Since signs are often vague, lead toxicosis may be significantly under diagnosed in cats. The gold standard of diagnostic tests is blood lead concentration, although it does not necessarily correlate with total body burden of lead or with metabolic effects including clinical signs. Diagnostic tests including erythropoietic protoporphyrin (EPP), urine aminolevulinic acid, and others are discussed. Gross findings on necropsy are few and include a yellow-brown discoloration of the liver often with a nutmeg-like appearance. Histological examination may reveal pathognomonic inclusion bodies in liver and renal tissues. Characteristic histological changes in the CNS include neuronal necrosis and demyelination.Treatment of lead toxicosis in cats, as in any species, involves removing the exposure, decontaminating the individual and the environment, supportive care and chelation therapy. The most recently available chelator is succimer (meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid). Succimer given orally is well tolerated and has a wide margin of safety.A high index of suspicion of lead toxicosis is warranted in cats since they often present with vague and non-specific signs. With any consistent history owners need to be asked about home renovation. Early diagnosis and treatment affords a good prognosis. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ESFM and AAFP.

Some children in the United States continue to be exposed to levels of lead that increase their risk for lowered intellectual functioning and behavior problems. It is unclear whether chelation therapy can prevent or reverse the neurodevelopmental sequelae of lead toxicity. The objective of this study was to determine whether chelation therapy with succimer ( dimercaptosuccinic acid) in children with referral blood lead levels between 20 and 44 mug/dL (0.96-2.12 mumol/L) at 12 to 33 months of age has neurodevelopmental benefits at age 7 years.Methods. The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted between September 1994 and June 2003 in Philadelphia, PA; Newark, NJ; Cincinnati, OH; and Baltimore, MD. Of 1854 referred children who were between the ages of 12 to 33 months and screened for eligibility, 780 were randomized to the active drug and placebo groups stratified by clinical center, body surface area, blood lead level, and language spoken at home. At 7 years of age, 647 subjects remained in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral succimer or placebo. Up to 3 26-day courses of succimer or placebo therapy were administered depending on response to treatment in those who were given active drug. Eighty-nine percent had finished treatment by 6 months, with all children finishing by 13 months after randomization. All participants received residential lead hazard control measures before treatment. TLC subjects also received a daily multivitamin supplement before and after treatment(s) with succimer or placebo. Scores on standardized neuropsychological measures that tap cognition, behavior, learning and memory, attention, and neuromotor skills were measured.Results. Chelation therapy with succimer lowered average blood lead levels for similar to 6 months but resulted in no benefit in cognitive, behavioral, and neuromotor endpoints.Conclusion. These new follow-up data confirm our previous finding that the TLC regimen of chelation therapy is not associated with neurodevelopmental benefits in children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 mug/dL (0.96 - 2.17 mumol/L). These results emphasize the importance of taking environmental measures to prevent exposure to lead. Chelation therapy with succimer cannot be recommended for children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 mug/dL ( 0.96 - 2.12 mumol/L).

All of the 850 boys who scored in the upper 30th percentile of the distribution on a self-reported antisocial behavior scale were matched with an equal number drawn by lot from the lower 70% of the distribution. From this sample, 301 students accepted the invitation to participate.Exposure Measure.-K x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy of tibia at subjects' age of 12 years.Main Outcome Measures.-Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), teachers' and parents' reports, and subjects' self-report of antisocial behavior and delinquency at 7 and 11 years of age.Results.-Subjects, teachers, and parents were blind to the bone lead measurements. At 7 years of age, borderline associations between teachers' aggression, delinquency, and externalizing scores and lead levels were observed after adjustment for covariates. At 11 years of age, parents reported a significant lead-related association with the following CBCL cluster scores: somatic complaints and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior. Teachers reported significant associations of lead with somatic complaints, anxious/depressed behavior, social problems, attention problems, and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior. High-lead subjects reported; higher scores in subjects' self-reports of delinquency at 11 years. High-lead subjects were more likely to obtain worse scores on all items of the CBCL during the 4-year period of observation. High bone lead levels were associated with an increased risk of exceeding the clinical score (T>70) for attention, aggression, and delinquency.Conclusion.-Lead exposure is associated with increased risk for antisocial and delinquent behavior, and the effect follows a developmental course.

Latent heterogeneity is econometrically important and affects the estimated VSL. Our findings indicate that a reasonable average cost per expected life saved cut-off for health and safety regulations is $7 million to $8 million per life saved, but the VSL varies considerably across the labor force. Our results reconcile the previous discrepancies between hedonic VSL estimates and the values implied by theories linked to the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Because the VSL varies elastically with income, regulatory agencies should regularly update the VSL used in benefit assessments, increasing the VSL proportionally with changes in income over time.

New estimates of the income elasticity of VSL are 1.0 or above, which are consistent with theoretical models linking VSL to the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The specific relationship between VSL and risk aversion is, however, more complex than previously understood. Age differences in VSL are substantial, with young children being accorded especially high VSL amounts. The public's willingness to pay to reduce risks is reduced if those being protected are perceived as being blameworthy due to their responsibility for contributing to the risk.

Results of our analysis of 143 study coefficients and a total sample size of 1,932 suggest that overall sleep deprivation strongly impairs human functioning. Moreover, we found that mood is more affected by sleep deprivation than either cognitive or motor performance and that partial sleep deprivation has a more profound effect on functioning than either long-term or short-term sleep deprivation. In general, these results indicate that the effects of sleep deprivation may be underestimated in some narrative reviews, particularly those concerning the effects of partial sleep deprivation.

These components are (1) a homeostatic component (H) that falls in a sigmoidal manner during wake and rises in a saturating exponential manner at a rate that is determined by circadian phase during sleep; (2) a circadian component (C) that is a function of the output of our mathematical model of the effect of Light on the circadian pacemaker, with the amplitude further regulated by the level of H; and (3) a sleep inertia component (W) that rises in a saturating exponential manner after waketime. The authors first construct initial models of subjective alertness and cognitive throughput based on the results of sleep inertia studies, sleep deprivation studies initiated across all circadian phases, 28-h forced desynchrony studies, and alertness and performance dose response curves to sleep. These initial models are then refined using data from nearly one hundred fifty 30- to 50-h sleep deprivation studies in which subjects woke at their habitual times. The interactive three-component models presented here are able to predict even the fine details of neurobehavioral data from sleep deprivation studies and, after further validation, may provide a powerful tool for the design of safe shift work and travel schedules, including those in which people are exposed to unusual patterns of light.

However, it has been suggested that, for example, the effects of sleep loss need a rather long time on task to become evident. The present experiment examined when significant deterioration of performance occurred in a 34-min visual vigilance task (with 32 signals) given to twelve subjects every 3 h across 64 h without sleep. Results from the whole test, the first eight signals, and even the first signal varied significantly across the experiment and were significantly lower than baseline after 24 h awake. The rate of decline over time on task was similar across the experiment. Less than half the misses could be attributed to electrophysiologically defined sleepiness. It was concluded that there is no ""safe"" duration of a monotonous task if the situation is undemanding and boring, but that the effect may become immediately evident. This may have practical implications in terms of safety.

The electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were analyzed with spectral analysis. Subjective sleepiness increased during the night work but did not reach an extreme level. Five subjects fell asleep during night work and the involuntary naps were preceded by a few minutes of increased alpha (8-11.9 Hz) power density. Alpha and theta activity occurred in very short bursts. The hourly mean EEG alpha power density increased significantly but moderately during the night shift and correlated with subjective ratings of sleepiness. Theta power density (4-7.9 Hz) did not increase during the night shift, nor did it correlate with subjective sleepiness. It was suggested that the shift workers could prevent much of the polysomnographic manifestations of sleepiness by various types of activity (including succumbing to sleep). It was also suggested that averaging power density values across long time periods might not be an optimal strategy for detection of sleepiness, but rather some method of emphasizing the occurrence of alpha or theta bursts.

The procedure explicitly considers whether a driver is on duty or off duty for each half hour of each day during the period of analysis. From a data set of over 1,000 drivers, nine distinct driving patterns are identified. Membership in the patterns is determined exclusively by the pattern of duty hours for seven consecutive days; for some drivers an accident occurred on the eighth day while others had no accident, therefore each pattern can be associated with a relative accident risk. Additional statistical modeling allowed the consideration, in addition to driving pattern, of driver age. experience with the firm, hours off duty prior to the last trip and hours driving on the last trip (either until the accident or successful completion of the trip). The finding of the modeling is that driving patterns over the previous seven days significantly affect accident risk on the eighth day. In general, driving during the early and late morning (e.g. midnight to 10 A.M.) has the highest accident risk while all seven other multiday patterns had indistinguishable fisk. Consecutive hours driven also has a significant effect on accident fisk: the first hour through the fourth hour having the lowest fisk with a fluctuating increase in risk to a maximum beyond nine hours. Driver age and hours off duty immediately prior to a trip do not appear to affect accident fisk significantly. These findings quantitatively assess the relative accident fisk of multiday driving patterns using data from actual truck operations. Further research is recommended in the areas of refining model structures, adding explanatory variables (such as highway type), and testing more complex models.

Hypothesized predictor variables related to drivers' typical work and rest patterns, extent of daytime and night-time drowsiness, symptoms of sleep disorder, measures of driving exposure, and demographic characteristics. A sizeable proportion of long-distance truck drivers reported falling asleep at the wheel of the truck: 47.1% of the survey respondents had ever fallen asleep at the wheel of a truck, and 25.4% had fallen asleep at the wheel in the past year. Factor analysis reduced the large set of predictors to six underlying, independent factors: greater daytime sleepiness; more arduous schedules, with more hours of work and fewer hours off-duty; older, more experienced drivers; shorter, poorer sleep on road; symptoms of sleep disorder; and greater tendency to night-time drowsy driving. Based on multivariate logistic regression, all six factors were predictive of self-reported falling asleep at the wheel. Falling asleep was also associated with not having been alerted by driving over shoulder rumble strips. The results suggest that countermeasures that limit drivers' work hours and enable drivers to get adequate rest and that identify drivers with sleep disorders are appropriate methods to reduce sleepiness-related driving by truck drivers.

Subjects in the regularity group received an additional instruction to keep a regular sleep schedule. The study was longitudinal and prospective. Following a baseline period (12 days), the experimental conditions were introduced. The experimental phase lasted 4 weeks and overall compliance was good. A follow-up phase (1 week) began 5 weeks past termination of the experimental phase. The findings indicated that when nocturnal sleep is not deprived, regularization of sleep-wake schedules is associated with reduced reported sleepiness. Subjects in the regular schedule condition reported greater and longer lasting improvements in alertness compared with subjects in the sleep only condition and reported improved sleep efficiency.

This paper investigates the specific contribution of electronic logbooks to improving firm safety performance (as measured by the number of crashes and hours of service violations). The models presented demonstrate that electronic logbooks contribute positively to crash reduction and to decreases in hours of service violations, particularly among carriers with poor overall safety records. Moreover, hours of service violations fully mediate the relationship between electronic logbook use and number of crashes. These results have policy significance as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has proposed a rule that would require the use of electronic logbooks for some carriers.

Macro-analyses confirmed the presence of a clear circadian (ca 24 hour) rhythm in road accident risk with a major peak at ca 03:00 but suggested that this rhythm could not be entirely accounted for in terms of drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Sleep propensity clearly shows a pronounced circadian rhythm and performance efficiency in wakeful subjects shows a similar trend implying that the 03:00 road accident peak may simply reflect lowered performance capabilities. However, there are 'residual' peaks in accidents at certain times of day that are difficult to account for in terms of circadian rhythmicity. It is suggested that these may reflect a time on task effect which shows a pronounced, but transient, 2-4 hour peak in risk. Only when individuals had been on duty for 12 hours or more did the risk exceed that found during the 2-4 hour peak. While an explanation for this transient peak is offered, the underlying reason for it is, as yet, uncertain and clearly warrants investigation in view of its practical implications. It is concluded that there are 'black times' when accidents are far more likely and that there is a strong need to investigate possible countermeasures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Other data document that 1) 17%-57% of normal young adults have MSLT latencies of less than or equal to 5.5 minutes, whereas less than or equal to 50% have MSLT values of greater than or equal to 10 minutes and 2) 28%-29% of young adults reported normally sleeping less than or equal to 6.5 hours on each weeknight. More extensive reduction of daily sleep amount is seen in night-shift workers. A minimum of 2%-4% of middle-aged adults have hypersomnolence associated with sleep apnea. Together, these data show that significant sleep loss exists in one-third or more of normal adults, that the effects are large and replicable and that similar effects can be produced in just 1 night in the laboratory. In light of the magnitude of this sleep debt, it is not surprising that fatigue is a factor in 57% of accidents leading to the death of a truck driver and in 10% of fatal car accidents and results in costs of up to 56 billion dollars per year. A recent sleep extension study suggests that the average underlying sleep tendency in young adults is about 8.5 hours per night. By comparison, the average reported sleep length of 7.2-7.4 hours is deficient, and common sleep lengths of less than or equal to 6.5 hours can be disastrous. We must recognize the alertness function of sleep and the increasing consequences of sleepiness with the same vigor that we have come to recognize the societal impact of alcohol.

Methods: One hundred and three professional truck drivers participated in a long-term naturalistic (on-road) driving study whereby vehicle motion data as well as video of the driver and driving environment were gathered continuously. This data set was analyzed to identify safety-critical events as well as fatigued driving episodes using two independent measures of fatigue. Odds ratio analyses were then performed to explore the relative risk of driving while fatigued and involvement in safety-critical events based on driver's BMI classification (obese versus non-obese). Results: Results indicated that of the 103 participating truck drivers, 53.4 percent were obese based on BMI. Odds ratio calculations revealed that obese individuals were between 1.22 (CI = 1.03-1.45) and 1.69 times (CI = 1.32-2.18) more likely than non-obese individuals to be rated as fatigued based on the two measures of fatigue.

Finally, one of the fatigue measures showed that obese individuals were 1.99 times (CI = 1.02-3.88) more likely than non-obese individuals to be fatigued while involved in an at-fault safety-critical incident.

The procedure explicitly considers whether a driver is on duty or off duty for each half hour of each day during the period of analysis. From a data set of over 1,000 drivers, nine distinct driving patterns are identified. Membership in the patterns is determined exclusively by the pattern of duty hours for seven consecutive days; for some drivers an accident occurred on the eighth day while others had no accident, therefore each pattern can be associated with a relative accident risk. Additional statistical modeling allowed the consideration, in addition to driving pattern, of driver age. experience with the firm, hours off duty prior to the last trip and hours driving on the last trip (either until the accident or successful completion of the trip). The finding of the modeling is that driving patterns over the previous seven days significantly affect accident risk on the eighth day. In general, driving during the early and late morning (e.g. midnight to 10 A.M.) has the highest accident risk while all seven othermultiday patterns had indistinguishable fisk. Consecutive hours driven also has a significant effect on accident fisk: the first hour through the fourth hour having the lowest fisk with a fluctuating increase in risk to a maximum beyond nine hours. Driver age and hours off duty immediately prior to a trip do not appear to affect accident fisk significantly. These findings quantitatively assess the relative accident fisk of multiday drivingpatterns using data from actual truck operations. Further research is recommended in the areas of refining model structures, adding explanatory variables (such as highway type), and testing more complex models.",Scholarly Journal,2126-AB26,,13,Modeling the Impact of the Components of Long Work Hours on Injuries and “Accidents”,"American Journal of Industrial Medicine, Vol. 49 No. 11",0271-3586,"Folkard, S.; Lombardi, D.",10.1002/ajim.20307,2006,"Université Paris Descartes, Faculté de Médecine, Laboratoire d'Anthropolgie Appliqué; Body Rhythms and Shiftwork Centre, University of Wales Swansea; Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety",,"Background Many of the industrial disasters of the last few decades, including Three Mile island, Chernobyl, Bhopal, Exxon Valdez, and the Estoniaferry, have occurred in the early hours of the morning.

We investigated associations of sleep duration and change in sleep duration with all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study. Data are from baseline (Phase 1, 198588) and Phase 3 (1991-93), with mortality follow-up of 17 and 12 years respectively. Setting: The Whitehall 11 study of 10,308 white-collar British civil servants aged 35-55 at baseline. Participants: 9,781 participants with complete data were included in the analyses at Phase 1, and 7,729 of the same participants were includedin the analyses at Phase 3 and the analyses of change in sleep duration. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results U-shaped associations were observed between sleep (<= 5, 6, 7, 8, >= 9 hours) at Phase 1 and Phase 3 and subsequent all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular mortality. A decrease in sleep duration among participants sleeping 6, 7, or 8 hours at baseline was associated with cardiovascular mortality, hazard ratio 2.4 (95% confidence intervals 1.4-4.1). However, an increase insleep duration among those sleeping 7 or 8 hours at baseline was associated with non-cardiovascular mortality, hazard ratio 2.1 (1.4-3.1). Adjustment for the socio-demographic factors, existing morbidity, and health-related behaviours measured left these associations largely unchanged. Conclusions This is the first study to show that both a decrease in sleep duration and an increase in sleep duration are associated with an increase in mortality via effects on cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death respectively.",Scholarly Journal,2126-AB26,,13,The Impact of Overweight and Obesity on the Direct Medical Costs of Truck Drivers,"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Vol. 51",1076-2752,"Martin, B.C.; Church, T.S.; Bonnell, R.; Ben-Joseph, R.; Borgstadt, T.",10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181965d6e,2009,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; Pennington Biomedical Research Center; Human Centric Software; Sanofi-Aventis; Trestle Tree,Sanofi-Aventis,"Objective: The primary goal of the study was to quantify health care costs of truckers across categories of normal weight, overweight, and obese.

One central component of the revised HOS regulations was a one-hour increase in allowable driving time, from 10 to 11 h. The current study evaluated the impact of the additional driving-hour on critical incident risk. Data from a naturalistic truck driving study, which resulted in over 2 million driving miles of continuously collected data, were analyzed. Driving hour bins (hours 1 through 11) were created and the frequency of critical incidents for each hour, and trips (opportunities) per each hour, were identified. A relative frequency was then calculated (critical incidents divided by opportunities) for each hour and odds ratios were determined. Analyses found an elevated risk in the 1st driving-hour, but no consistent significant difference between hours 2 through 11. Analyses on time-of-day, where incident rates were calculated for each of the 24h in the day, were also conducted. The results found a strong positive correlation to national traffic density data. As an impact on U.S. national transportation policy, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is an increased risk resulting from CMV drivers driving in the 11th driving-hour as compared to the 10th driving-hour, or any hour.

The revised hours-of-service (HOS)regulations (in the United States) are in place to provide drivers with more opportunities to get sleep. However, are drivers really getting moresleep under these new regulations? Also, is there a relationship between sleep quantity and involvement in critical incident (crashes, near-crashes, or crash-relevant conflicts)? Data from 73 truck drivers, collected during a naturalistic driving study after the implementation of the 2003HOS regulations, were analyzed to determine overall sleep quantity (using actigraphy), along with sleep quantity prior to being involved in a critical incident. Sixty-two drivers had at least seven consecutive days (Monday through Sunday) of reliable actigraphy data; mean sleep quantity per 24-h period (midnight centered using the Cole-Kripke algorithm) for these drivers was 6.28 h (S.D. = 1.42 h). Fifty-eight critical incidents were recorded in the 10th and 11th driving hours. Analysis results indicated that drivers received significantly less sleep in the period prior to a critical incident as compared to their mean overall sleep quantity. The results of this study indicate drivers may be getting more sleep under the revised2003 HOS regulations as compared to the old regulations. In addition, significantly less sleep in the 24-h period prior to involvement in a critical incident suggests driver fatigue may have been a potential contributing factor in these critical incidents.

Other data document that 1) 17%-57% of normal young adults have MSLT latencies of less than or equal to 5.5 minutes, whereas less than or equal to 50% have MSLT values of greater than or equal to 10 minutes and 2) 28%-29% of young adults reported normally sleeping less than or equal to 6.5 hours on each weeknight. More extensive reduction of daily sleep amount is seen in night-shift workers. A minimum of 2%-4% of middle-aged adults have hypersomnolence associated with sleep apnea. Together, these data show that significant sleep loss exists in one-third or more of normal adults, that the effects are large and replicable and that similar effects can be produced in just 1 night in the laboratory. In light of the magnitude of this sleep debt, it is not surprising that fatigue is a factor in 57% of accidents leading to the death of a truck driver and in 10% of fatal car accidents and results in costs of up to 56 billion dollars per year. A recent sleep extension study suggests that the average underlying sleep tendency in young adults is about 8.5 hours per night.

The objective is todetermine whether advanced ejection-mitigating glazing in passenger cars, light trucks, and vanswould result in substantial benefits in terms of fatality and injury reductions.  As part of theproject, it was necessary to estimate the numbers of lives saved and serious injuries preventedwhen ejection is eliminated.This report describes the statistical analysis performed to obtain such estimates.  The analysisutilized state data files maintained by NCSA.  It employs the double-pair comparisonmethodology to compare the injury rates on various severity levels among the ejected and thenon-ejected vehicle occupants.  It also allows one to calculate fractional reductions in fatalitiesand incapacitating injuries due to ejection prevention.  Since ejection is rare among occupantsof motor vehicle using the safety belts, the analysis is restricted to the unrestrained occupants.The results show dramatically lower fatality rates among non-ejected occupants compared withthose ejected ones in the same crash, and substantially lower incapacitating injury rates.  Therelative risk of fatality of ejected to non-ejected individuals in all ejection crashes is 3.55 fordrivers and 3.15 for front seat passengers, which translates into 72 percent and 68 percentreductions in fatalities when ejection is eliminated, respectively.  The relative risk ofincapacitating injury (given no fatality) is estimated to be 2.39 for drivers and 1.95 for passenger,which means 58 percent and 49 percent reductions in incapacitating injuries, respectively.An analysis by crash type shows that the greatest benefits of ejection prevention occur in rollovercrashes (7.16 relative risk of fatality and 86 percent reduction in fatalities for drivers, and 9.94relative risk of fatality and 90 percent reduction in fatalities for passengers).Furthermore, an analysis by vehicle type shows particularly large benefits of ejection preventionin light trucks.  For drivers of light trucks in ejection crashes the relative risk of fatality is 5.62and for passengers it is 4.66 (compared with the non-ejected occupant).  The fractional reductionin fatalities is then estimated as 82 percent for drivers and 78.5 percent for passengers whenejection is eliminated from these vehicles.",Government Report,"Docket Number NHTSA-1996-1782-18, DOT HS 808 369"2127-AK23,,18,Fatality reduction by Safety Belts for Front-Seat Occupants of Cars and Light Trucks,National Highway Traffic Safety Association,,"Charles J.

The standard applies to the side windows next to the first three rows of seats, and to a portion of the cargo area behind the first or second rows, in motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 4,536 kilogram (kg) or less (10,000 pounds (lb) or less). To assess compliance, the agency is adopting a test in which an impactor is propelled from inside a test vehicle toward the windows. The ejection mitigation safety system is required to prevent the impactor from moving more than a specified distance beyond the plane of a window. To ensure that the systems cover the entire opening of each window for the duration of a rollover, each side window will be impacted at up to four locations around its perimeter at two time intervals following deployment.The agency anticipates that manufacturers will meet the standard by modifying existing side impact air bag curtains, and possibly supplementing them with advanced glazing. The curtains will be made larger so that they cover more of the window opening, made more robust to remain inflated longer, and made to deploy in both side impacts and in rollovers. In addition, after deployment the curtains will be tethered near the base of the vehicle's pillars or otherwise designed to keep the impactor within the boundaries established by the performance test. This final rule adopts a phase-in of the new requirements, starting September 1, 2013.This final rule advances NHTSA's initiatives in rollover safety and also responds to Section 10301 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

We refer to the resulting smaller set of products as the individual's choice set; (b) choose among products in the choice set using a fairly simple logit model. The nested logit model (McFadden, 1978; 1983) is one common example of this model in which choice sets are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Unfortunately, there is strong empirical evidence suggesting that automobile buyers have overlapping choice sets. Thus, some buyers will consider both small and medium-sized cars whereas other buyers will consider both large and medium-sized cars. Hence, the nested logit model appears to unrealistically limit the allowable patterns of interproduct similarity. To avoid these problems, I allow choise sets to overlap but will restrict all choice sets to include the same number of products. As I describe, the resulting model is estimable with data on individual first and second choice preferences.

Several conclusions follow from our analysis regarding the potential sources of market failure and possible remedies.

This study estimated how adding mass, in the form of a passenger, to a car crashing head-on into another car affects fatality risks to both drivers. The study distinguished the causal roles of mass and size. Methods. Head-on crashes between 2 cars, one with a right-front passenger and the other with only a driver, were examined with Fatality Analysis Reporting System data.  Results. Adding a passenger to a car led to a 14.5% reduction in driver risk ratio (risk to one driver divided by risk to the other). To divide this effect between the individual drivers, the author developed equations that express each driver's risk as a function of causal contributions from the mass and size of both involved cars. Adding a passenger reduced a driver's frontal crash fatality risk by 7.5% but increased the risk to the other driver by 8.1%.  Conclusions. The presence of a passenger reduces a driver's frontal crash fatality risk but increases the risk to the driver of the other car. The findings are applicable to some single-car crashes, in which the driver risk decrease is not offset by any increase in harm to others. When all cars carry the same additional cargo, total population risk is reduced.",Scholarly Journal,2127-AK43,,6,A Primer on the Major Issues Relating to the Discount Rate for Evaluating National Energy Options,In Discounting for Time and Risks in Energy Policy,,"Lind, R.C.",,1982,,,,Book,2127-AK43,,6,Monte Carlo Statistical Methods,,,"Robert, CP; Casella, G",,1999,,,,Book,"pringer-Verlag New York, Inc"2127-AK43,,6,Monte Carlo Strategies in Scientific Computing,,,"Liu, JS",,2001,,,,Book,"Springer-Verlag New York, Inc"2127-AK43,,6,Wards 2008 Automotive Yearbook,,,"Binder, Alan ",,7/1/08,,,,Book,Wards Communications2127-AK43,,6,Fatality Analysis Reporting System Encyclopedia,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,Database,Available at http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx2127-AK43,,6,National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates Systems,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,Database,Available at http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/National+Automotive+Sampling+System+%28NASS%29/NASS+General+Estimates+System2127-AK43,,6,Fatalaties and Injuries in Motor Vehicle Backing Crashes,Department of Transporation,,,DOT HS 811 144,8-Nov,,,,Government Report,Available at http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811144.pdf2127-AK43,,6,"On-Road Study of Drivers_ Use of Rearview Video Systems""",National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,"Mazzae, Elizabeth ",,,,,,Government Report,Available at http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2FDOT%2FNHTSA%2FNRD%2FMultimedia%2FPDFs%2FHuman%2520Factors%2FVisibility%2520and%2520Lighting%2FVisibility%2F811024.pdf&ei=DnyZUN_IKubF0AHZg4DwCQ&usg=AFQjCNHQk7saDtaikhRjXDVDCluOfOffrw&sig2=h4zTttbYIBkH_fHfJc8Hjg2127-AK43,,6,Rear Visbility and Backing Risks in Crashes,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,8-Dec,,,,Government Report,Unpublished Paper from the Mathematical Analysis Division 2127-AK43,,6,The ability of rear-mounted convex mirrors to improve rear visbility,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,"Garrot, W.; Mazzae, Elizabeth ",,,,,,Government Report,Available at http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv21/09-0558.pdf2127-AK43,,6,The Economic Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes 2000,Department of Transporation,,"Blincoe, L; Seay, A; Zaloshnja, E; Miller, T; Romano, E; Luchter, S; Spicer, R",DOT HS 809 446,2-May,,,,Government Report,2127-AK43,,6,Light Vehicle Rear Visibility Assessment,Department of Transporation,,,DOT HS 810 909,8-Sep,,,,Government Report ,2127-AK43,,6,Not-in-Traffic Surveillance,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,2007,,,,Government Report ,2127-AK43,,6,S.

We are currently working with ultrasonic rear parking assist systems, rear radar backing warning systems, and rear camera systems, which are briefly described and their utility for assisting drivers in recognizing people or objects behind them discussed. Our research on driver performance with a prototype long range backing warning system found that audible and visual warning combinations may not be effective in warning distracted drivers about unexpected objects. Driver expectancy is thought to play a significant role in this result. However, further research found drivers were more likely to notice an unexpected obstacle behind their vehicle with a prototype rear view video camera system compared to ultrasonic rear parking assist and trials that had no system. These results suggest that rear view video camera systems may provide limited benefit in some backing scenarios. While parking assist systems may assist drivers with parking tasks, they are not designed to be warning systems and may not effectively warn drivers of unexpected obstacles. We continue to pursue work with rear view video camera systems including integration with object detection sensors.

Rear-end collision avoidance systems (RECASs) may offer a promising approach to help drivers avoid these crashes. Two experiments performed using a high-fidelity motion-based driving simulator examined driver responses to evaluate the efficacy of a RECAS. The first experiment showed that early warnings helped distracted drivers react more quickly - and thereby avoid more collisions - than did late warnings or no warnings. Compared with the no-warning condition, an early RECAS warning reduced the number of collisions by 80.7%. Assuming collision severity is proportional to kinetic energy, the early warning reduced collision severity by 96.5%. In contrast, the late warning reduced collisions by 50.0% and the corresponding severity by 87.5%. The second experiment showed that RECAS benefits even undistracted drivers. Analysis of the braking process showed that warnings provide a potential safety benefit by reducing the time required for drivers to release the accelerator. Warnings do not, however, speed application of the brake, increase maximum deceleration, or affect mean deceleration. These results provide the basis for a computational model of driver performance that was used to extrapolate the findings and identify the most promising parameter settings. Potential applications of these results include methods for evaluating collision warning systems, algorithm design guidance, and driver performance model input.

Interface testing used a minivan and a passenger sedan equipped with a prototype rear obstacle detection system. Two different warning timing algorithms and four different interface conditions were examined. The appropriateness of the warning timing algorithms was tested using an alerted backing procedure wherein drivers backed to known obstacles and braked in response to the warning. A surprise event scenario was also included in order to examine driver reaction to the warning under unexpected conditions. Alerted backing results suggest that although both timing algorithms led to few target strikes, one algorithm led to more acceptable ratings, fewer target strikes and close calls, and less urgent braking.

This study links case-level data from the Federal Railroad Administration to monetary costs and consequences of specific injuries. Lost quality of life was estimated from physicians' ratings of injury impairment and the value of fatal risk reduction. Railroad injuries and illnesses cause an average of $3 billion in fatality costs and $650 million in nonfatal incident costs annually. Impacts at rail-highway crossings impose three times as much cost as the next highest cause. Commercial air travel is the safest per passenger mile. Trains, second lowest, have injury costs six times higher, but only one-fifth as high as cars. The relative safety of trains and airplanes in transport means highway modes enjoy implicit price subsidies. Better injury cost recovery through taxation or insurance would make the subsidies explicit. More informed modal choices and thus enhanced economic efficiency would result.",Scholarly Journal,2130-AB69,,20,Cost-Benefit Default Principles,Michigan Law Review,0026-2234,"Sunstein, Cass R",10.2307/1290477,1-Jun,University of Chicago,,"Courts should be reluctant to apply the literal terms of a statute to mandate pointless expenditures of effort.... Unless Congress has been extraordinarily rigid, there is likely a basis for an implication of de minimis authority to provide exemption when the burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value.(1) It seems bizarre that a statute intended to improve human health would... lock the agency into looking at only one half of a substance's health effects in determining the maximum level for that (2) substance. [I]t is only where there is ""clear congressional intent to preclude consideration of cost"" that we find agencies barred from considering Costs.(3) In order better to achieve regulatory goals - for example, to allocate resources so that they save more lives or produce a cleaner environment - regulators must often take account of all of a proposed regulation's adverse effects, at least where those effects clearly threaten serious and disproportionate public harm. Hence, I believe that, other things being equal, we should read silences or ambiguities in the language of regulatory statutes as permitting, not forbidding, this type of rational regulation.(4) The rule-implicit valuation of a life is high - about $4 million - but not so astronomical, certainly by regulatory standards, as to call the rationality of the rule seriously into question, especially when we consider that neither Hepatitis B nor AIDS is a disease of old people. These diseases are no respecters of youth; they cut off people in their working years, and thus in their prime, and it is natural to set a high value on the lost years.(5).",Scholarly Journal,2130-AC03,,22,Safeware: System Safety and Computers,"Addison-Wesley Publishing Company",,"Leveson, Nancy G",,1995,,,,Book,2130-AC03,,22,1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study,Federal Highway Administration,,,,1997,,,,Government Report,2130-AC03,,22,Quantification of the Business Benefits of Positive Train Control,Zeta-Tech Associates,,,,2004,,,"The purpose of this analysis is to quantify the “business benefits” of Positive Train Control (PTC for the Class I freight railroad industry1. Positive Train Control is a concept, rather than a single technology or system. It can include many differentcapabilities, covering a range of railroad functions. The three components of PTC are the on-board computer (OBC) with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) location capability, a dedicated wireless digital data link between locomotives and a controlcenter, and the central office hardware and software at the control center. Through use of a digital data link and real-time train location information, PTC can be a train controlsystem. The digital data link and the OBC can be used for positive safety enforcement, stopping trains if movement authorities are exceeded. The same data link may also beused to transmit work instructions to train crews, receive acknowledgment of completed work, or transmit locomotive diagnostic information in real time. This report does not address the safety benefits of PTC. These were previously quantified by the Rail Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC)2, which identified nearly a thousand “PPAs” (PTCpreventable accidents) on U.S. railroads over a 12-year period, and determined thesavings to be realized from each avoided accident. The RSAC finding was thatavoidance of these PPAs was not, by itself, sufficient (from a strictly economic point of view) to justify an investment in PTC",Non-Government Report,2130-AC27,,3,"Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee",Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,,,,5-Jul,,,,Hearing,2130-AC27,,3, U.S. DOT/FRA - Positive Train Control Systems,,,,,,,,,Regulation,FRA-2008-0132-00602137-AE15,,10,Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2005,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,,,,7-Feb,,,,Government Report,2137-AE15,,10,Comparative Assessment of Natural Gas Accident Risks,,,"Burgherr, Peter; Hirschberg, Stefan",,5-Jan,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,Comparative Risks of Hazardous Materials and Non-Hazardous Materials Truck Shipment Accidents/Incidents,FMCSA,,,,1-Mar,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,Docket RSPA-2004-19854,,,,,,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,House of Representatives report 108-792,,,,,20-Nov-04,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,House of Representatives report 108-792,,,,,20-Nov-04,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,How to Comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act,,,,,,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,Integrity Management for Gas Distribution,,,,,5-Dec,,,,Government Report ,2137-AE15,,10,"Integrity Management for Gas Distribution, Report of Phase 1 Investigations",,,,"U.S. DOT/PHMSA - Report: DIMP Phase 1, Doc.

Recent research indicates that there is geographical concentration of subprime mortgages in Census tracts where there are high concentrations of low-income and minority households. The growth in subprime lending represents an expansion in the supply of mortgage credit among households who do not meet prime market underwriting standards. Nonetheless, its apparent concentration in minority and lower income neighborhoods has generated concerns that these households may not be obtaining equal opportunity in the prime mortgage market.

Relying principally on a survey conducted for Freddie Mac by the Gallup Organization, we provide an overview of subprime lending, characterize the types of borrowers in this market segment, and assess the service they receive from lenders. We find that subprime borrowers generally are higher-risk than their prime counterparts and pay higher rates and fees for their mortgages. They are disproportionately minority and lower income, older, less well educated, less financially sophisticated, and less likely to search for the best interest rate when applying for a mortgage. We use three measures to assess the efficiency of the subprime market.

Poor organization of public records led title insurers in the U.S. to integrate title examination and settlement services. Their residual claimant status motivates insurers to screen, cure and avoid title defects. Firms introducing title insurance abroad produce little information on title quality, however. Their policies are instead issued on a casualty basis, complementing and enforcing the professional liability of conveyancers.

Most states, however, require that firms offering mortgage or title insurance operate on a monoline basis, meaning that an insurance firm may provide coverage against only one type of risk. This paper investigates the conditions under which monoline restrictions represent efficient regulatory policy. Monoline requirements are an intriguing issue because multiline insurance firms receive the diversification benefit that the firm's capital is available to pay insurance claims on any of its lines.

We consider the impact of the market power of individual loan officers on overages paid by borrowers, particularly minorities. We include numerous borrower and lender characteristics unavailable previously.  We find that minorities who purchase homes pay larger overages than whites, but our evidence suggests that this traces to differences in the pools of borrowers rather than to racial discrimination. We conclude that a more effective way to eliminate racial differences in overages is to increase minorities' ability to bargain rather than to enact additional anti-discrimination laws.",Scholarly Journal,2502-AI61,,8,Encouraging Mortgage Lending in 'Underserved Areas': The Potential for Expanding Homeownership in the U.S. ,Housing Studies,0267-3037,"Galster, George; Laudan, Aron; Reeder, William",,Nov-99,Wayne State University; The Urban Institute; US Department of Housing and Urban Development,,"This study estimates the size of the potential US home owner market and examines the relative default risks associated with expanded home ownership among lower-income, 'underserved' households. Using the 1990 SIPP database, a logit model is developed that predicts the likelihood that a renter household will move into home ownership during an 18-month period. Parameters are estimated using a white, suburban renter sub-population. These are then applied to a nationally-representative sample of renter households to produce an aggregate, expected number of transitions into home ownership. The difference between this expected number and the actual number of transitions represents the baseline estimate of the number of additional transitions that might be expected were lending practices and conditions prevailing for whites in suburban areas to be applied everywhere else. The relative default risks are assessed of these potential home owners and the renter households who moved into home ownership by applying a well-known default probability equation. The resulting distributions of default probabilities are then compared, using low- and median-priced housing cost assumptions and for several income groups. In the extended phase of the analysis, an estimation is made of various pools of prospective home owners that might be tapped with more aggressive lending policies. These prospective home owners have both a large propensity to make the move into home ownership (relative to those that actually do), and do not present above average default risks were they to do so. The baseline analyses indicate that just over 600 000 (2.1 per cent) more US renter households would become home owners during the period if they could buy low-cost homes and the underwriting practices and opportunities found in white suburban areas were applied uniformly across the nation. If they were limited to purchase of a median-cost home, this figure drops slightly to 522 000 (1.85 per cent). Extended analyses suggest that up to 2.71 million low-to-moderate income renter households (7.6 per cent of all renter households) should prove more attractive to mortgage lenders than the average first-time home buyer and possess a relatively high probability of moving into home ownership.",Scholarly Journal,2502-AI61,,8,Subprime Borrowers: Mortgage Transitions and Outcomes,Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics,0895-5638,"Courchane, Marsha J; Surette, Brian J; Zorn, Peter M",10.1023/B:REAL.0000044019.57580.18,4-Dec,Welch Consulting; Freddie Mac,,"Public policy concerns increasingly have focused on subprime lending. Our research uses a survey of prime and subprime borrowers to address whether borrowers ""inappropriately"" are channeled to the subprime segment, if once having taken out a subprime mortgage borrowers are ""stuck"" in this market segment, and whether borrowers face higher costs by taking out subprime mortgages.  We find that subprime borrowers are less knowledgeable about the mortgage process, are less likely to search for the best mortgage rates, and are less likely to be offered a choice among alternative mortgage terms and instruments possibly making them more vulnerable to unfavorable mortgage outcomes. Our analysis of market segmentation confirms that typical mortgage underwriting criteria are most important in explaining whether borrowers obtain prime or subprime mortgages higher credit risk borrowers are more likely to get a subprime loan. Our results further show that search behavior and other demographic factors including adverse life events, age, and Hispanic ethnicity contribute to explaining market segment, suggesting that borrowers may inappropriately receive subprime mortgages. While we find some persistence to market segment borrowers are more likely to takeout a subprime mortgage if their previous mortgage came from the subprime segment we also find that market segment is not immutable.  Analysis of the survey responses indicates that borrowers with subprime mortgages significantly are more dissatisfied with their mortgage outcomes. This is not surprising because subprime borrowers look worse across typical mortgage underwriting criteria. Consistent with policy concerns, however, despite holding constant these and other factors, taking out a mortgage in the subprime segment, by itself, appears to increase dissatisfaction with mortgage outcomes.  We do not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether subprime lending, on balance, serves homebuyers well by providing access to mortgage credit to those otherwise constrained, or rather serves homebuyers poorly by inappropriately assigning them to a market where costs are high and the ability to transition to more attractive prime mortgages remains low. Our analysis, however, does provide some empirical support for concerns raised by critics of subprime lending, and for this reason justifies continued public policy debate and analysis.",Scholarly Journal,2900-AN23,,6,VetPop Data,"VA Office of theActuary",,,,,,,,Government Report,2900-AN23,,6,Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,,,,,,,,,Regulation,44 U.S.C. 3501-35212900-AN23,,6,68 FR 2669,,,,,3-Jan,,,,RIA,RIN 2900–AL519000-AK91,,7,Average annual salary of federal employees within the United States,,,,,,,,,Database,http://www.opm.gov/feddata/html/paystructure/2004/table2.asp9000-AK91,,7,Census information on education ,U.S. Census Bureau,,,,2006,,,,Database,http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/education/cps2006/tab10-01.xls9000-AK91,,7,"E-Verifyprogram",,,,,7-Jun,,,,Database,9000-AK91,,7,Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation,Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation,,,,,,,,Database,9000-AK91,,7,Inflation adjustment,,,,,,,,,Database,http://www.bls.gov/bls/inflation.htm9000-AK91,,7,"Privately Owned Vehicle Reimbursement Rates,",,,,,7-Feb,,,,Database,http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentId=9646&contentType=GSA_BASIC9000-AK91,,7,www.sba.gov/advo/research/data_uspdf.xls,,,,,,,,,Database,www.sba.gov/advo/research/data_uspdf.xls9000-AK91,,7,,http://www.ssa.gov/otherssasites/,,,,,,,,Database,http://www.ssa.gov/otherssasites/9000-AK91,,7,Executive Order 12989,,,,,Feb-96,,,,Federal Regulation,61 FR 60919000-AK91,,7,Executive Order 12989,,,,,Feb-96,,,,Federal Regulation,Executive Order 129899000-AK91,,7,Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ,,,,,1996,,,,Federal Regulation,9000-AK91,,7,Immigration Reform and Control Act,,,,,5-Jun,,,,Federal Regulation,9000-AK91,,7,"“Characteristicsand Pay of Federal Civilian Employees”",Congressional Budget Office,,,,2007,,,,Government Report,"www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/78xx/doc7874/03-15-Federal_Personnel.pdf."9000-AK91,,7,Basic Pilot program,,,,,7-Jun,,,,Government Report,9000-AK91,,7,Employer Costs for Employee Compensation,Department of Labor,,,,7-Mar,,,,Government Report,9000-AK91,,7,Job Openings and Labor Turnover,Bureau of Labor Statistics,,,,7-Jan,,,,Government Report,9000-AK91,,7,"National Compensation Survey OccupationalEarnings in the United States",Department of Labor,,,,7-Sep,,,,Government Report,http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/sp/ncbl0961.pdf9000-AK91,,7,Westat Report,,,,,2-Jan,,,,Government Report,http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/5%5b1%5d.f%20C_X.pdf9000-AK91,,7,Congressional Hearing,,,,,,,,,Hearing,"H.R.Rep. 107-310 at 2; H.R.

We examine this issue empirically using data on securitized subprime mortgage loan contracts in the United States. We exploit a specific rule of thumb in the lending market to generate exogenous variation in the ease of securitization and compare the composition and performance of lenders' portfolios around the ad hoc threshold. Conditional on being securitized, the portfolio with greater ease of securitization defaults by around 10%-25% more than a similar risk profile group with a lesser ease of securitization. We conduct additional analyses to rule out differential selection by market participants around the threshold and lenders employing an optimal screening cutoff unrelated to securitization as alternative explanations. The results are confined to loans where intermediaries' screening effort may be relevant and soft information about borrowers determines their creditworthiness. Our findings suggest that existing securitization practices did adversely affect the screening incentives of subprime lenders.",Scholarly Journal,1557-AD40,7100-AD70; 3064-AD74; 2590-AA43; 3235-AK96; 2501-AD63,,The Credit Ratings Game,Journal of Finance,0022-1082,"Bolton, P; Freixas, X; Shapiro, J",10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01708.x,12-Feb,Columbia University; Universitat Pompeu Fabra; University of Oxford,Spanish Government; Fundacion Ramon Areces; The Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya,"The collapse of AAA-rated structured finance products in 2007 to 2008 has brought renewed attention to conflicts of interest in credit rating agencies (CRAs). We model competition among CRAs with three sources of conflicts: (1) CRAs conflict of understating risk to attract business, (2) issuers ability to purchase only the most favorable ratings, and (3) the trusting nature of some investor clienteles. These conflicts create two distortions. First, competition can reduce efficiency, as it facilitates ratings shopping. Second, ratings are more likely to be inflated during booms and when investors are more trusting.

In the model, asset issuers can shop for ratings-observe multiple ratings and disclose only the most favorable-before auctioning their assets. When assets are simple, agencies' ratings are similar and the incentive to ratings shop is low. When assets are sufficiently complex, ratings differ enough that an incentive to shop emerges. Thus, an increase in the complexity of recently issued securities could create a systematic bias in disclosed ratings, despite the fact that each ratings agency produces an unbiased estimate of the asset's true quality. Increasing competition among agencies would only worsen this problem.

The sharp increase in mortgage defaults in 2007 is significantly amplified in subprime ZIP codes, or ZIP codes with a disproportionately large share of subprime borrowers as of 1996. Prior to the default crisis, these subprime ZIP codes experience an unprecedented relative growth in mortgage credit. The expansion in mortgage credit from 2002 to 2005 to subprime ZIP codes occurs despite sharply declining relative (and in some cases absolute) income growth in these neighborhoods. In fact, 2002 to 2005 is the only period in the past eighteen years in which income and mortgage credit growth are negatively correlated.

Repo transactions are collateralized, frequently with securitized bonds. We refer to the combination of securitization plus repo finance as ""securitized banking"" and argue that these activities were at the nexus of the crisis. We use a novel data set that includes credit spreads for hundreds of securitized bonds to trace the path of the crisis from subprime-housing related assets into markets that had no connection to housing. We find that changes in the LIB-OIS spread, a proxy for counterparty risk, were strongly correlated with changes in credit spreads and repo rates for securitized bonds. These changes implied higher uncertainty about bank solvency and lower values for repo collateral. Concerns about the liquidity of markets for the bonds used as collateral led to increases in repo haircuts, that is the amount of collateral required for any given transaction. With declining asset values and increasing haircuts, the US banking system was effectively insolvent for the first time since the Great Depression.",Scholarly Journal,1557-AD40,7100-AD70; 3064-AD74; 2590-AA43; 3235-AK96; 2501-AD72,,Liquidity Shortages and Banking Crises,Journal of Finance,0022-1082,"Diamond, D; Rajan, R",10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00741.x,5-Apr,University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; International Monetary Fund,National Science Foundation; Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago; George J.

This could lead to a contagion of failures and a total meltdown of the system. Given the costs of a meltdown, there is a possible role for government intervention.

After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was a run by short-term bank creditors, making it difficult for banks to roll over their short term debt. We find that there was a simultaneous run by borrowers who drew down their credit lines, leading to a spike in commercial and industrial loans reported on bank balance sheets. We examine whether these two stresses on bank liquidity led them to cut lending. In particular, we show that banks cut their lending less if they had better access to deposit financing and thus, they were not as reliant on short-term debt.
