identifying plant ownership and compiling the list of potentially affected small entities 1 Operating and capital costs Using the IPM parsed outputs for the base case and the proposed Toxics Rule policy case EPA identified units that installed one or more pollution control technologies under the proposed rule The equations for calculating operating and capital costs were adopted from technology assumptions used in EPA‘s version of IPM version 410 The model calculates the capital cost in MW the fixed operation and maintenance OM cost in MWyear and the variable OM cost in MWh,14 Description of Significant Alternatives As required by RFA section 609b as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act SBREFA EPA conducted outreach to small entities and convened a Small Business Advocacy Review SBAR Panel composed of EPA the Small Business Administration SBA and the Office of Management and Budget OMB to obtain the advice and recommendations of small entity

presents EPA’s estimates of benefits and social costs for Option 4 for existing facilities at 3 percent a The benefit values presented in this table are the estimated “mean” values Additional “low” and “high” value estimates are presented,Table 136 provides additional detail on net benefits this Table compiles the time profiles of benefits and social costs for Option 4 Table 136 also reports the discounted present value and annualized value of benefits and costs Source US EPA Analysis,1333 Analysis Impact on Small Governments As presented in Table 139 costs are lower for small governments in comparison to large governments in the aggregate and approximately the same on a per facility basis Under Option 1 the 10 facilities owned by small 224 Maximum per facility values are reported on an unweighted basis,1334 Analysis Summary Table 1310 presents a summary of compliance costs under Option 4 for publicly and privatelyowned facilities along with government administrative costs for each regulatory option,For Option 4 EPA estimates total annual compliance costs for governmentowned Electric Generators at 95 million NPDES permitting authorities are expected to incur another 32 million per year to implement this option for both Electric Generators and Manufacturers resulting in a total annual cost of approximately 127 million for State and local governments The maximum compliance cost for governmentowned Electric Generators in any one year under Option 4 is 176 million in 2033 The maximum administrative cost to NPDES authorities in any single year for administering this option is 40,134 Cost and Economic Impact Analysis – Manufacturers a EPA was unable to determine revenues for 9 parent entities,135 Cost and Economic Impact Analysis – Electric Generators 1351 CosttoRevenue Analysis FacilityLevel Screening Analysis Table 1313 reports facilitylevel costtorevenue results for Option 4 by North American Reliability Corporation NERC region226 EPA estimates that 488 Electric Generators facilities subject to the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule will on incur annualized costs of less than 1 percent of revenue under,226 NERC is responsible for the overall reliability planning and coordination of the power grids it is organized into regional councils that are responsible for the overall coordination of bulk power policies that affect their regions’ reliability and quality of service see Chapter 2H Profile of the Electric Power Industry As noted previously NERC region definitions have recently changed,No explicitly analyzed facilities are located in the ASCC region For more information on explicitly and implicitly analyzed facilities see Appendix 3A Use of Sample Weights in the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule Analyses Source US EPA Analysis,DOE 2007c Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316b Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13 Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option,136 Assessing the Potential Impact of the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule on Small Entities – Regulatory Flexibility Act RFA Analysis 1361 Analysis of Manufacturers As reported in Table 1318 for Option 4 EPA estimated that no small entities within the Primary Manufacturing Industries or entities owning facilities in Other Industries would receive costs exceeding 1 or 3 percent of revenue under either of the sampleweighting approaches used for this analysis Thus this option would have no material impact on small Manufacturers entities,SBA,1363 Overall Small Entity Impact Assessment for Option 4 Abt Associates,Research and Markets The US Chemical
